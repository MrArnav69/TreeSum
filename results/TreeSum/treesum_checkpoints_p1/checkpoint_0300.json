The vehicles, like many in Turkey, were powered by liquefied petroleum gas, making them more likely to explode, he said. \n \n \"It is highly probable that it's a terror attack,\" he said. \"The explosion took place in a parked car, and was followed by explosions of other cars because they had LPG.\" \n \n President Abdullah Gul, visiting Germany, condemned what he said was a terrorist attack. \n \n \"Those who have had no share of humanity carried out a terror attack against civilians in Ankara. We have fatalities. I send them my condolences and with hatred condemn the terror,\" Gul said, according to state-run Anatolian news agency. \n \n A plume of thick smoke rose above the heart of the city after the blast. Reuters reporters at the scene said a line of parked vehicles had been destroyed and an adjacent row of shops was damaged, across the street from a primary school. \n \n Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene and police set up a security cordon while bomb disposal teams' sniffer dogs searched for any possible secondary device. \n \n Sahin said the three people who were killed had been in nearby buildings. Of the 15 people who were wounded, five were in a critical condition. \n \n \"Kumrular street is a busy place in terms of human and vehicle traffic. It's seen that the explosion mainly targeted people,\" he said. \n \n Kurdish separatists, leftists and Islamist militants have carried out bomb attacks in Turkish cities in the past. \n \n Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was in the United States and was due to hold talks with President Barack Obama later in the day. \n \n (Writing by Daren Butler and Simon Cameron-Moore; Editing by Peter Graff) ||||| A suspected car bomb exploded across a secondary school in the Turkish capital on Tuesday, wounding 15 people, authorities said. \n \n There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack comes at a time when Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey have escalated their attacks on Turkish targets. The rebels carried out deadly bomb attacks in Turkish cities in the past. Islamic and leftist militants were also behind some bombings in this NATO-member and U.S. ally country. \n \n \"There is information that a bomb was planted on the vehicle,\" that exploded in the downtown Kizilay district, said Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc. \n \n The blast wounded 15 people, said Besir Atalay, another deputy prime minister.

And that\u2019s unlikely if not impossible. \n \n NBC News' Richard Engel reports from inside the difficult-to-reach Coastal Cluster in Sochi. \n \n \u201cAs far as being able to do things without Russian cooperation, it\u2019s basically a nonstarter,\u201d said Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a former Russia expert in the Clinton White House and an NBC News analyst. \n \n \u201cThis is their territory, their country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get to decide what kind of outside help they need.\u201d \n \n Fears of Olympic terror have grown in the countdown to the games, which formally open Feb. 7. In the past week, a militant video has promised a \u201csurprise\u201d in Sochi, and Russia has hunted for at least five suspected terrorists who may have designs on an attack. \n \n On Tuesday, police said they had killed a senior Islamist militant in Russia's North Caucasus as they hunted three Muslim women dubbed \u201cblack widows\u201d and other terror suspects ahead of the Winter Olympics. \n \n So while Putin\u2019s ring of steel may help thwart larger coordinated attacks, experts are warning that lone attackers also pose a significant threat to the Games. \n \n According to Gordon Woo, terrorism expert at risk management modeling firm RMS, analysis shows that terror plots involving up to 10 operatives have a 5 percent chance of succeeding. \n \n Ezra Shaw / Getty Images Snowboarder Kelly Clark at a competition earlier this month. \n \n \"Smart terrorists\" rein in their ambition and aim for simpler plots with fewer operatives, he said. \n \n The U.S. Olympic Committee declined to discuss the details of security for the American athletes or what would happen in the event of an evacuation. \n \n \u201cThe safety and security of Team USA is our top priority,\u201d Patrick Sandusky, a USOC spokesman, said in a statement. \n \n \u201cAs is always the case, we are working with the U.S. Department of State, the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe,\u201d he said. \n \n But at least part of the American contingent for Sochi, the skiing and snowboard teams, is paying a private company, Global Rescue, for additional security. \n \n The company promises communications help, \u201crally points\u201d for athletes to shelter in place and ways to get them around, or out of, Sochi. Dan Richards, the CEO, said in an interview that Global Rescue has six aircraft that it could \u201cutilize for rapid response.\u201d \n \n Exactly how that would work \u2014 a private security company landing its planes in or around Sochi in the immediate aftermath of an attack \u2014 is not clear, and Richards declined to provide details of the company\u2019s plans. \n \n Global Rescue also offers its services to individuals and companies, and in recent years has helped customers during the Arab Spring, the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan. \n \n Counterterrorism analyst Michael Leiter says transportation in Russia is vulnerable in the high-threat areas surrounding Sochi. The terrorists who previously launched an attack, he said, have every incentive to do so again. \n \n \u201cIn every major crisis we\u2019ve been involved with, we\u2019ve never had host governments deny us overflight or landing permission,\u201d he said. \u201cThe likelihood is that we\u2019ll all work together, the Russians, our government, other friendly government and other private companies.\u201d \n \n Richards would not say what the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association is paying for the additional protection. The skiers and snowboarders are among the richer American teams. \n \n The American luge team \u2014 10 athletes and four coaches, plus medical and support staff \u2014 will rely on the U.S. Olympic Committee, said Gordy Sheer, the team\u2019s director of marketing and sponsorship. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re working pretty hard, and we\u2019ve been given a lot of assurances,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cI feel that the USOC is really making it a priority, and obviously the Russians are as well.\u201d \n \n There are signs of concern among American athletes. Some, including at least two members of the high-profile hockey team, have told their families not to travel to Sochi to cheer them on. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m actually really concerned about it,\u201d Zach Parise, one of the hockey players, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul. \u201cI know they say they have evacuation stuff for us and all, but you just never know. I guess you have to wonder at what point does someone say it isn\u2019t a good idea for us to go.\u201d \n \n The biathlon team has bought satellite phones for its coaches and is recommending that traveling families of its 10 athletes purchase medical and evacuation insurance \u2014 the same already provided to Olympic athletes by the USOC \u2014 should anything go wrong, said Max Cobb, president and CEO of U.S. Biathlon. \n \n Other American athletes say their minds are on getting ready for competition. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not worried about any safety issues in Russia at this point,\u201d said Kelly Clark, a snowboarder competing in her fourth Winter Games. \u201cWe\u2019re so focused on our competition and on our sport.\u201d \n \n U.S. officials say the terror threat is higher than at any previous Olympics. The State Department will have diplomatic security officers in Sochi, though it has declined to say how many, and the FBI will have a presence as well. \n \n Evan Vucci / AP file President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin last June. \n \n \u201cThe Russian government has the lead here for security,\u201d Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve said we\u2019re happy to assist in any way we can, certainly for American citizens.\u201d \n \n President Barack Obama spoke with Putin this week about Olympic security, and Russia has raised the possibility of the Americans\u2019 sharing bomb-detecting technology for the games. That would mean having American military personnel on the ground to help. \n \n But senior defense officials told NBC News on Wednesday that there was little or no chance that the technology could be in place in time. It would take months to train the Russians, and there has been no discussion of using the system in Sochi under total American control, they said. \n \n And the Olympics take place at a time of frayed U.S.-Russian relations \u2014 tested by the Edward Snowden affair and the Boston Marathon bombings \u2014 not to mention the long shadow of the Cold War. \n \n A large-scale attack would trigger almost unimaginable complications, said Weiss, the Russia expert. \n \n For example: At least 85 countries and 2,500 athletes are taking part in the games. Sochi has a fairly small airport, so who gets to fly out first? And why should the Americans be given priority? \n \n \u201cSomething that looks like the U.S. cavalry riding to rescue Russia or Vladimir Putin from an attack seems \u2014 well, it\u2019s just hard to imagine that happening,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s all on Russia.\u201d \n \n Catherine Chomiak, Courtney Kube, Jim Miklaszewski, Andrea Mitchell and Michele Neubert of NBC News contributed to this report. \n \n Related: \n \n This story was originally published on ||||| A policeman standing guard Wednesday at the Rosa Khutor Park in the Krasnaya Polyana complex, which will be used for skiing at the upcoming games. | Reuters \n \n Amid heightened concerns about security at the upcoming Sochi Winter Games, Russia has introduced extensive safeguards that observers say are close to those imposed in a state of emergency. But some countries' teams will be providing their athletes with even more security, worrying that the level of danger in Sochi is higher than at any previous Olympics. \n \n Some 2,000 athletes will participate in the Games, and about 213,000 visitors are expected to come to Sochi, which borders Russia's turbulent North Caucasus republics. The Games will be held in the wake of two recent suicide bombings that killed 34 people in Volgograd, 700 kilometers north of Sochi. \n \n Many nations said that while they were concerned about the Volgograd attacks, they would primarily count on the Russian authorities to provide security during the Games. Part of the U.S. team, however, has hired a private security firm for its athletes, while the U.S. government has sent FBI agents to Sochi and Moscow for the duration of Games and made air and naval assets available to help Russia prevent possible terror attacks. \n \n Several groups have threatened to attack the Sochi Olympics, the latest being a group that calls itself Vilayat Dagestan, which also claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings. They said the attacks were ordered by rebel leader Doku Umarov, who has also threatened to strike Sochi during the Olympics. \n \n In response to the possible threats, the U.S. ski and snowboard team has hired private security firm Global Rescue to protect its athletes in case of emergency. Global Rescue head Daniel Richards said Sochi was a unique environment with challenges that his firm had not experienced at the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, in 2006 or Vancouver, Canada, in 2010, when its security agents also worked for the U.S. team. \n \n For the Sochi Games, the firm will have five aircraft on standby to assist the team in case an emergency requires an evacuation. Richards said it would be one of the firm's larger deployments for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association given the scale and the location. \"Our planning with them began months ago,\" he said by e-mail. \n \n Global Rescue is also providing athletes with guidelines to minimize the possibility that they would become targets and develop protocols and strategies they can use to deal with events that might occur while they are in Sochi. He said his firm's team would work with Russian state agencies as necessary. \n \n Britain has also said it will provide additional security to its Olympic team by sending security staff to Sochi as part of its delegation, but said the move is not related to last month's attacks in Volgograd. \n \n Alexander Demianchuk / Reuters A ski lift operating at a Sochi venue. \n \n \"We will rely primarily on the security provided by the Games Organizing Committee and the host country,\" the British Olympic Association said in a statement following the Volgograd bombings. \"As with previous Olympic Games, we will have security personnel as part of our delegation. That has been in our planning all along.\" \n \n The statement said that in the interests of secrecy, neither the exact number of security personnel nor where those individuals will be based would be disclosed. \n \n Russia's security services are taking what some observers say are unprecedented measures to provide sufficient protection from would-be attackers. \n \n Some 40,000 police officers will be used to provide security during the Olympics, and Russia's 58th Army unit, which is composed of about 70,000 soldiers, will patrol Russia's nearby southern border with Georgia. \n \n By comparison, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, some 13,000 police officers and 17,000 soldiers were used for security. \n \n \"Security is to be ensured by some 40,000 law enforcement and special services officers,\" President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with foreign media on Sunday. \"We will protect our air and sea space, as well as the mountain cluster. I hope things will be organized in such a way that they do not catch the eye and will not, so to say, depress the participants in the Olympic Games.\" \n \n Some nations, even those that have experienced tragedy at past Olympics, say that they consider these measures sufficient and that they will not be sending additional security for their teams. \n \n Israel, which saw 11 of its Olympic team members taken hostage and later killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, is among them. Vladimir Shklyar, head of the Israeli delegation to the Sochi Olympics, said by phone that Israel was confident that Russian security agencies would do their job properly and that the Games would be safe. \n \n A spokesman for the German Olympic Sports Federation said Germany also trusted Russian authorities to provide excellent security in Sochi. \"But we will look closely with our German national security authorities on the situation in Sochi, because in the modern world you can never be 100 percent confident that there will be no emergency situations,\" he said. \n \n The spokesman said he could not reveal whether German security officials would be a part of the German delegation or would observe the situation from Germany. When asked whether the team would use the services of a private security firm like Global Rescue, he said: \"We will have no aircraft, that is all that I can say.\" \n \n A representative for the Dutch Olympic Committee said he could not comment on whether the Netherlands would take any additional security measures but said: \"We take security seriously, just like the authorities in Sochi.\" \n \n From Sweden, only one special pair could demand a security detail \u2014 and it is not the star athletes from their cross-country skiing squad. \n \n \"We rely on the host country's authorities \u2014 only the king and queen can get additional security personnel,\" said a spokesman for the Swedish Olympic Committee.",

    "document": "At a time when store closures are accelerating and struggling malls pockmark the country, county commissioners in Florida have approved a plan to build what would be the largest mall in the U.S. \n \n American Dream Miami would also be the most expensive mall ever built, according to Canadian developer Triple Five Worldwide Group of Cos. The 6.2-million-square-foot retail and entertainment complex would cost an estimated $4 billion, Triple Five says. \n \n ... ||||| A rendering of the American Dream Mall in Miami, Florida. Triple Five Group \n \n The largest mall in the US \u2014 called the American Dream \u2014 is officially coming to Miami, Florida. \n \n Spanning 6 million square feet, the $4 billion retail and entertainment complex will be about twice the size of the nation's current largest mall, the King of Prussia Mall in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. \n \n The American Dream Miami's developers, Triple Five Group, are also behind the Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota, according to The Miami Herald. \n \n Set to be located on undeveloped land off the Florida Turnpike, the American Dream Miami will look more like an amusement park than a traditional, dumbbell-shaped mall. The complex will feature a water park with a giant indoor pool, an indoor ice rink, an artificial ski slope, \"submarine\" rides, dozens of restaurants, and up to 1,200 stores. \n \n The project doesn't have a set timeline yet. A rendering of the water park at the American Dream Mall in Miami, Florida. Triple Five Group Triple Five anticipates that 30 million people will visit the property each year. That's about 10 million fewer visitors than the Mall of America, which generates nearly $2 billion annually for Minnesota, according to the developers. \n \n The new project has received some pushback. A number of existing malls in Miami argue that the city, which already has a saturated retail market, doesn't need another mall (especially of this scale). \n \n Some Miami locals also have concerns regarding the development's potential water and energy use and impact on the city's stormwater system. During a meeting of the Miami-Dade County Commission on May 17, Miami resident Megan Sorbo called the project \"an environmental abomination,\" according to the Herald. Environmentalists from the Sierra Club noted that the mega-mall will be in a low-lying area of Miami, putting the development at greater risk of flooding as well. \n \n While Triple Five has received approval from the city, it still needs a series of permits, additional financing, and a proposal for stormwater runoff infrastructure. Triple Five Group As the American Dream Miami moves forward, hundreds of malls and thousands of mall-based stores \u2014 from Claire's to Sears\u2014 have closed in the past two decades across the US. According to retail analysts, many more may close within the next 10 years, due largely to the rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits. \n \n Miami's new complex could provide a more viable model for struggling malls and malls of the future. Unlike traditional suburban centers, the American Dream Miami focuses on experiential attractions, with the water park and ice rink to reside in the atrium. The project fits into the genre of \"destination malls,\" which are often located near urban centers and attract visitors from the entire region rather than only people who live nearby. \n \n A rendering of the indoor ice rink at the American Dream Mall in Miami, Florida. Triple Five Group Destination malls, also called \"super-regional malls\" or \"lifestyle centers,\" use experiential attractions to subsidize regular retail shops. They usually include attractions like movie theaters, bars, casinos, restaurants, rock climbing walls, laser tag, and even roller coasters. \n \n In a previous interview with Business Insider, David Smiley, the assistant director of Columbia University's Urban Design graduate program, said that destination malls can be more profitable to developers than normal malls. \n \n \"The emergence of entertainment as part of the shopping mall is becoming very important,\" he said. \"It keeps people in the center longer. And even if they weren't going to shop for something, they get lured in.\" \n \n A rendering of the indoor ski area at the American Dream Mall in Miami, Florida. Triple Five Group For example, in 2012 and 2013, the Carousel Center in Syracuse, New York re-branded as Destiny USA, and added higher-end restaurants, IMAX screens, an arcade, and indoor go-carting and obstacle courses. According to the mall, the 2.4-million-square-foot complex draws around 29 million people (both from the US and Canada) every year. \n \n Triple Five is working on another destination mall in New Jersey, too. The complex, called American Dream Meadowlands, will include a Nickelodeon theme park (similar to the one at the Mall of America). It's set to open in 2019. ||||| Hey, kids, you know what America really needs? Another shopping mall. \n \n But not just any shopping mall. What it really needs is a big \u2013 no, make that obscenely gargantuan \u2013 place with millions of square feet of retail and entertainment space. How about a hotel? A water park? Indoor skiing? And maybe a couple of thousand hotel rooms just to fill out the empty spaces? \n \n If you think you\u2019re suddenly stuck in a time warp and this is a story from 2002 that has somehow made it into your news feed, check the time stamp: This baby is so right now, it\u2019s downright frightening. \n \n This week, the Miami-Dade County Commission approved zoning changes that will allow American Dream Miami to be built on a 174-acre site within the county. \n \n And who better to build it than those zany Ghermezian boys and their Triple Five Worldwide Group out of Canada? \n \n For those of you not familiar with the history of shopping complexes the size of Asian city-states, the Ghermezian family first rose to fame building the West Edmonton Mall in Canada more than 35 years ago. At the time, it was truly something that had never existed before in the history of retailing: an immense complex of stores, restaurants, an amusement park, water features and enough food courts to feed an entire nation. It remains the biggest shopping anything in the world. \n \n The family next took its formula south of the border and built a slightly smaller version in Minneapolis and dubbed it the Mall of America. Four people who attended the grand opening in 1992 are still wandering the halls looking for the exit to the parking lot. \n \n The success of the Mall of America set off a retail feeding frenzy, the after-effects of which the industry is still reeling from today. The Mills Corporation, which had made its name with outlet-based centers, decided it could go store-to-store with those Canadians and broke ground on a massive mall just west of New York City in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Dubbed the Great American Mall, it, too, would have the requisite store-restaurant-ski-extravaganza mix housed in a building that appeared to be paneled with leftover color tiles. \n \n In a relatively short period of time, it all went downhill, as if on a literal ski slope. Mills ran out of money, and eventually out of corporate existence. Another developer came in, renamed the festering structure Xanadu and proclaimed it the next great thing in retailing. Apparently the urban legend that the New Jersey Meadowlands is where people go to bury things they don\u2019t want found (remember Jimmy Hoffa?) didn\u2019t resonate with this builder, either, and he likewise hung up his earth-movers after a few years. \n \n Enter \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the Ghermezians, who convinced Chris Christie, then New Jersey's governor, that they were just the guys to finally get the job done. They took over in 2011 and said the mall \u2013 now called American Dream Meadowlands \u2013 would be open in time for the Super Bowl being played next door at the new Meadowlands Stadium \u2026 in 2014. \n \n If you attended that game \u2013 or any of the hundreds of other football games, soccer matches, rock concerts or rodeos held at Meadowlands Stadium since then \u2013 you\u2019ve no doubt seen the mall next store in various stages of inactivity, construction cranes hovering over the site like vultures waiting to pick at the rotting debris. \n \n But on any given day, some work is actually occurring at the mall, and those ever-hopeful Ghermezians now say it will open next year. That could still be as long as 19 months from now \u2013 and 16 years from when construction began. Even Tesla builds faster than that. \n \n Which brings us back to Miami and this latest venture. The publicity mentions all the usual buzzwords about jobs and the local tourist-based economy being able to absorb a facility like this. No local businesses will suffer, of course, and \u2013 let\u2019s be clear \u2013 not a penny of public funding will be used to build American Dream Miami. \n \n The last major shopping mall to be built in the U.S. was the Mall at University Town Center \u2013 also in Florida, by the way \u2013 and that opened last June. Before that, it had been three years since what the trade calls a regional shopping mall had been built. \n \n According to estimates, there are still about 1,200 shopping malls in the country, but if current trends continue, that number could be cut in half by the time things level off. \n \n When Mall of America was built, there was no such thing as e-commerce. When plans were drawn up for the mall in New Jersey, Amazon had been in business for only a few years \u2013 and was still basically just selling books and a few CDs. So you can cut developers some slack for the situations they find themselves in today. \n \n But c\u2019mon, Ghermezians. America is over-stored, over-shopped and over-bought. We don\u2019t go to movies like we used to, and there\u2019s an Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory at every retail crossroads in the country. And does anybody really need to go snow skiing in Florida? \n \n The business of building retailing in North America was a wonderful one, and it had an insanely good run \u2013 until it stopped. One man\u2019s dream is another\u2019s nightmare. ||||| By Allison Pries | NJ Advance Media \n \n If you've lived in, been to, driven by, or flown over New Jersey anytime this century, you've heard of it. The American Dream mall -- the artist formerly known as Xanadu. Over the last 16 years, it has often become the punchline, as money problems and lawsuits plagued the mega development. \n \n But, for those still wishing that the mega-mall may one day actually open its doors, the last few years have brought renewed hope. The mall's current developer, Triple Five (the third to take on the project since its inception) seems to be maintaining momentum on its American Dream. \n \n Construction is actually happening, and Triple Five promises most of the complex will open in the spring of 2019. The target date has intrigued many, who have watched the dramatic (and expensive) saga of the development unfold.",

Critics are also wary of the public subsidies that might be used to open the mall, slated to be the most expensive ever built, but American Dream Miami plans to \"be built by private dollars,\" a lawyer for Triple Five says. Countering what he calls \"a campaign of disinformation\" by local mall owners, he adds the mall will create 25,000 jobs and attract 30 million tourists annually.",

Russia must balance a range of factors in seeking to determine Mr Snowden's fate - the risk of a serious rift with Washington and Russia's own standing as an international actor that upholds the legal order must be set against the strong vein of sympathy for Mr Snowden amongst Russian public opinion. \n \n US Secretary of State John Kerry raised Mr Snowden's case in talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Brunei. \n \n But Mr Kerry said the two did not discuss the matter substantively. \n \n \"I did raise the issue of Mr Snowden but that is not his portfolio, nor is it mine, but it is being handled within the justice department,\" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. \n \n 'Not an agent' \n \n The Wikileaks press release said that most of the asylum requests - including to Russia itself - were handed to the Russian consulate at Sheremetyevo airport late on Sunday for delivery to the relevant embassies in Moscow. \n \n The requests were submitted by Sarah Harrison, a British member of the Wikileaks legal team acting as Mr Snowden's representative, the statement added. \n \n But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said Mr Snowden withdrew the application to Russia because Moscow had said he should give up \"anti-American activity\". \n \n \"After learning of Russia's position yesterday, voiced by President Putin ... he abandoned his intention [of staying] and his request to be able to stay in Russia,\" he said. \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin had said that while Moscow \"never hands over anybody anywhere\", Mr Snowden could only stay on condition that he stopped damaging Russia's \"American partners\" with his leaks. \n \n Mr Snowden has reportedly been in the transit area of Sheremetyevo since arriving there from Hong Kong on 23 June. \n \n Mr Peskov confirmed he was still there and had not crossed into Russian territory, adding that the former analyst had never been a Russian agent and had never worked with its intelligence services. \n \n Norway, Poland, Germany, Austria, Finland, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland said asylum requests could only be made on their soil. \n \n Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who is on a visit to Moscow, said Caracas had not yet received an asylum application from Mr Snowden but that he had \"done something very important for humanity\" and \"deserved the world's protection\". \n \n \"The world's conscience should react, the world youth should react, the decent people who want a peaceful world should react, everyone should react and find solidarity with this young man who has denounced and altered the world that they [the US] pretend to control.\" \n \n Mr Snowden had previously submitted an application to Ecuador, whose embassy in London is sheltering Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and to Iceland. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vladimir Putin: \"He should cease his work aimed at damaging our American partners\" \n \n Ecuador's President Rafael Correa told the Agence France-Presse news agency on Monday that his country would process Mr Snowden's asylum request if he managed to enter an Ecuadorean embassy. \n \n However, if he can complete his asylum request on Russian territory , then \"the situation can be processed and resolved there,\" President Correa added. \n \n Details have also emerged of a letter from Mr Snowden to President Correa, thanking Ecuador for guaranteeing \"my rights would be protected upon departing Hong Kong - I could never have risked travel without that\". \n \n 'Stateless person' \n \n Speaking in Tanzania on Monday, President Barack Obama said Moscow and Washington had held \"high level discussions\" about Mr Snowden, who he said had travelled to Moscow without valid documents. \n \n Mr Snowden describes himself as \"a stateless person\", accusing the US government of stopping him from exercising the \"basic right...to seek asylum\". \n \n \"The president ordered his vice president to pressure the leaders of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions,\" he is quoted by Wikileaks as saying. \n \n \"This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.\" \n \n The leaking of thousands of classified intelligence documents has led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data. ||||| NSA leaker Edward Snowden's attempts to seek refuge outside the United States hit hurdles Tuesday, after Russian media reported he canceled his asylum bid in Russia and several European countries said such applications wouldn't be considered if they were made from abroad. \n \n FILE - This June 23, 2013 file photo shows a TV screen shows a news report of Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee who leaked top-secret documents about sweeping U.S. surveillance programs, at a shopping...

The letter could not be independently authenticated as being from... (Associated Press) \n \n Russian news agencies Tuesday quoted President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Snowden withdrew his request when he learnt about the terms Moscow has set out. Putin said on Monday that Russia is ready to shelter Snowden as long as he stops leaking U.S. secrets. \n \n At the same time, Putin said he had no plans to turn over Snowden to the United States. \n \n Meanwhile several of the other countries where the WikiLeaks says Snowden has applied for asylum have said he cannot apply from abroad. Officials in Germany, Norway, Austria, Poland, Finland and Switzerland all said he must make his request on their soil. \n \n WikiLeaks said requests have also been made to Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Iceland, India, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Spain and Venezuela. \n \n The asylum requests reported by WikiLeaks and the Snowden statement could not be independently authenticated. \n \n WikiLeaks also posted a statement attributed to Snowden on its website late Monday, in which he slams President Barack Obama for \"using citizenship as a weapon.\" \n \n \"Although I am convicted of nothing, (the United States) has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person,\" Snowden says in the statement. \"Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum. \n \n \"Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.\" \n \n Snowden, who has been on the run since releasing sensitive NSA documents, is believed to have been in Moscow airport's transit zone since his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23. \n \n WikiLeaks legal adviser Sarah Harrison delivered the requests for asylum to an official at the Russian consulate at the Moscow airport on Sunday, according to the group that has adopted Snowden and his cause. \n \n The U.S. has annulled Snowden's passport, and Ecuador, where he had initially hoped to get asylum, has been giving mixed signals about offering him shelter. \n \n The expanded requests for asylum come as the Obama administration contends with European allies angry about the release of documents that alleged U.S. eavesdropping on European Union diplomats. \n \n Obama said Monday that the U.S. would provide allies with information about new reports that the NSA had bugged EU offices in Washington, New York and Brussels. But he also suggested such activity by governments would hardly be unusual. ||||| Ecuador is not considering Edward Snowden's asylum request and never intended to facilitate his flight from Hong Kong, president Rafael Correa said, as the whistleblower made a personal plea to Quito for his case to be heard. \n \n Snowden was Russia's responsibility and would have to reach Ecuadorean territory before the country would consider any asylum request, the president said in an interview with the Guardian on Monday. \n \n \"Are we responsible for getting him to Ecuador? It's not logical. The country that has to give him a safe conduct document is Russia.\" \n \n The president, speaking at the presidential palace in Quito, said his government did not intentionally help Snowden travel from Hong Kong to Moscow with a temporary travel pass. The Ecuadorean consul in London acted without authority from Quito, he said. \n \n Asked if he thought the former NSA contractor would ever make it to \n \n Quito, he replied: \"Mr Snowden's situation is very complicated, but in \n \n this moment he is in Russian territory and these are decisions for the \n \n Russian authorities.\" \n \n On whether Correa would like to meet him, the president said: \"Not \n \n particularly. It's a complicated situation. Strictly speaking, Mr \n \n Snowden spied for some time.\" \n \n The comments contrasted with expressions of gratitude the 30-year-old fugitive issued hours later, before Correa's views had been published. \n \n \"I must express my deep respect for your principles and sincere thanks for your government's action in considering my request for political asylum,\" Snowden said, according to a letter written in Spanish and obtained by the Press Association news agency, based in London. \n \n \"There are few world leaders who would risk standing for the human rights of an individual against the most powerful government on earth, and the bravery of Ecuador and its people is an example to the world.\" \n \n Snowden compared the silence of governments afraid of US retaliation with Ecuador's help in his flight to Moscow on 22 June. A temporary Ecuadorean travel document substituted for his cancelled US passport. \n \n \"The decisive action of your consul in London, Fidel Narvaez, guaranteed my rights would be protected upon departing Hong Kong \u2013 I could never have risked travel without that. Now, as a result, and through the continued support of your government, I remain free and able to publish information that serves the public interest.\" \n \n The letter will boost Ecuador's reputation with Snowden's supporters but sat awkwardly with the president's attempt to distance Quito from the saga. Correa said Quito respected the right of asylum and appreciated Snowden exposing the extent of US spying, but would not consider an asylum request unless he made it to an Ecuadorean embassy or the country itself \u2013 a remote possibility while he remains reportedly marooned in Sheremetyevo airport's transit lounge. \"He must be on Ecuadorean territory,\" the president said. \n \n Earlier on Monday, Moscow confirmed that Snowden had applied for asylum in Russia. The Los Angeles Times said he had made similar applications to a total of 15 countries. In another statement, issued through by the campaigning website Wikileaks, Snowden attacked President Obama for putting pressure behind the scenes on countries to which he had petitioned for asylum. \n \n In his Guardian interview, Correa said his government had not, and would not, give Snowden an authorised travel document to extract himself from Moscow airport. \"The right of asylum request is one thing but helping someone travel from one country to another \u2014 Ecuador has never done this. \" \n \n He said the temporary travel document issued by his London consul on 22 June \u2013 and publicly disowned five days later \u2013 was issued without official authorisation. \"There is a mistake \u2026 Look, this crisis hit us in a very vulnerable moment. Our foreign minister was on a 15-day tour. He was in Vietnam. Our deputy foreign minister was in the Czech Republic. Our US ambassador was in Italy.\" \n \n Narvaez and the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sheltered at Ecuador's London embassy for the past year to escape extradition, took matters into their own hands because they feared Snowden risked capture, Correa said. \n \n \"The consul, in his desperation, probably he couldn't reach the foreign minister \u2026 and he issued a safe conduct document without validity, without authorisation, without us even knowing.\" \n \n Correa said the consul was a \"cultured\" man who cited the example of Ecuadorean diplomats in Czechoslovakia giving Jews visas in defiance of their foreign ministry during the second world war. \n \n \"Look, he [Assange] is in the embassy, he's a friend of the consul, and he calls him at four in the morning to say they are going to capture Snowden. The [consul] is desperate \u2013 'how are we going to save the life of this man?' \u2013 and does it. \n \n \"So I told him: OK, if you think you did the right thing, I respect your decision, but you could not give, without authorisation, that safe conduct pass. It was completely invalid, and he will have to accept the consequences.\" \n \n Narvaez would be \"sanctioned\", the president said, without elaborating. \n \n Some Ecuadorean diplomats have complained that Assange appeared to usurp Quito but the president said there was no rupture. \"Mr Assange continues to enjoy our total respect and is under the protection of the Ecuadorean state.\" \n \n Correa, a standard bearer for the left in Latin America, has joined European and other Latin Americans leaders in denouncing US espionage. \n \n However, he softened his tone over the weekend and praised the US vice-president, Joe Biden, for a gracious phone call, saying he would consider Washington's request to refuse any asylum claim from Snowden while retaining Ecuador's sovereignty. \n \n \u2022 The headline on this article was changed on 3 July 2013 to give a more accurate reflection of the substance of the interview with President Correa. After a review of the original Spanish transcript on 4 July 2013, a quote in which president Correa described the \"mistake\" surrounding the issuing of Snowden's travel document in Hong Kong was translated more precisely and a reference to Snowden as a complicated person was changed to refer to his circumstances. ||||| Tor \n \n Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to. \n \n In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. \n \n Tails \n \n If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called Tails.

    "document": "The taste of beer, without its alcoholic effects, may be enough to trigger the release of the pleasure chemical dopamine in the brain, a study finds. \n \n To see how the taste of beer affects the brain, researchers gave a group of men tiny tastes of beer, and as the men sipped the beer, the researchers scanned the men\u2019s brains. After a taste of beer, the men's brains showed a notable release of dopamine, a brain chemical associated with the pleasurable experience of consuming alcohol and other drugs. The effect was even greater among men who had a family history of alcoholism. \n \n The findings are not surprising, scientists say, but having a way to assess predisposition to alcohol abuse could be useful. \n \n \"We believe this is the first experiment in humans to show that the taste of an alcoholic drink alone, without any intoxicating effect from the alcohol, can elicit this dopamine activity in the brain's reward centers,\" the study's senior author, neuroscientist David Kareken of the Indiana University School of Medicine, said in a statement. The findings were detailed online today (April 15) in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. \n \n Dopamine, a brain chemical widely associated with pleasure, has long been linked to the consumption of alcohol and other drugs. Sensory cues \u2014 such as tastes, smells or the sight of a bar \u2014 can elicit cravings to drink and cause relapses in recovering alcoholics. Dopamine may be critically involved in such cravings, scientists believe. [11 Interesting Facts About Hangovers] \n \n In the study, researchers gave 49 male volunteers a tiny taste (half an ounce, or 15 milliliters) of their favorite beer over the course of 15 minutes \u2014 enough to taste the beer but not enough to cause a change in blood-alcohol level or intoxication. At other times, the volunteers were given a sports drink or water, for comparison. \n \n To study the effect of beer's taste on dopamine receptors, the researchers scanned the volunteers' brains using Positron Emission Tomography, which uses the radiation emitted by a radioactive chemical to produce a 3D image of the brain. \n \n The scans revealed higher increases in dopamine after the men tasted beer compared with tasting the sports drink or water \u2014 suggesting that the taste of alcohol is enough to prompt a pleasurable response in the brain. The men also reported higher beer cravings after tasting beer than water or the sports drink. \n \n Furthermore, the men who had a family history of alcoholism showed an even greater spike in dopamine levels after they tasted the beer, so the dopamine response may be a heritable risk factor for alcoholism. \n \n \"This paper demonstrates that taste alone impacts on the brain functions associated with desire,\" Peter Anderson, a professor of substance use, policy and practice at Newcastle University, U.K., said in a statement. But Anderson noted that \u201cWith regard to the family history effect, this is quite difficult to assess and know what it means so we can\u2019t be too sure of an effect or how strong it might be.\" \n \n The effects of the alcohol itself on the brain, and not just the taste, could not be ruled out, Anderson added. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitter and Google+.

If not, perhaps it\u2019s just as well, because scientists say that even the taste of beer (without the intoxicating effects of alcohol) can trigger that flow of striatal dopamine in the brain. \n \n The findings, published online Monday in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, \"demonstrate for the first time the important role of an alcoholic drink's flavor, absent alcohol\u2019s pharmacological effects,\" the study authors wrote. \n \n Researchers from the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis asked 49 men to try two beverages: Gatorade and their preferred beer. They sipped a mere 15 milliliters over 15 minutes, which allowed them to experience the taste of both without getting even close to buzzed by the beer\u2019s alcohol content. \n \n The scientists scanned the men\u2019s brains during this demure drinking game using positron emission tomography, looking for signs of dopamine release. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with alcohol and other drugs. They found that the dopamine levels rose much higher when the participants tasted their beers, compared with when they just drank the Gatorade. The effect was more pronounced in participants who had a family history of alcoholism. \n \n The findings suggest that the jacking-up of dopamine levels in response to alcohol-related triggers could be a hereditary risk factor for alcoholism. \n \n This effect persisted even though many of the participants actually said that the Gatorade tasted better than the beer. \n \n Follow me on Twitter @aminawrite.",

    "document": "\n \n Share this post \n \n BILLINGS, Mont. (CN) \u2013 In the picturesque mountains near the nation\u2019s first national park, a small water and sewer district is taking on the National Park Service in a dispute over arsenic in wastewater coming from Yellowstone National Park that\u2019s treated by the sewer district. \n \n In a lawsuit filed this week in federal court in Montana, the Gardiner Water and Sewer Treatment District says that for the past few years, they\u2019ve been trying to work with the National Park Service to resolve the matter before the district takes on an estimated $2 million sludge treatment pond replacement as part of its routine maintenance. But with no timely response from the Park Service, and under pressure from the state to replace the ponds, the district said it had no choice but to sue. \n \n \u201cGiven that the district has been directed by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to dispose of the sludge and replace the liners in its treatment ponds and cannot await the Park Service\u2019s responses any longer, it has been compelled to file suit,\u201d the district said in its lawsuit. The district\u2019s attorney Todd Shea didn\u2019t return a telephone call seeking additional information. \n \n Arsenic can occur naturally in geothermal areas, and it\u2019s not uncommon for it to be detected in Montana\u2019s water. In February 2015, the district\u2019s engineer reported high levels of arsenic in sewage coming from the town of Mammoth, which is home to park employees and sits just inside Yellowstone\u2019s northern border. The engineer noted that it wasn\u2019t coming from the park\u2019s wastewater, but appeared to be flowing into the system from manholes or holes in underground pipes. It needed to be addressed since the Yellowstone wastewater was contributing 95 percent of the arsenic to the treatment system. \n \n \u201cThe engineer recommended that the district address this infiltration problem with the park prior to beginning any sludge removal project,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cOtherwise, the high level of arsenic in the district\u2019s sewage treatment plant would return after the sludge removal project.\u201d \n \n The engineer also stated the arsenic levels comply with federal drinking water standards in both the town of Gardiner, at Yellowstone\u2019s northern entrance, and in the park itself. \n \n In March 2015, the district wrote a letter to the Park Service, asking the agency to locate and repair the areas of infiltration since the district couldn\u2019t move forward until the problem was addressed. When the Park Service didn\u2019t respond, the district sent a second letter in December 2015 noting that the arsenic levels had increased since the March letter. \n \n Yellowstone\u2019s press representative is out of the office until January. But the lawsuit states the Park Service acknowledged it was causing a problem and would \u201cmake a substantial contribution\u201d to the sludge removal project \u2013 but it didn\u2019t mention how it would address the leaking pipes. \n \n The district sent a third letter in August 2016 and received a written response from the Park Service confirming that the infiltration problems were accurate and ongoing, but that money for the project probably won\u2019t be available until 2020 at the earliest. \n \n The lawsuit claims the park breached an oral contract to help pay for the sludge pond replacement, and is trespassing since the damage caused by the arsenic is ongoing. The district also says Yellowstone National Park is creating a \u201cdanger to public safety\u201d by not addressing the arsenic. \n \n In addition to breach of contract and trespass claims, the district is suing for public and private nuisance and negligence. It wants a judge to order the park to address its arsenic problem, to monitor its sewer lines quarterly and provide the district with reports and to help pay for the sludge removal project. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Michael Wright daily! \n \n Your notification has been saved. \n \n There was a problem saving your notification. \n \n Whenever Michael Wright posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. \n \n Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

The march culminated with participants surrounding and attacking a much smaller group of counterprotesters who had circled a statue of Thomas Jefferson, the university\u2019s founder. \n \n The following day, Spencer and the others took part in the white-supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that led to violent clashes and the death of counterprotester Heather Heyer, who was run over by a car that police say was driven by a man with neo-Nazi ties. \n \n [Charlottesville timeline: Recounting a day of rage, hate, violence and death] \n \n \u201cThe trespass warnings issued today reflect our commitment to ensuring the safety of our community while upholding the principles of freedom of speech and assembly,\u201d U-Va. President Jim Ryan said in a statement. \n \n Spencer, in a written response to a request for comment, said: \u201cIdeas have no jurisdiction and ultimately can\u2019t be censored. That said, I have no immediate plans to engage in activism on campus, at U-Va. or anywhere.\u201d \n \n The university announcement of the no-trespass orders followed a year-long investigation by the U-Va. Police Department in coordination with state and federal law enforcement agencies that identified the 10 individuals as \u201ceither committing or conspiring with others to carry out acts of violence or other conduct that directly threatened the health and safety of members of the community and other people on Grounds,\u201d Assistant Vice President and Chief of Police Tommye S. Sutton said in a statement. \u201cWe have drawn a distinction between free speech and conduct that is aimed to intimidate others and promote violence. Such conduct and intimidation will not be tolerated.\u201d \n \n A violation of the no-trespass order is a criminal trespass offense and violators would be subject to arrest. According to university policy, trespass warnings expire four years after the date the warning is served. \n \n In an interview, Timothy J. Heaphy, U-Va. counsel, reiterated that the decision to ban the men was because they violated policies of conduct, not speech. \n \n \u201cIf you cross the line from offensive speech to take action, that goes over the line of protected expression,\u201d Heaphy said. \n \n Heaphy said he hopes to identify more individuals who took part in the march who acted in violation of university policy and add them to the list of banned individuals. Jason Kessler, another organizer of the Unite the Right rally and a U-Va. graduate, was issued a trespass warning in April. \n \n Walter Heinecke, a U-Va. associate professor who rushed to help students injured by the white supremacist marchers, called the university\u2019s decision to ban Spencer and the others \u201ca highly appropriate move.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs someone who was at the Rotunda on Aug. 11, I feel grateful the university is finally taking some responsibility and action,\u201d Heinecke said in an interview. \u201cTo hear that they\u2019re banning Spencer and Kessler and the others is a positive sign to me that the university is taking seriously its obligation to address white supremacy.\u201d \n \n The university said it was prohibiting Spencer because of his role in organizing the torchlight march and for giving a speech at the statue \u201cin which he took credit for \u2018occupying space\u2019 and \u2018defeating\u2019 counter protesters that evening.\u201d In its statement, the university said Spencer\u2019s \u201cwords and actions at and after the rally provide evidence of his involvement in a conspiracy to commit acts of violence at the Jefferson statue.\u201d \n \n Earlier this week, Spencer was accused by his wife, Nina Koupriianova, of physical, verbal and emotional abuse during their eight-year marriage, according to documents filed as part of their divorce proceedings. Koupriianova submitted emails, text conversations and photographs in a court brief as evidence of her allegations. \n \n Spencer disputed Koupriianova\u2019s charges in an affidavit. \u201cMore importantly, none of the allegations of \u2018abuse\u2019 have anything to do with my children,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy interactions with my children have only been healthy . . . Petitioner\u2019s behaviors reveal that she simply wants to \u2018score points.\u2019 \u201d \n \n [White nationalist Richard Spencer accused of physically abusing wife throughout their marriage] \n \n In addition to Spencer, the university identified those who were banned as Benjamin Daley of Redondo Beach, Calif.; Antonio Foreman of Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Thomas Gillen of Redondo Beach, Calif.; Elliott Kline of Reading, Pa.; Michael Miselis of Lawndale, Calif.; Vasillious Pistolis of Charlotte; Robert Ray of Frankston, Tex.;, Wil Smith of Nocona, Tex.; and Cole White of Clayton, Calif. Efforts to reach them were unsuccessful. \n \n Four of the men banned Friday \u2014 Daley, Miselis, Gillen and White \u2014 were arrested by federal agents earlier this month and charged with violating federal laws against rioting for their alleged actions in the Unite the Right rally. Pistolis was dismissed from the Marines this summer after being tried at a court-martial and found guilty.",

    "document": "Sen. Marco Rubio, the leading Republican behind the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill, says he will not vote for the legislation he helped write and has staked his political future on, unless substantial changes are made before final Senate consideration. \n \n Speaking with radio host Hugh Hewitt Tuesday, Rubio said the Senate should \u201cstrengthen the border security parts of this bill so that they\u2019re stronger, so that they don\u2019t give overwhelming discretion to the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d He said he was working with other senators on amendments to do just that. \n \n Then Hewitt asked: \u201cIf those amendments don\u2019t pass, will you yourself support the bill that emerged from Judiciary, Senator Rubio?\u201d \n \n Rubio answered, \u201cWell, I think if those amendments don\u2019t pass, then I think we\u2019ve got a bill that isn\u2019t going to become law, and I think we\u2019re wasting our time. So the answer is no.\u201d \n \n More from the Washington Examiner Benghazi bust Incremental advances \u2014 nuggets of information \u2014 don't make for dramatic hearings. \n \n Rubio\u2019s turning on his own bill would be an extraordinary turn of events. After playing a major role in drafting the legislation, Rubio has been its public face since then, making countless appearances on television, radio, and in print to gather support for the legislation. What has changed that would mean he would not vote for his own bill? If anything, the security measures in the bill were slightly strengthened in the Senate Judiciary Committee; the bill\u2019s original intention to apply new security provisions only to \u201chigh-risk\u201d sectors of the U.S.-Mexico border was expanded to apply to all sectors. \n \n So it would be hard to argue that the Judiciary Committee changed the bill in ways that would make it unacceptable to Rubio. But now he says he will vote against the bill approved by the committee, unless major changes are made. It is hard to tell if Rubio really disagrees with the substance of the legislation approved by the committee \u2014 he suggested to Hewitt that he would vote against the bill because it wouldn\u2019t pass without the changes, not because he objected to particular passages in the bill \u2014 but the result would be that the principal author of comprehensive immigration reform would vote against it in the Senate ||||| HH: I begin with United States Senator Marco Rubio from the great state of Florida. Senator, welcome back, it\u2019s good to speak with you. \n \n MR: Hugh, thanks for having me back. \n \n HH: Earlier today on Fox, you told the audience that there aren\u2019t 60 votes in the Senate for immigration reform. That\u2019s big news. The second news, though, is are you going to offer amendments that you think will gather in enough votes? \n \n MR: Well, let me first say that the news of what I said today on Fox about there not being the 60 votes, actually, Senator Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat, said the same thing last week. And that\u2019s a fact. And the reason why is because while there\u2019s a group, well, the majority of our colleagues are prepared to do immigration reform, they\u2019re only prepared to do it if we ensure that this illegal immigration problem never happens again. And so there\u2019s a handful of Democrats, and a sizeable number of Republicans that are saying to us we\u2019re prepared to do immigration reform, but we have to make sure there isn\u2019t another wave of illegal immigration. So for those who want immigration reform, the task is very simple. Let\u2019s strengthen the border security parts of this bill so that they\u2019re stronger, so that they don\u2019t give overwhelming discretion to the Department of Homeland Security, and I think if we can do that, then you\u2019re going to be able to get something done. But if you can\u2019t, it\u2019s not going to happen. \n \n HH: And will you be the author of those amendments? \n \n MR: We\u2019re working on it right now. A lot of other\u2026I\u2019ll be involved in it for sure. I think there are other senators that have taken the lead, and I\u2019ll let them kind of come out in the next couple of days with their specific ideas. But we\u2019ve been involved on a daily basis working with them to get to the right point in terms of real measures. And what we\u2019ve heard is people don\u2019t want to just turn it over to the Department of Homeland Security to come up with a plan. They want the plan to be laid out specifically with real measurable, and I think that that\u2019s a good approach. And so we\u2019re working with members now to do that. And we expect to hear from them here in the next couple of days. \n \n HH: If those amendments don\u2019t pass, will you yourself support the bill that emerged from Judiciary, Senator Rubio? \n \n MR: Well, I think if those amendments don\u2019t pass, then I think we\u2019ve got a bill that isn\u2019t going to become law, and I think we\u2019re wasting our time. So the answer is no. If they don\u2019t pass, then we\u2019ve got to keep working to ensure that we get to a bill that can become a law. We\u2019re not interested in passing a Senate bill. We\u2019re interested in passing a law that reforms a broken legal immigration system, that begins to enforce the law, and that deals with the 11 million people who are here illegally. And that\u2019s the goal of this endeavor. And so if those amendments fail, we\u2019ve got to go back to the drawing board and keep working until we can figure out one that will pass. But I don\u2019t understand why anyone would be against it, as such, I don\u2019t think there is a good reason to be against strengthening border security for our country. \n \n HH: Now Senator, the timing of this matter is a lot\u2026Senator Schumer said that he wants to be done by July 4 in the Senate. Is that a reasonable timetable? Do you expect that to hold? \n \n MR: Well, that\u2019s three full weeks, and that may be enough, it may not be. We don\u2019t know. I think what I\u2019m hoping, and I\u2019m expecting, and it\u2019s always been a condition of our support, has been an open process and extensive process where all viewpoints are heard, where serious amendments can be offered and debated and discussed. And that\u2019s what we were pleased to see during the Judiciary Committee process, and that\u2019s what we expect to see on the floor. So we might be able to do it in three weeks, it might take a little longer. I don\u2019t think that we should set an arbitrary date in terms of when we want to see it done. I mean, I don\u2019t think we need to unnecessarily delay it, but I think really, what we should be working on is getting it right, not getting it fast. \n \n HH: Now that means the next three weeks are incredibly important. There\u2019s a vacancy. You lost a colleague yesterday, Senator Frank Lautenberg, and I know that every member of the Senate always pauses to say appreciations about him. But Governor Christie has an appointment to make. When it comes to this immigration bill, it might be the most important three weeks of this interim senator\u2019s service in public life. What do you hope Governor Christie looks for, because he\u2019s now in the middle of the immigration debate? He\u2019s going to impact it. What do you want in a new colleague when it comes to this debate? \n \n MR: Well again, I just want someone who, I mean obviously, I\u2019d prefer it be a real conservative who can help us not just on this issue, but a bunch of other issues that we\u2019re facing. And obviously, it\u2019s his decision to make, and we\u2019ll see what he does with an interim appointment. I understand he\u2019s called for an election in October, and I know that New Jersey laws are complicated, but in the interim, I hope we\u2019ll get a strong conservative there that will help us here in Washington on a myriad of other issues that we\u2019re facing. As far as the immigration bill is concerned, you\u2019re right. I mean, this is very simple. It\u2019s pretty straightforward. If we can pass an amendment, if we can pass a measure that ensures that we will never again have a wave of illegal immigration, I believe that we will have immigration reform. And if we do not pass that, if that does not happen, I believe there will not be immigration reform. It\u2019s as straightforward as that. \n \n HH: Now Senator Rubio, I\u2019m in Arizona today, and I\u2019m going to talk to Governor Brewer, in fact, next hour, and in Arizona last week, there was a big story on the border fence, and it works. It works effectively, extraordinarily well. In fact, some people still try and climb over it, and they fall and they get terribly hurt. But most people turn back. And so the fence really works. Will the amendments that you think are coming include mandatory construction of fencing? Will they have the money and the authorization? And how much of it will there be? \n \n MR: Well, as far as how much is we\u2019re getting input from border patrol agents and others who are actually on the ground on a daily basis as to how much and where they should be. But I\u2019ve always believed that fencing is an important component of the plan, and I think that, but what we\u2019re trying to get to, ideally, is an amendment that dictates the number of fences, and also where they\u2019re located, in what sectors and so forth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards. Now you don\u2019t need fences on every part of the border. There are parts of the border where you\u2019re better off with manpower or something else. But we\u2019re going to take our cues from the people that are on the front lines. We\u2019ve been discussing this extensively with border patrol agents and their union about exactly what we need to be doing, and we continue to work with them. And then hopefully, we\u2019ll have an amendment soon that we can begin to discuss. \n \n HH: Now Senator, I think if it\u2019s a good enough deal, it\u2019s an offer that conservatives cannot refuse. And so if border security is really in this bill, and it\u2019s not discretionary, and we don\u2019t leave it up to Homeland Security, and it says it goes here, here and here, and it gets this high, and here\u2019s the money, and notwithstanding any other bill, all that good stuff, do you expect to win over conservative opponents of the bill based upon strengthened border security provisions? \n \n MR: Well look, I think there are some people that want, that are just opposed to anything that allows someone who has violated our immigration laws to ever become a U.S. citizen, no matter how many conditions you place on it. And I respect that view. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for our country to have millions of people here that can never become Americans, but we can have a respectful debate and a disagreement about that. I think there are other members that won\u2019t support it because they want to see the legalization first, I\u2019m sorry, they want to see the enforcement first and then the legalization afterwards. And that was initially how I thought about the issue as well. The problem with that is what do we do in the meantime? So if it takes three years to build all these fences, what do we do with the people that are illegally here for the next three years? Do we get engaged in a game of cat and mouse, where if you catch them, they\u2019re deported, but if you don\u2019t catch them, they get to stay? I think we\u2019re better off as a country figuring out who they are, running them through a background check and making them pay a fine, start making them pay taxes, and getting them incorporated into our economy. And then there are those, the vast majority of whom are prepared to support immigration reform the way we\u2019ve laid it out, but only if we can pass an amendment that ensures that we will never have another wave of illegal immigration again. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m really going to focus my energies, is on trying to get language into this bill that gets us that support. \n \n HH: Now Senator Rubio, if the bill is specific about the fence, and it has a timetable for getting it built, what will be the penalty, as you understand, it\u2019s obviously in draft and it\u2019s still being worked on, and it has to get through the Senate. If it passes, what will be the consequence if that fencing that\u2019s called for doesn\u2019t get built? \n \n MR: Well, the consequence would be that the green card process doesn\u2019t begin. That\u2019s what they call the trigger. And that\u2019s already in the bill now. In essence, it says that if the e-verify is not in place, if the entry/exit system is not in place, then the green card process does not begin. This would go, obviously, and it also says that if these plans are not fully implemented, the plans that the current bill asks the Department of Homeland Security to create, if those plans are not in place, the trigger is not met. Obviously now, if you actually lay out what the plan is, well, then those specific things would have to happen as well. So but the answer to your question is the green card process does not exist. Those folks who are here on a temporary status would have to remain in that temporary status until those things are accomplished. \n \n HH: And so if these additional amendments get passed, they will provide that that path to citizenship, which is, well, 15 or 20 years now, is not going to get, the clock is not going to start on that unless and until these things get done. Am I understanding it correctly? \n \n MR: And that\u2019s actually how the bill\u2019s largely structured now. The only difference is that right now, what it requires is for the plan that the Department of Homeland Security comes up with, for that plan to be fully implemented, or substantially implemented. What we\u2019re going to be doing now is instead of saying the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s plan, it would have to be the plan that Congress mandates in the bill would have to be substantially completed. So we\u2019d actually know what the plan is on the front end, but wouldn\u2019t have to wait for them to produce one and hope that it\u2019s a good one. \n \n HH: Let me put up a flare. The word substantially, to my lawyer\u2019s ears, is a terrible word, because substantially is in the eye of the beholder, and I just don\u2019t trust them. And you know, you\u2019ve run into this. I believe they\u2019d certify substantially completed if you mandated a thousand miles of fence and they built then. They\u2019d say oh, we\u2019re substantially completed. How will people be able to challenge the administration\u2019s interpretation of the law if in fact they are interpreting it as though, as the way that they\u2019ve interpreted so many other laws like the Defense Of Marriage Act, like the immigration laws themselves? \n \n MR: Well, part of that is I think it\u2019s important that the plan is effective, not just that the inputs are there, but that it actually is working. And so that\u2019s why your people are discussing things like 90% apprehension rate, et cetera. The thing about substantially completed is imagine if you built, if you mandates a hundred miles of fence, but the last half mile, you can\u2019t build it for whatever reason, you know, the hurricane hits, or there\u2019s some sort of natural disaster, or you can\u2019t get an easement from the property owner, because you\u2019re involved in an eminent domain taking or what have you, I mean, all sorts of things could happen that impedes that. So you want to see the plan substantially completed. But you also want to see the plan be effective. So that\u2019s why you have these things about the 90% measures, and where that fits in, that\u2019s going to be part of this discussion as well as how that fits into the trigger. \n \n HH: But of course, condemnation is not an issue, right? You can authorize the taking of the property, and notwithstanding the Endangered Species Law or any other law, you can authorize that. Will the bill, I mean, are you going to fly speck this, Senator, make sure it really does provide border security? \n \n MR: I think like I said, it all depends on whether we\u2019re going to be able to prevent another wave of illegal immigration or not. And people are only going to vote for this, you\u2019re only going to get the votes you need to pass this, not to mention the broad bipartisan support to pass this, if your people feel comfortable that what we are voting on is real. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on, is to get to a point where people feel confident about it. \n \n HH: Senator Marco Rubio, always a pleasure, thank you, Senator. \n \n End of interview.",

    "document": "DUBAI (Reuters) - President-elect Hassan Rouhani called on Wednesday for the government and powerful clergy to end interference in the private lives of the Iranian people, free up Internet access and allow state media to be more open about Iran\u2019s problems. \n \n Iranian President-elect Hassan Rohani gestures to the media during a news conference in Tehran June 17, 2013. REUTERS/Fars News/Majid Hagdost \n \n Rouhani\u2019s comments began to flesh out his message of moderation at home and better relations abroad that contributed to his surprise election victory last month. \n \n His election prompted a huge outpouring of support from Iranians hungry for change after eight years of domestic security crackdowns and international confrontation under hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \n \n \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any rift or division between the government or the clergy especially at a time when people have pinned their hopes on seeing some sort of change in society,\u201d Rouhani, a mid-ranking cleric, told fellow clergymen in Tehran. \n \n \u201cA strong government does not mean a government that interferes and intervenes in all affairs. It is not a government that limits the lives of people. This is not a strong government,\u201d said Rouhani who takes office early next month. \n \n \u201cThe power of the government lies in improving popular trust and...offering services, decreasing problems, setting the stage for further development of all citizens to help meet the needs of the people and desire for change,\u201d he said in an address aired on state television. \n \n Rouhani is bolstered by his popular mandate and the backing of an alliance of moderates and reformers led by former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami - both sidelined by hardliners under Ahmadinejad. \n \n For now the divided hardline conservative camp has given Rouhani a relatively free ride, repeatedly emphasizing the high turnout in the election as a victory for the system rather than a defeat for themselves and the status quo. \n \n But with a majority in parliament, strong links to the powerful Revolutionary Guards and a grip on the top jobs in state media and the security apparatus, the hardliners could confound Rouhani\u2019s attempts to foster change, especially if they sense their positions are under direct threat. \n \n LOOSEN MEDIA CONTROLS \n \n During his election campaign, Rouhani demanded a loosening of the \u201csecurity atmosphere\u201d and on Wednesday signaled what steps he wanted to see taken. \n \n Filtering of the Internet in Iran, stepped up after social media was used to encourage and coordinate large protests following the disputed 2009 presidential election, had proved ineffective, Rouhani said, fittingly, on Twitter. \n \n \u201cWhich important piece of news has filtering been able to black out in recent years?\u201d he asked. \n \n At the same time, he criticized state broadcaster IRIB for ignoring issues inside Iran. \n \n The state has a monopoly over terrestrial television in Iran and though satellite receivers are banned and foreign news broadcasts are often blocked, many Iranians tune in to U.S. and Europe-based channels beaming news and entertainment into the Islamic Republic. \n \n \u201cWhen IRIB airs the birth of a panda in China but nothing about unpaid workers protesting, it is obvious that the people and youth will ignore it,\u201d Rouhani tweeted. \n \n The key to whether Rouhani will be able to succeed in his vision of a more open society within the Islamic system will be whether he receives the backing of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who sits at the top of Iran\u2019s complex hybrid system of clerical rule combined and elements of elected representation. \n \n A life-long insider in post-revolutionary Iran, Rouhani was for years Khamenei\u2019s personal representative on the National Security Council, managing to maintain the trust of the leader even as other moderates fell out of favor and hardliners moved into the ascendant, especially in the early Ahmadinejad years. \n \n But the next president will also have to temper the demands of a population that may want change faster than he can deliver. \n \n Facing potential political opposition at home, an economy incapacitated by tough international sanctions over Iran\u2019s nuclear dispute with the West, Rouhani has repeatedly urged patience. \n \n \u201cWe have a lot of problems facing us. No government in the history of Iran has faced the problems that this government is facing,\u201d Rouhani told the meeting of clerics. \u201cThe problems cannot be solved in a matter of days or months.\u201d ||||| Two weeks after his sensational victory Iran's president-elect, Hassan Rouhani, has expressed relatively progressive views about civil liberties, freedom of expression and the internet. \n \n Social networking sites such as Facebook were, he said, a welcome phenomenon. \n \n In his most outspoken interview in the Iranian media, Rouhani told Chelcheragh \u2013 a popular youth magazine \u2013 that he is opposed to segregation of sexes in society, would work to minimise censorship and believes internet filtering is futile. \n \n \"In the age of digital revolution, one cannot live or govern in a quarantine,\" he said as he made clear he is opposed to the authorities' harsh crackdown on Iranians owning satellite dishes, which millions have installed on rooftops for access to foreign-based TV channels illegal in the country. \n \n Rouhani, who has promised to put the Islamic republic back on the path of moderation after eight acrimonious years under the outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, warned that citizens' rights had been neglected. \n \n He said he stood in the June presidential election as a candidate critical of the current situation and also because he felt the country was at peril. \n \n \"Today the republican [nature] of our country is overshadowed by a specific interpretation of its Islamic [character],\" he said. \n \n Rouhani's reference to the republican character of Iran's ruling system is a hint that the Islamic republic's legitimacy is meant to come from the popular vote. Rouhani is scheduled to be sworn into office in early August. \n \n \"Some of the principles of our constitution have been emphasised while others were neglected and this is why we are facing an imbalance as a result,\" he said. \n \n \"The freedom and rights of people have been ignored but those of the rulers have been emphasised \u2026 Restricting [people's right] to criticise will only stifle and lead to inefficiency.\" \n \n Of internet filtering, Rouhani said some of the measures taken by the authorities to restrict users' access online was not done in good faith and was instead politically motivated. \n \n \"There are political reasons. They have fears of the freedom people have in online atmosphere, this is why they seek to restrict information. But filtering is incapable of producing any [useful] results,\" he said. \n \n \"Supporters of internet filtering should explain whether they've successfully restricted access to information? Which important piece of news has filtering been able to black out in recent years?\" \n \n He added: \"Filtering has not even stopped people from accessing unethical [a reference to pornographic] websites. Widespread online filtering will only increase distrust between people and the state.\" \n \n Access to hundreds of thousands of websites is blocked in Iran, including Facebook and Twitter, but millions of Iranians use them via anti-filtering software or virtual private network (VPN) services. \n \n Despite the filtering, Rouhani's campaign was active on both sites at election time. \n \n \"The virtual space is a tool and it can be an opportunity or a threat,\" said Rouhani. \n \n \"I remember that [former president] Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani once called social networking websites such as Facebook a welcome phenomenon. Indeed they are.\" \n \n Since Rouhani's win, web users in Iran have reported a relative easing of online censorship and say revoked access to VPN accounts has been restored. \n \n Rouhani also pledged to minimise censorship of artistic and cultural works and said the state \u2013 instead of interfering in the affairs of artists and cultural figures \u2013 should provide them with security. \n \n \"We should not tighten the red lines all the time, we should show that censorship is not our goal,\" he said. \n \n On the question of women wearing the hijab, a contentious issue in a country with millions unhappy about the mandatory religious code, the president-elect said he was against the crackdown against women with loose clothing \u2013 but he stopped short of saying it should be left as voluntary. \n \n Each summer, as the heat bears down and makes it difficult for women and men in Iran to stick to their forced Islamic dress code, the religious police go out on to the streets to watch out for loose hijabs, inappropriate dress or hairstyles. \n \n \"I'm certainly against these actions,\" said Rouhani, saying a women without a hijab is not necessarily without virtue. \n \n \"If a women or a man does not comply with our rules for clothing, his or her virtue should not come under question \u2026 In my view, many women in our society who do not respect our hijab laws are virtuous. Our emphasis should be on the virtue.\" \n \n In his interview, Rouhani said he opposed segregation of men and women, including at universities, and criticised the politicians who are against allowing women to enter stadiums to watch football matches along with men. \n \n Iran's state television, IRIB, the mouthpiece of the country's ruling system, also came under attack from Rouhani. \n \n \"A large population of our youth are ignoring the [state] television because in it they haven't seen the honesty, morality, justice that it merits,\" he said. \n \n \"When the state TV shows a programme about the birth of a panda in a Chinese zoo but doesn't broadcast anything about workers staging a protest because they haven't been paid for six months \u2026 it's obvious that people and the youth will ignore it. The solution is to have freedom of expression. \n \n \"If a day comes that our television shows more news coverage than foreign networks such as BBC, then people will reconcile with it.\" \n \n Rouhani has previously criticised the IRIB. During his first post-election speech at the weekend, he said a country which receives its legitimacy from its people should not fear free media. \n \n He also said: \"Injustice is an injustice \u2026 it's a double standard to call an injustice in an unfriendly country as an injustice but to label the same thing in a friendly country as not \u2026 human rights is same in any place around the world.\"",

The idea is to find the tombs of Genghis Khan and his descendants, and other ancient Mongolian artifacts. \n \n Lin\u2019s army of helpers are amateurs, working from the comfort of their home computers. \n \n Through a Web site called Field Expedition Mongolia, which Lin and his colleagues developed jointly with National Geographic, volunteers are helping sift through 85,000 high-resolution satellite images of Mongolia. \n \n Every time volunteers log in to the site, they are shown some of these images. An online tutorial instructs them on how to look for particular objects and tag them as \u201croads,\u201d \u201crivers,\u201d \u201cmodern structures\u201d or \u201cancient structures.\u201d They can zoom in and out and scroll in all directions. \n \n They are also told to simply tag places as \u201cother\u201d if they see something peculiar. This is the sort of vague judgment that humans can perform but that computers cannot, Lin said. \n \n \u201cWhat a computer can\u2019t do is look for \u2018weird things,\u2019 but when you ask a human brain, you don\u2019t have to tell it what \u2018weird\u2019 is; we know,\u201d Lin said. \n \n Those weird things could be important archaeological finds, he said. \n \n Last summer, Lin and his colleagues were in Mongolia inspecting the places that had been tagged by the online volunteers. Anytime there was a cluster of tags marked as \u201cancient structure\u201d or \u201cother,\u201d they would note the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, grab their GPS devices and scope it out. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019d literally jump on horses or get in a helicopter and go check it out,\u201d said Lin. \u201cEvery tag was weighted on how many other people tagged the same thing.\u201d \n \n Projects like this one mark a new twist in \u201ccitizen science,\u201d where new technology, when used effectively by large groups of people, can help speed up scientific developments, reduce costs and increase efficiency. \n \n Sometimes online volunteers led the explorers to disappointing finds, such as a herd of sheep on a satellite photo that looked like an ancient structure. But there were also some remarkable ones, such as the discovery of 3,000-year-old Bronze Age tombs, remnants of large cities and ancient monoliths hidden in the region\u2019s vast, grassy steppe. \n \n \u201cThese are hard to find on horseback, but from space and in the images, you can make out these shapes,\u201d Lin said. \n \n Making it fun \n \n Though professional scientists have collaborated with amateurs for decades, social networking and the Internet are making it more fruitful than ever. \n \n \u201cWe found that we could make something that was engaging enough to inspire people to participate without having to pay them,\u201d says Lin. \u201cThis is the part of citizen science that is most interesting to me: How can we motivate people to dedicate their time?\u201d \n \n How? By making it fun, Lin said. \n \n Lin began thinking about creating an online expedition that tied into his real one about five years ago, when Amazon.com\u2019s Mechanical Turk made its debut. \n \n An online crowdsourcing marketplace, Mechanical Turk allows requesters with small tasks to pay people for their time. Anyone with an Amazon account can participate, and the tasks are usually quite simple, such as \u201cpick out the images with tattoos from this set,\u201d or \u201cverify the existence of these business Web sites.\u201d Some tasks pay just pennies, per task or verification, while others pay more. \n \n Lin believed that he could get more traction by creating a site that offered a fun experience rather than a paid one. \u201cPeople are so excited to learn about Mongolian archaeology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey start to learn stuff about what they\u2019re doing and feel more connected to what\u2019s going on in that part of the world.\u201d \n \n Every volunteer who logs on to the Valley of the Khans project site, developed with a design company called Digitaria, gets to feel like an explorer, digging through images and playing what feels like a game but performing work that has much more significant ramifications. \n \n \u201cIt connects you more on a personal level than going to a museum,\u201d said Allison Shefcyk, a 24-year-old in Connecticut who tagged more than 50,000 images from her home computer. \u201cI ended up picking up some books on Genghis Khan and Mongol culture, and even though I never set foot there, it all provided a deeply moving experience.\" \n \n Biomedicine and galaxies \n \n The Khan expedition is not the only research project engaging people on their home computers with gaming strategies. \n \n Another is EteRNA, created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford universities. It allows players to tinker with nucleotide bases and come up with synthetic RNA designs. \n \n The creators of the site hope that by generating a large assortment of designs, they can speed up discoveries in biomedicine. Every week, the most promising designs are actually synthesized by scientists in a lab at Stanford. \n \n An older project, Galaxy Zoo, allows volunteers to help classify images of galaxies taken by a robotic telescope in a project called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. \n \n There were thousands of images to classify, so researchers decided to create a crowdsourcing tool that uses the public\u2019s help in making classifications. \n \n To participate, volunteers flip through images and answer simple questions, such as whether a certain galaxy looks completely round, partially round or cigar-shaped. \n \n A year after its July 2007 launch, Galaxy Zoo had more than 50 million classifications from more than 150,000 people. The project so far has generated more than 20 academic papers by researchers around the world in astrophysics and astronomy journals. \n \n And birds, too \n \n Another project, run by the U.S. Geological Survey, is using crowdsourcing and technology to digitize a project called the Bird Phenology Program. \n \n The project was started by Wells Cooke, an American ornithologist who wanted to gather information on bird migration. Starting in 1881, amateur bird-watchers mailed in thousands of index cards detailing information on birds they had seen, first to Cooke and then to the American Ornithologists\u2019 Union. The federal government maintained the program in its final years, but participation declined and it was closed in 1970. \n \n But the cards, and the wealth of information they contain, remain in file cabinets. The U.S. Geological Survey is scanning the cards, and volunteers can log on and enter the information into a central database. \n \n It\u2019s secretarial work, not rocket science, said Jake Weltzin, executive director of the National Phenology Network, the USGS-funded organization that is coordinating the program, but \u201cpeople really like to contribute to the scientific process and really feel they are contributing to a bigger project,\u201d Weltzin said. \n \n \u201cThese are all volunteers; one person has digitized 20,000 cards,\u201d Weltzin said. \u201cWe couldn't afford to pay her.\u201d \n \n Eventually, researchers will be able to use the data to study population changes, and perhaps better understand the effect of climate change on birds and their habitats. \n \n Shefcyk, the enthusiastic volunteer in the Valley of the Khans project, said that participating was particularly meaningful to her. \n \n As a child, Shefcyk had trouble fitting in with other kids and was eventually identified as having an autism spectrum disorder. But she spent her time devouring books on archaeology and reading nonstop about dinosaurs, Egyptian pyramids and Mayan ruins. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t have many friends, and archaeology was the whole world to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI would always start conversations and ask things like \u2018Who\u2019s your favorite Mayan king?\u2019 \u201d \n \n Flash forward 15 years and Shefcyk is still fascinated by archaeology and is a frequent visitor to the National Geographic Web site. When she found out that ordinary people could help Lin with his project, she was intrigued. So every day last summer, while Lin\u2019s team was in Mongolia, she would tag images and look out for blog posts from the scientists. She was enthralled to read their chronicles and get quick feedback on the sites they visited. The explorers also offered tips to help volunteers tag objects more accurately. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you\u2019re adding your piece, and it\u2019s about knowing that you\u2019re something that\u2019s much bigger than yourself, no matter how small the involvement,\u201d she said. \n \n As for whether any of the tagging has gotten him closer to finding the burial site of Genghis Khan or one of his successors, Lin is coy. \u201cI can\u2019t say yet what we found,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of compiling the research.\u201d \n \n Bhanoo is a science writer based in the San Francisco Bay area.",

This data is currently not publicly accessible. ||||| Most psychologists agree that a person's basic personality\u2014whether they are an introvert or extrovert, for example\u2014remains the same throughout life. What we might see as personality changes are actually just responses to external factors, such as getting a job, getting married or becoming a parent. That said, research does indicate that our personalities become more solidified, or stable, as we get older. \n \n That change is not linear, however. New research indicates that our personalities become increasingly stable as our 20s melt into our 30s, 40s and even 50s, but that that stability then often begins to taper off in old age, Research Digest reports. \n \n Researchers in New Zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice, with a gap of two years in between. The survey measured a person's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience, Research Digest writes. They compared how people's scores varied between years, and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another, depending on age. \n \n Most people's personalities were generally stable, they found, but the stability of those trait followed a bell curve over time, peaking at middle-age and then dropping again. For certain traits\u2014conscientiousness, openness to experience, and honesty-humility\u2014Research Digest writes, the oldest participants' personality stability matched those of the youngest. \n \n Other interesting finds included \"domain specific\" variations, or ones that seem to be linked to what a person is dealing with at a particular point in their life. People in their 30s, for example, showed high levels of neuroticism, but by the time they reached their 50s that had tapered off and had been replaced by conscientiousness, openness and honesty-humility.",

And these biological and social changes may be the reasons behind what researchers are calling less stable personalities at those life stages. In fact, according to a study of almost 4,000 New Zealanders between the ages of 20 and 80, the stability of one's personality increases through youth and into middle age and peaks in our 50s, before we slide back into less stable versions of ourselves, reports Research Digest. As the Smithsonian puts it, \"in some ways, our 80-year-old selves mirror our 20-year-old selves.\" Some traits peaked at different times; the most stable traits in one's 30s are extraversion and neuroticism, while in the late 40s and early 50s it is openness, honesty-humility, and conscientiousness. The only trait that showed \"gradually reduced stability\" throughout life was agreeableness; apparently we are simply less and less agreeable as we pack the years on. Still, one's most basic personality\u2014introvert vs. extrovert, for example\u2014tends to remain consistent throughout one's life, even if the stability of traits waxes and wanes, notes the Smithsonian.

    "document": "This undated photo provided by the U.S. Marshal's office shows Adel Daoud, of Hillside, Ill. Daoud is charged with terrorism for allegedly trying to set off what he thought was a car bomb Sept. 14, 2012, near a downtown Chicago bar. (AP/AP) \n \n Four days before a sweeping government surveillance law was set to expire last year, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the chamber\u2019s Intelligence Committee, took to the Senate floor. She touted the law\u2019s value by listing some of the terrorist attacks it had helped thwart, including \u201ca plot to bomb a downtown Chicago bar\u201d that fall. \n \n \u201cSo I believe the FISA Amendments Act is important,\u201d the California Democrat said before a vote to extend the 2008 law, \u201cand these cases show the program has worked.\u201d \n \n Today, however, the government is refusing to say whether that law was used to develop evidence to charge Adel Daoud, a 19-year-old Chicago man accused of the bomb plot. \n \n And Daoud\u2019s lawyers said in a motion filed Friday that the reason is simple. The government, they said, wants to avoid a constitutional challenge to the law, which governs a National Security Agency surveillance program that has once again become the focus of national debate over its reach into Americans\u2019 private communications. \n \n \u201cWhenever it is good for the government to brag about its success, it speaks loudly and publicly,\u201d lawyers Thomas Durkin and Joshua Herman wrote in their motion. \u201cWhen a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are at stake, however, it quickly and unequivocally clams up under the guise of State Secrets.\u201d \n \n If the government acknowledged that it had used evidence derived from the FISA Amendments Act, Daoud would have standing to challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality. Specifically, Daoud\u2019s lawyers would be able to take on a provision known as Section 702. The law permits the interception of foreign targets\u2019 \u00ade-mails and phone calls without an individual warrant, including when the foreigners are in communication with Americans or legal residents. \n \n The U.S. Supreme Court in February rejected a constitutional challenge to Section 702 by a group of journalists, lawyers and human rights advocates, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not proved that their communications had been intercepted. \n \n But the court also said that if the government intends to use information derived from the Section 702 surveillance in a prosecution \u201cit must provide advance notice of its intent,\u201d and a defendant may challenge the lawfulness of the surveillance. The government assured the court that it would give such notice to criminal defendants. \n \n In a filing this month in Chicago, U.S. Attorney Gary S. Shapiro refused to say whether the evidence was obtained under Section 702. Instead, he said, the government told Daoud the evidence was acquired pursuant to a traditional FISA court order, rather than under the expanded surveillance program authorized in 2008. A traditional order requires the government to go to a FISA judge and show probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power. \n \n Daoud\u2019s attorneys say in their pleading that the government is being disingenuous. \u201cWe believe it is clear that the evidence . . . came from Section 702,\u201d Durkin said in an interview. \u201cEither Senator Feinstein\u2019s information was correct in December 2012, or she was given wrong information. The government has never disputed what she said.\u201d \n \n A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office had no comment but noted that the office had replied to Daoud\u2019s initial request for notice earlier this month in Shapiro\u2019s filing. \n \n \u201cThe most troubling part of the case is the government seems to be trying to hide the ball,\u201d said Alex Abdo, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the Supreme Court case on behalf of the journalists, lawyers and activists. \u201cThey told the Supreme Court not to worry about reviewing the FISA Amendments Act because it would get reviewed in a criminal case. They said if they used the evidence in a criminal case, they\u2019d give notice. Now they\u2019re telling criminal defendants they don\u2019t have to tell them. It\u2019s a game of three-card monte with the privacy rights of millions of Americans.\u201d \n \n Abdo said the original FISA statute, passed in 1978, requires the government to notify defendants when evidence being used against them is derived from surveillance authorized by the law. The court, he said, should require the government to abide by the law. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cthe most sweeping surveillance program ever enacted by Congress will never be reviewed in public by a court.\u201d \n \n Similarly, Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at American University, said, \u201cEveryone knows the role that Section 702 is playing in a case like this.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthanks in part to the Supreme Court, the government can use Section 702 and then never have to defend its constitutionality.\u201d \n \n The central problem with Section 702, critics say, is its breadth and lack of individual warrants. The law targets non-U.S. persons \u201creasonably believed\u201d to be located outside the United States but does not require that the government obtain a warrant before intercepting communications. \n \n Moreover, the purpose of the collection is \u201cforeign intelligence,\u201d a broad category that may include everything from information on terrorism to nuclear proliferation to what a European journalist is writing on human rights abuses or an African businessman is saying about global financial risk, experts say. \n \n According to a criminal complaint filed by an FBI agent, Daoud received an e-mail in February 2012 regarding his registration with an online jihadi forum overseas. In May 2012, Daoud sent himself a link for nine issues of Inspire magazine, an online publication put out by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an al-Qaeda affiliate. \n \n That same month, two FBI undercover employees posing as jihadists contacted Daoud online in response to material he had posted. Between July and September, an undercover FBI agent met Daoud in Chicago and helped him plan the attack. \n \n Daoud was arrested in September after he attempted to detonate a bomb placed in a jeep outside a Chicago bar with a remote-triggering device. \n \n Durkin said that he thought the FBI used surveillance powers under Section 702 to identify Daoud and then got a traditional FISA order to conduct its sting against him. \n \n \u201cNonetheless,\u201d he said in the motion Friday, \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in confusing these two issues is obvious. If it can avoid giving proper notice to defendants, as it seeks to do here, the government can avoid a challenge to the [FISA Amendments Act] altogether.\u201d \n \n U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman has set a trial date for February. ||||| Lawyers in Chicago terror case question what sparked investigation \n \n Attorneys for Adel Daoud wrote that prosecutors are purposely hiding information to avoid a possible battle over the constitutionality of the secret spying program, which was authorized by Congress in 2008 under an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \n \n Lawyers for a west suburban teenager charged with plotting to set off a bomb outside a downtown Chicago bar accused prosecutors Friday of dodging questions about whether the investigation was sparked by a massive government surveillance program. \n \n From left, Defense attorney Thomas Durkin and father of the defendant Adel Daoud, speak with members of the press before attending a hearing for Daoud at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on Sept. 17, 2012. (Armando L. Sanchez ) \n \n Daoud's attorney, Thomas Anthony Durkin, said he is asking only for a yes or no on whether evidence in his case was derived from the expanded law, not for the highly classified content or details of the searches. \n \n Prosecutors wrote in an earlier filing that they have no obligation to disclose the information unless ordered by the judge presiding over Daoud's case. \n \n The surveillance programs \u2014 including one that collects U.S. phone records and another that tracks Internet use by foreigners with possible links to terrorism \u2014 were exposed earlier this month by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked details to news organizations. \n \n In the ensuing uproar, government officials have defended the programs as a highly effective weapon against terrorism. Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee earlier this week, an FBI official said Internet surveillance was pivotal in the arrest of Najibullah Zazi in 2009 for plotting to bomb a New York subway. \n \n The filing by Daoud's attorney scolded the government for trying to have it both ways. \n \n \"Whenever it is good for the government to brag about its success, it speaks loudly and publicly,\" Durkin wrote. \"When a criminal defendant's constitutional rights are at stake, however, it quickly and unequivocally clams up under the guise of state secrets.\" \n \n Daoud, 19, of Hillside, came under FBI scrutiny after posting messages online about killing Americans, authorities have said. FBI analysts posing as terrorists exchanged messages with him and ultimately helped him plan an attack. Daoud was arrested in September after being accused of trying to detonate what he thought was a powerful car bomb outside a bar in the Loop. \n \n Daoud, who has pleaded not guilty, is set to go on trial in February in federal court in Chicago. \n \n jmeisner@tribune.com",

Police said Scott was not the suspect that officers sought but that he was holding a handgun, which investigators recovered from the scene, and posed a threat because he was not obeying police orders to remain inside his car and drop the weapon. \n \n Officer Vinson subsequently fired his gun, striking Scott, who police said was treated immediately and later pronounced dead, police said. \n \n Vinson, who has been employed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department since July 21, 2014, and is currently assigned to the metro division.

(Editor's note: This video contains graphic content.) (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department) \n \n Police in Charlotte, N.C., released video from one body camera and one dashboard camera on Sept. 24th of the fatal Keith Scott shooting. (Editor's note: This video contains graphic content.) (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department) \n \n Police officials here relented amid increasing pressure Saturday and released two videos showing the shooting death of a black man by police five days ago that has sparked several nights of sometimes-violent protests. \n \n The videos \u2014 one taken from an officer\u2019s body camera and another from the dashboard camera of a police vehicle \u2014 show Keith Lamont Scott, 43, exiting his vehicle and falling to the ground. But they do not answer a crucial question about whether Scott was holding a gun as police have said and Scott\u2019s family has denied. \n \n The police department also offered fresh insight into how the encounter happened. Plainclothes officers were sitting in an unmarked car at an apartment complex preparing to serve an arrest warrant against someone else when Scott pulled in beside them, the department said. The officers initially noticed that the 43-year-old was rolling a marijuana \u201cblunt\u201d in his car \u2014 and then saw him raise a gun, the police said. The combination of the gun and the marijuana created a public safety hazard, the officers concluded. The officers left and returned in vests and equipment that identified them as cops. \n \n That is when the encounter began, police say. \u201cThere was a crime that he had committed [possessing marijuana] that caused the encounter, and then the gun exacerbated that encounter,\u201d said \u00ad Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney at a news conference. \n \n Putney\u2019s office also released photos of a gun, an ankle holster and a \u201cblunt.\u201d The gun was loaded and had Scott\u2019s fingerprints and DNA, according to police. \n \n Rakeyia Scott filmed a cellphone video during her husband Keith Lamont Scott's fatal encounter with Charlotte police officers on Sept. 20. (Editor's note: This video contains graphic images and language.) (Family of Keith Lamont Scott) \n \n Scott\u2019s widow, who was standing nearby when the shooting occurred, remains unconvinced that the gun was in her husband\u2019s hand or pointed at officers when he was shot, the family\u2019s attorney said. \n \n \u201cOur goal has, from the beginning, been to get the absolute unfiltered truth, and the only way to get that for the police is to release the videos,\u201d said Ray Dotch, Scott\u2019s \u00adbrother-in-law. \u201cUnfortunately, we are left with far more questions than we have answers.\u201d \n \n The fatal shooting has turned Charlotte, considered by many the beacon of the \u201cNew South,\u201d into the latest U.S. city to face tough questions about the treatment of minorities by police. Hundreds of protesters have descended on the city\u2019s uptown for the past five nights, prompting the state\u2019s governor to call in the National Guard and the city\u2019s mayor to put in place a midnight curfew. \n \n The city was still healing from the shooting death of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was shot by a white police officer in 2013 when Scott\u2019s death reopened old wounds, protesters have said. \n \n The chief focus of protesters had been the release of the police videos, but now even that doesn\u2019t appear to be enough. \n \n \u201cWhat does marijuana have to do with it? Why did he mention that?\u201d asked Kayla Jefferson, 24, who was among hundreds of protesters listening to the news conference at a park in uptown. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make him look like a bad guy without releasing all of the information.\u201d \n \n Neighbors of Keith Scott, the African American man whose fatal shooting by police in Charlotte, N.C. spurred days of protests react to cellphone video of the encounter that was recorded by his wife. (Reuters) \n \n Charlotte officials appeared to acknowledge that the controversy surround the shooting would continue. No matter what the police department releases it will not satisfy Black Lives Matter protesters, Bill James, a 10-term commissioner for Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, said in a Twitter post. \u201cYou cannot satiate a mob with facts. Not in Ferguson, Baltimore, or Charlotte,\u201d he said. \n \n [GOP lawmakers\u2019 remarks amid unrest in Charlotte point to more alienation from black voters, critics say] \n \n Putney, the police chief, said he decided to make the video footage available after confirming that doing so would not hurt an investigation into the shooting being carried out by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. There are other videos and pieces of evidence, including statements by the police officers who witnessed the shooting, that will be released later, he said. \n \n The two videos were not enough for some protesters. \u201cWe would like to see full transparency,\u201d said Nicole Galloway, 28, who lives in Charlotte and was among the protesters Saturday. \u201cWe believe in justice and we believe in full transparency, so we can all see what happened.\u201d \n \n The videos show officers in police tactical vests taking up position behind the cab of their white flatbed truck. Scott then exits his own vehicle, which is reverse parked, with his back to the officers. It is not clear if Scott is holding anything in either hand. \n \n As he approaches the end of the officers\u2019 truck, he turns slightly to the right, and police open fire. Four gunshots are heard; Scott falls and can be heard moaning. Scott was shot by Brentley Vinson, an African American officer. \n \n The release of the videos came one day after footage shot by Scott\u2019s wife, Rakeyia Scott, showing her pleading with officers not to shoot her husband of 20 years, was made public. In the video, Rakeyia Scott can be heard yelling to the officers that her husband was unarmed and had a traumatic head injury. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him,\u201d she says. \n \n Officers say Scott pointed a gun at them; Scott\u2019s family has disputed that he was armed and that, if he was, that he raised the weapon. \n \n \u201cMr. Scott does not appear to be acting aggressive,\u201d attorney Justin Bamberg said of the video. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lunge at the officers. It appears he has his hands by his side. The moment he is shot, he is passively stepping back.\u201d \n \n [Read the Charlotte police department\u2019s investigative summary on the Keith Lamont Scott shooting] \n \n That dispute is not settled by these videos, and it is unclear how long it will be before the State Bureau of Investigation completes its examinations. \n \n Putney said that he has no plans to charge any of the officers involved in the fatal shooting with a crime but left open the possibility that charges could come from the state investigation. \u201cIf laws were violated I would be taking different action,\u201d he said. \n \n Many stores in uptown Charlotte have been closed since violent demonstrations began Tuesday evening, and even those that are open are seeing little business or closing early. Bank of America and Wells Fargo, which have thousands of employees in the area, told them to stay home most of the week. Restaurants and businesses in the city popular uptown Epicentre closed early, by 4 p.m. in most cases, most of the week. \n \n Hundreds of protesters have spent hours snaking their way through uptown Charlotte over the past few days, continuing to demonstrate hours past the city\u2019s midnight curfew. Police officers on bicycles have watched close by, directing traffic away from major highways, and National Guard troops stood in front of major city markers, including Bank of America Stadium, the home of the Carolina Panthers. \n \n Unlike the early days of protests, when demonstrators broke windows and police arrested dozens of people, marches over the past several evenings have remained relatively calm. Several local clergy members, who wore yellow ribbons on their arms to distinguish themselves, say that after the initial violence, they are focused on defusing any potential conflicts. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for me to be in the pulpit,\u201d said Byron Davis, leader of Liberation Ministries in Charlotte. \u201cWe\u2019re here where Jesus would be.\u201d \n \n On Saturday, hundreds of protesters emerged again, this time chanting \u201crelease the full tapes.\u201d \n \n Instead of satisfying protesters\u2019 questions about the incident, the limited video release generated new suspicions among some. \"I feel like they cut out the parts that were most important,\" said Erin Richards, 25. \"I feel like they didn't show anything. They cut out the stuff that mattered. You can't see the shooter, you can't see a gun. You can't see anything.\" \n \n \u201cI\u2019m out here because I have three sons who I do not want to have become a hashtag,\u201d said Verdetta Turner, 40, of Charlotte. \n \n Her oldest son, Justus Jenkins, 15, followed not far behind his mother, carrying a sign that declared: \u201cMy humanity should not be up for debate. I don\u2019t wanna be a hashtag.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m out here to stand with the cause and make a difference,\u201d \u00adJustus said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a police problem. I think that it\u2019s a racism problem, it\u2019s a stereotype problem of police fearing black people. . . . They see us and they fear us.\u201d \n \n By 1:45 am the crowd had shrunk to about 50 people who continued to march through the streets and chant peacefully. Police continue to follow at a distance. \n \n Ann Gerhart in Washington and Sarah Larimer in Charlotte contributed to this report. ||||| Video footage released Saturday shows Keith Lamont Scott taking four steps slowly backward with his arms at his sides when he is hit in a burst of four gunshots from police, then crumples to the pavement. \n \n From neither vantage point \u2013 a police dashboard camera and a body camera worn by one of the officers on the scene \u2013 can it be determined whether Scott is holding a gun. \n \n But police can be heard repeatedly shouting \u201cDrop the gun!\u201d at the 43-year-old Scott, who died from his wounds Tuesday as his wife stood nearby. \n \n SIGN UP \n \n Be the first to know.

In a press conference, Chief Kerr Putney \n \n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney released the videos Saturday after a tumultuous week of protests and two nights of street violence spurred by the shooting. \n \n In the dashboard video, a police SUV can be seen pulling into the parking lot where Scott\u2019s white SUV is parked. An officer in a red shirt is visible pointing his weapon at Scott\u2019s vehicle, whose tinted windows are up. \n \n In a deadly tableau lasting about three seconds, Scott, surrounded by officers at varying distances, then opens his door, steps out, turns and walks backward, hands at his side. Four shots are heard and he falls. \n \n In neither video is the resolution good enough to show whether Scott was holding a weapon. Nor does either show the officer firing at him. \n \n A body cam on another officer at the scene shows Scott emerging from the SUV, then lying in the parking lot seconds later. Police handcuff him while Scott\u2019s wife can be heard yelling at police, \u201cHe better be alive!\u201d \n \n Marijuana keyed action \n \n On Saturday, Putney said that Scott drew the attention of officers who were trying to serve an arrest warrant on an unrelated suspect at the Village at College Downs apartment complex in University City because they saw him rolling marijuana in his vehicle. \n \n Police were going to let it go and continue on their original mission until an officer spotted a weapon in the vehicle, Putney said. \n \n \u201cIt was not lawful for him to possess a firearm,\u201d Putney said. \u201cThere was a crime he committed and the gun exacerbated the situation.\u201d \n \n Officer Brentley Vinson, who Putney said fired four shots at Scott, was not wearing a body cam, so his visual perspective was not part of the footage. Putney said that body cameras are being rolled out across the department and not all tactical officers have them yet. \n \n Putney said the footage supports the larger weight of evidence in the case, which includes accounts from officers at the scene, forensics and interviews with witnesses. \n \n He said he has found nothing to indicate that Vinson acted inappropriately, given the totality of the circumstances, and he does not think his officers broke the law that day. \n \n They were, he said, reacting to what appeared to be an imminent threat. \n \n \u201cAt every encounter, people can make a decision to follow lawful, loud verbal commands and avert some things like this,\u201d he said. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney speaks to the media before releasing footage of a police shooting. \n \n Details of encounter \n \n Police on Saturday gave this account of the fatal encounter: \n \n Two officers in plain clothes were in an unmarked car waiting to serve a warrant when Scott\u2019s white SUV pulled in beside them. \n \n They saw Scott roll what they believed to be \u201ca marijuana \u2018blunt.\u2019 \u201d They returned to watching for their suspect, then Vinson saw Scott hold up a gun. \n \n They withdrew to a spot nearby and put on duty vests that said \u201cPolice\u201d that would identify them as officers. \n \n When they came back, Scott still had the gun. They identified themselves as police officers, the department said, and told him loudly and repeatedly to drop the weapon. Scott did not comply. \n \n Then a uniformed officer in a marked SUV drove up to assist, and an officer started pounding on the front passenger window. \n \n Scott then got out with the gun and backed away from the vehicle, police said, but did not drop the weapon. \n \n \u201cOfficer Vinson perceived Mr. Scott\u2019s actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and the other officers,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cOfficer Vinson fired his issued service weapon, striking Mr. Scott. Officers immediately rendered first aid and requested Medic to respond to the scene.\u201d \n \n Police said multiple witnesses interviewed by homicide detectives heard the police shouting at Scott to drop the gun. \n \n Scott\u2019s DNA and his fingerprints were found on the loaded gun recovered at the scene. Scott was wearing an ankle holster, police said. \n \n Family response \n \n Family members of Scott said they still have more questions than answers. \n \n \u201cIt does not make sense to us how this incident led to loss of life,\u201d said Scott\u2019s brother-in-law, Ray Dotch, who spoke at a press conference called by the Scott family after the videos were released. \u201cHe was an American citizen and he deserved better.\u201d \n \n Lawyers for the Scott family said the videos do not clearly identify what, if anything, Scott had in his hands. CMPD said he was holding a handgun, but the family believes he was unarmed, the lawyers said. \n \n When CMPD released the videos Saturday night, they also released photos of a handgun, ankle holster and marijuana blunt they said were in Scott\u2019s possession at the time of the incident. The gun was loaded, they said. \n \n Debate over release \n \n Widespread calls were heard during the week for release of the police video footage from civic and political quarters \u2013 and even street protesters who chanted \u201cRelease the tapes!\u201d repeatedly outside CMPD headquarters and in marches. \n \n On Friday, attorneys for Scott\u2019s family released a dramatic cellphone video taken by Rakeyia Scott during her husband\u2019s shooting. \n \n In it, she can be heard pleading with officers not to shoot as they shouted at Scott to drop his gun. \n \n Putney said the appearance of that footage had no impact on his decision to release the police videos. \n \n He said he decided to release the videos in the interest of transparency and because the State Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the inquiry in the case, had completed key interviews with witnesses and assured him the release would not harm the integrity of their probe. \n \n \u201cDoing so before this would have had a negative impact on the investigation,\u201d he said. \n \n In the aftermath of Scott\u2019s death, Charlotte was roiled by several nights of protests. After street violence on Tuesday and Wednesday night, dozens of arrests and the death of one man in uptown, Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency. \n \n Hundreds of National Guard and State Highway Patrol officers were sent into the city to restore calm and a midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew was announced. \n \n McCrory, who recently signed a law, going into effect Oct. 1, that sets new limits on public access to police videos, said he agreed with Putney\u2019s decision to release the tapes. \n \n \u201cWe have appreciated the ongoing dialogue and teamwork between state and city officials,\u201d McCrory said, \u201cto seek public transparency while protecting the integrity of the investigation and the rights of all parties involved in this case.\u201d \n \n \u2018A way forward\u2019 \n \n U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., whose district includes parts of Charlotte, said she hoped the release would lead to healing dialogue. \n \n \u201cWe all deserve the truth, justice and a way forward so that we can heal and become an example of a city that emerges stronger and safer because we choose to address our problems,\u201d she said, \u201ceven after all the television cameras have gone.\u201d \n \n Police had shown Scott\u2019s family two videos Thursday. Through their attorneys, the family requested they be immediately released to the public. \n \n Justin Bamberg, one of the family\u2019s lawyers, said after viewing the police tapes that he felt Scott\u2019s demeanor was calm and non-aggressive. \n \n Another video that appeared to have been taken by a resident of the apartment complex shooting from a balcony surfaced on social media on Friday. It showed police moving around Scott\u2019s body. \n \n Also at issue is a photograph that circulated this week on social media, and was shared by CMPD. It showed a dark shape near Scott\u2019s feet. Some have said the shape is a weapon. That shape is not apparent in Rakeyia Scott\u2019s video. \n \n Neither police video shows any weapons on the ground, but they were not well positioned to cover the entire scene. \n \n Teddy Kulmala of the Rock Hill Herald and Anna Douglas of the McClatchy Washington Bureau contributed.",

Perhaps I'm getting old!\" \n \n Indeed, so leisurely was his pace that Bolt could have run his world record of 9.58 four times, or practically completed a 400 metres race -- a fact not lost on Miyazaki. \n \n \"I'm still a beginner, you know,\" he said, grinning from ear to ear. \"I'll have to train harder. Training was going splendidly, so I had set myself a target of 35 seconds. I can still go faster.\" \n \n \"I will say this: I'm proud of my health,\" added Miyazaki, the poster boy for Japan's turbo-charged geriatrics in a country with one of the world's highest life expectancies. \n \n \"The doctors gave me a medical examination a couple of days ago and I'm fit as a fiddle. \n \n \"My brain might not be the sharpest but physically I'm tip-top. I've never had any health problems. The doctors are amazed by me. I can definitely keep on running for another two or three years.\" \n \n Dressed in his trademark red, tight shorts hiked alarmingly high, Miyazaki got off to a wobbly start before finding a gentle rhythm and trotting across the finish line to loud cheers, greeted by his great-grandchildren carrying bouquets. \n \n Cheekily, he celebrated by striking Bolt's famous \"lightning\" pose before being presented with a certificate from Guinness officials. \n \n - Dream race - \n \n Asked about Bolt's latest heroics at last month's athletics world championships in Beijing, Miyazaki screwed up his nose and said with a chuckle: \"He hasn't raced me yet!\" \n \n The twinkle-toed Miyazaki, who holds the 100 metres world record for centenarians at 29.83 seconds, insisted there was still time for a dream race against the giant Jamaican. \n \n \"I would still love to compete against him,\" said Miyazaki, who loses valuable seconds because he cannot hear the starter's gun go off. \n \n \"Two or three years ago Bolt came to Japan and said he wanted to meet me. There was a call about it but I was out and he left without meeting me. I felt deeply sorry.\" \n \n Miyazaki, who was born in 1910 -- the year Japan annexed Korea and when the Titanic was still being built -- only took up running in his early 90s and prepares for races by taking a sneaky catnap. \n \n He stands just 1.53 metres (five feet) tall and weighs in at 42 kilograms (92 pounds). \n \n He trains religiously by popping a kilogram weight into a rucksack and going for daily walks around his local park in Kyoto, where he now lives. \n \n \"It's all about willpower,\" Miyazaki said of his need for speed. \"You have to keep going.\" \n \n Japanese television crews jostled as Miyazaki, a native of tea-growing Shizuoka prefecture, arrived for his record tilt sporting dapper white slacks and a Panama hat. \n \n Job done on the track, the Japanese iron man proved he was a dab hand at the shot put, tossing a best effort of 3.25 metres before calling it a day. \n \n \"I can't think about retiring,\" said Miyazaki, whose next competition is next month's Japanese Masters Championships. \"I have to continue for a few more years, to show my gratitude to my fans.\" ||||| Hidekichi Miyazaki has today once again broken his own record for Oldest competitive sprinter after running in the 100m at the Kyoto Masters Athletics Autumn Competition in Kyoto, Japan. \n \n Miyazaki was born on 22 September 1910 and has just celebrated his 105th birthday. \n \n \n \n \n \n The impressive centenarian finished the race in just 42.22 seconds, greeted by his proud great-grandchildren. \n \n Speaking afterwards, perfectionist Miyazaki said: \"Today my target was 35 seconds ... I shed tears of disappointment because I was not in good condition. I am not satisfied with today's time. But I am satisfied that I could cross finish line.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nevertheless, Mr Miyazaki is often referred to as the \u201cGolden Bolt\u201d because he boldly imitates Usain Bolt\u2019s renowned lightening pose. \n \n He longs for the opportunity to challenge the legendary Jamaican sprinter (who holds the fastest 100 m record at 9.58 secs), and when asked about Bolt's recent successes at the Athletics World Championships, Miyazaki jokes: \"He hasn't raced me yet!\" \n \n Guinness World Records adjudicator Kaoru Ishikawa waited on the sidelines ready to present the runner with his third official certificate and a copy of Guinness World Records 2016 \n \n \n \n \n \n Mr Miyazaki's record is all the more incredible as he picked up the sport in his 90s, explaining that he started running as he needed a new hobby to do on his own as many of his friends that he had played the board game Go with had sadly passed away. \n \n The Golden Bolt had previously set the record on two occasions, the first time in 2013 at the age of 103, after finishing 100m in 34.10 seconds. \n \n video \n \n He then went on to compete in the Asia Masters Athletics Championships in Kitakani, Japan last year at 104 years old, finishing in 34.61 seconds. \n \n But age is no limit for the inspirational sprinter, who asserts he will continue and improve: \"I will try my best again at coming Masters athleticsin Gifu next time.\"",

That factor demonstrates rather dramatically that the public should be protected.\u201d \n \n A judge on Monday ordered Dr. Conrad Murray to jail, just a few minutes after a jury found him guilty in the death of Michael Jackson. \n \n Murray, Michael Jackson's personal physician, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for causing the pop icon's 2009 death by a powerful surgical anesthetic. \n \n The verdict against Dr. Conrad Murray comes after a jury of seven men and five women deliberated for about nine hours over two days. The 58-year-old cardiologist, who was charged with the lowest possible homicide offense, faces a maximum sentence of four years in state prison and a minimum sentence of probation. \n \n Murray now also faces the probable loss of his medical license. California authorities already suspended his right to practice, but medical boards in Nevada and Texas agreed to wait to evaluate licenses he holds in their states until after the criminal case. \n \n Over four weeks, prosecutors painted Murray as a deceptive and incompetent doctor who abandoned his medical judgment in complying with Jackson's request to be given a surgical anesthetic to put him to sleep. \n \n Witnesses testified to many egregious medical missteps -\u2013 giving propofol in an unmonitored setting, fumbling at basic resuscitation, keeping no records \u2013- failures that experts said directly led to Jackson's overdose death. \n \n As his famed patient stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest under the influence of propofol, jurors were told, the doctor chatted on the phone and sent and received emails and text messages. And in the crucial moments after he discovered the singer had stopped breathing, he delayed calling for help and lied to paramedics and emergency doctors, witnesses said. \n \n Central to the government's case were the doctor's own words from a police interview two days after Jackson's death. In the 2-1/2-hour tape, Murray admitted to giving the singer the propofol -\u2013 caving in after Jackson repeatedly begged for it, he said -\u2013 as well as two other drugs earlier in the day. \n \n Admissions in the interview were enough evidence of the doctor's guilt, witnesses said. But the prosecution's star witness also said levels of the drug found during an autopsy showed Murray lied about how much propofol he administered. Dr. Steven Shafer, a renowned anesthesiologist and propofol expert, said the only plausible scenario was that Murray left a large drip of the anesthetic running into Jackson's blood after he was dead. \n \n RELATED: \n \n 'Michael Jackson got justice,' fan says \n \n Occupy L.A. protesters go to courthouse \n \n Conrad Murray trial: Who\u2019s who in the jury \n \n -- Victoria Kim and Harriet Ryan \n \n Photo: A bailiff handcuffs Dr. Conrad Murray behind his back in court Monday.

When Hatfield tried to recapture it, the snake bit him, Morse said. \n \n A bite from a cottonmouth can be deadly; its venom usually causes massive swelling. \n \n Hatfield was rushed to the emergency room. \n \n \u201cHis condition has improved today and he is expected to recover,\u201d Morse said. \n \n Hatfield had captured the snake sometime last week and was illegally possessing it, Morse said.

Belcher said the snake was initially in a pillow case. \n \n \"He took it out, put it on his chest and it was acting funny, and it jumped up and got him,\" he said. \n \n The snake lunged at Hatfield, biting him on his mouth. \n \n \"He ripped it off his face, threw it on the ground and he started swelling up immediately,\" Belcher said. \"It was pretty frightening.

They are typically two to four feet long, heavy-bodied snakes with heads wider than their jaws. \n \n They are pit vipers that have heat-detecting pits between their eyes and nostrils.

(Associated Press) \n \n Jewish settlers watch as movers employed by the Israeli Defense Ministry carry out belongings from settler's apartment in the Ulpana neighborhood in the West bank Jewish settlement of Beit El, near Ramallah,... (Associated Press) \n \n After it evacuates settlers from five apartment buildings in the Ulpana outpost this week, the government has promised to slice the structures from their foundations and move them to a West Bank site nearby, where they will be reassembled. \n \n Construction specialists say transplanting the buildings _ three-story concrete structures faced with stone and topped with red tile roofs _ would squander huge sums of money and be infinitely more complicated than destroying and rebuilding them. \n \n Netanyahu came up with the plan after the government was ordered to dismantle the outpost. People close to the prime minister say he believes that preserving the homes will ease the pain for the families. \n \n The Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government earlier this year to destroy Ulpana after determining it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. \n \n \"By the first of July, the plan is to have the buildings vacated and sealed,\" a government official said this week, speaking on condition of anonymity about a project whose details have not been finalized. \"The prime minister said he wanted these buildings relocated, not destroyed.\" \n \n The Palestinians claim all of the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war, as part of a future state. The Palestinians, along with virtually all of the international community, consider all Israeli settlements to be illegal or illegitimate. \n \n In Israel, any talk of uprooting settlements, now home to more than 500,000 Israelis, is contentious. The government divides the settlements into two categories _ those it authorized and those it did not. There are more than 100 authorized settlements and another 100 or so unauthorized outposts, some little more than a few trailers on a hilltop and others, like Ulpana, made up of concrete apartment houses. \n \n Most settlers do not make that distinction, opposing demolition of any Israeli structure in the West Bank. \n \n The unusual Ulpana arrangement is an attempt by the pro-settler Netanyahu to avert the prospect of destroying a settlement and battling its residents, who started packing their belongings and moving out of the buildings on Tuesday. \n \n Transplanting the buildings would solve that problem, but at a staggering cost, experts say. \n \n Specialists familiar with this type of operation say it would require slicing the buildings with huge circular blades, chopping them into smaller pieces, transferring them by crane to massive flatbed trucks and hauling them to their new location, where they would be reassembled like a puzzle. The sawing alone would take a week for each building and cost $125,000 for apiece for the five structures, said one of the specialists, speaking on condition of anonymity because final plans for the project have not yet been set. \n \n That expense would just be the starter. \n \n \"Sawing is not the problem. The problem is how to put them together again,\" because the slicing would cut through electrical wires, plumbing, structural rods and other parts of the apartment, forcing a large-scale reconstruction, said Israel David, vice chairman of the Israeli Association of Construction and Infrastructure Engineers. \n \n \"It's absurd,\" he said, estimating that total costs could go as high as $25 million to relocate 30 apartments that could be rebuilt for $150,000 apiece. \n \n The technique has been used in Israel before. In 2005, Israel moved five historic homes in the center of Tel Aviv to widen a road. \n \n Shay Tzadik, a 20-year veteran of the sawing business, said he appreciates the sentiment behind what Netanyahu is trying to do, but thinks it's beside the point. \n \n \"If it was an archaeological site, it would be worth the investment,\" Tzadik said. \"But why do it?\" \n \n ___ \n \n Blake Sobczak contributed reporting from Ulpana. ||||| \u201cThis is a black day for us,\u201d said Amir Dana, a father of five, as cranes lifted furniture out of the homes. \u201cThis is a moral and legal injustice, but we\u2019re peaceful people. None of us wanted a fight among brothers and a confrontation with police and soldiers.\u201d \n \n Like the other evacuees, he wore a black T-shirt that said, \u201cExpelled from my home. We\u2019ll be back.\u201d \n \n The scenes contrasted sharply with previous evictions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in which settlers put up passive or active resistance. The Ulpana settlers, who are religiously observant, said they complied with the directive of a prominent rabbi at Beit El, Zalman Melamed, who counseled them to avoid a violent confrontation. \n \n Militant settlers who have violently resisted other evictions were not in evidence at Beit El on Tuesday, although vandals torched a mosque in a Palestinian village this month, leaving behind graffiti promising \u201cwar\u201d over the Ulpana evictions. Some families said they would have to be carried out when their turn for evacuation comes later this week. \n \n Netanyahu, who reluctantly complied with the court order and blocked a bill sponsored by right-wing legislators to retroactively legalize building on private Palestinian land, has promised to construct 300 more homes in Beit El to compensate for the evacuation. He has also pledged to dismantle and relocate the five emptied apartment buildings, rather than raze them. \n \n That process cannot be completed by July 1, the deadline set by the court for demolishing the buildings, and the government on Tuesday requested an extension until mid-November. \n \n Michael Sfard, an attorney for the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din who represented the Palestinian landowners, said that despite the evacuation, the government was defying the court ruling, because the buildings would not be removed in time. \n \n \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s subject to the law,\u201d Sfard said. \u201cThey are creating a fait accompli and spitting in the face of the Supreme Court.\u201d \n \n The Palestinian landowners, from the village of Dura al-Qara, next to Beit El, are unlikely to gain access to their property anytime soon, because the area remains fenced off as part of the settlement. Other homes in the Ulpana neighborhood are built on land not covered by the court decision and will remain in place. \n \n Banners and graffiti near the evacuated buildings denounced Netanyahu and echoed the slogan of settlers evacuated from the Gaza Strip when Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005: \u201cA Jew does not expel a Jew.\u201d A handmade sign left on the door of an empty apartment said: \u201cThe Shimshi family lived here, until it was expelled.\u201d \n \n Carrying her child as she walked by the buildings, Yiska Fattal said she and other evacuees were worried that their removal might set a precedent for evictions at other settlements. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a danger that other homes will be destroyed in the same way; that\u2019s our biggest fear,\u201d she said. \n \n Two other settler outposts built on private Palestinian land also are slated for removal in the coming weeks under similar court orders. \n \n Unpacking as workers moved boxes and furniture into her new prefab home, Tehiya Ahituv said the state-funded accommodations were cold comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone takes your child and says, \u2018You have another one,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard is that they\u2019re evacuating part of the Land of Israel.\u201d",

Israel is in the process of evacuating the Ulpana outpost on the orders of its Supreme Court, which determined that five apartment blocks had been illegally built on private Palestinian land, reports the Washington Post. The Ulpana settlers, who were moved to prefabricated homes on a nearby military outpost, said a prominent rabbi had advised them to avoid confrontation with the military. \"This is not a happy day for Israel,\" one departing resident said. \"To leave a house is very simple, but to leave a home is very difficult.\" Several other evictions based on similar court orders are expected to take place over the next few weeks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the court order by vowing to build 850 new apartments in the West Bank to replace the 30 emptied units.

    "document": "Zambia\u2019s new, white vice president on understanding Mugabe and standing up to China \n \n Lusaka, Zambia \n \n Zambia\u2019s new vice president, Dr Guy Scott, sinks into the back seat of his armoured car. Motorbike outriders clear the traffic ahead of us as we glide through the capital. \u2018I am enjoying the toys, I must say.\u2019 He means the helicopter and the two motorcades \u2014 one for the city, another for the bush. \n \n There were two remarkable aspects to last October\u2019s election, in which the Patriotic Front party was voted in, ending the former government\u2019s 20-year rule. The first was the peaceful nature of the regime change. The other was the colour of Dr Scott\u2019s skin. It is the first time in independent Africa (Zambia gained its independence in 1964) that a white man has occupied such a high office. Recently George W. Bush passed through on a visit. \u2018When they introduced me as vice president, he thought they were kidding.\u2019 \n \n Our convoy swings into the forecourt of the capital\u2019s most expensive hotel. Sirens heralding Scott\u2019s arrival are another novelty, but he insists they are used only sparingly. Except on visits to his own constituency, he jokes, when they are put on full blast \u2014 in defiance of \u2018all those who thought I couldn\u2019t make it, mainly my fellow whites.\u2019 \n \n It is not surprising that his popularity among the black electorate prompted much talk in international circles of reconciliation with the colonial past, of a new style of African politics that transcends the hoary old issue of race. (Most Zambians, it should be noted, shrugged off his whiteness as a detail barely worthy of comment.) \n \n What may raise a few eyebrows, however, is his friendly relationship with an unlikely ally: Robert Mugabe. Or, as he calls the autocrat next door, \u2018Bob\u2019 \u2014 he has known him for many decades. He praises the Zimbabwean leader\u2019s performance at a recent trade summit in Malawi. \u2018You have this bloke presented to you as the local nutter, yet he was tremendously compos mentis. He spoke brilliantly. He was very clever. He nearly had the US ambassador crying into his tea, impressed with wonderment.\u2019 \n \n Less than 40,000 of Zambia\u2019s 13-million-strong population are white, but among them are many Zimbabweans forced to re-settle across the border. It goes against expectations, then, that Scott insists the central message of Mugabe\u2019s speech \u2014 namely, that Africa should keep hold of its own wealth, instead of losing out to foreign investors \u2014 \u2018was right on the money. It was very sensible stuff.\u2019 As sensible as Mugabe\u2019s land seizures and mismanagement of the world\u2019s fastest-shrinking economy? He sighs. \u2018What has happened is very cruel and nasty and doesn\u2019t reflect well on anybody. But it is worth trying to understand what is happening, rather than saying it\u2019s the lunatic act of one man. It\u2019s not.\u2019 \n \n It is an unusual viewpoint for a former farmer of British descent. Scott was born 67 years ago in Livingstone, on what is now the Zambian side of the Zambia-Zimbabwe border, to a mother from Watford and a Scottish father. Scott graduated in economics from Cambridge, researched robotics at Oxford, and wrote a phD in cognitive science before returning to Zambia at the dawn of multi-party politics in 1990. \n \n Today, his is the only white face in the entire Zambian national assembly, whose members sit in horseshoe formation around a stuffed leopard and lion and a magnificent pair of elephant tusks. The man Dr Scott calls \u2018The Boss\u2019 is Michael Sata, the 74-year-old firebrand president known by others as King Cobra. He appointed his old friend as deputy after winning the election on his fourth attempt. \u2018Michael knows about political symbolism. It\u2019s one in the eye for his critics who say he\u2019s a tribalist. Obviously, he\u2019s not.\u2019 \n \n It took very little time for an opponent to question Scott\u2019s claim to be Zambian, saying his foreign parentage made him ineligible for the post. (Constitutionally, it is only the president whose parents must have been born in the country. Should Sata become unfit, Scott would act as interim caretaker.) Still, Scott doubts a white man would have got this far in other sub-Saharan African countries lacking Zambia\u2019s stability and tolerance. \u2018I don\u2019t think I would be nearly as welcome in South Africa, for example. Or West Africa. I get the suspicion they are pretty dubious, wondering what a white man is doing there. But for some reason, I\u2019m very popular here.\u2019 \n \n How long that popularity lasts will depend on how he and Sata tackle Zambia\u2019s top priority \u2014 its complex relationship with China. The history of huge Chinese investment here dates back to the 1960s, when Kenneth Kaunda, first president of the republic, won help from Chairman Mao to build the Tazara railway. The tracks China built opened up trade by allowing landlocked Zambia access to the Indian ocean through Tanzania, rather than its white-ruled neighbours. Today, Zambia is Africa\u2019s biggest producer of copper and China is one of the world\u2019s hungriest consumers of it, and relations between the two are increasingly bitter, as local people struggle to compete against a huge influx of Chinese businesses and unskilled labour. \n \n Scott and Sata were swept to power on a vehemently anti-Chinese ticket. Scott admits they have had to tone down the \u2018China-bashing\u2019. \u2018There was no need for it,\u2019 he says. \u2018It was a shock tactic to point out the problems with the Zambian-Chinese relationship. The Chinese potentially have something very good to give, but they have a reputation for being somewhat \u2026 inhumane. They employ far more people, but they are terrible managers.\u2019 He points to a notorious clash at a mine last year, when two Chinese managers opened fire on workers as they protested against poor conditions. Eleven people were injured, but no one was prosecuted. \n \n \u2018It\u2019s an interesting paradox, the Chinese paradox \u2026You get open conflict quite a lot. The Chinese don\u2019t understand that they should be dealing with the unions. What they tend to do is cosy up to the leadership, take them shopping and hope to sterilise them. Then they don\u2019t have a conduit through which to speak to the workers \u2026 We must recalibrate that relationship.\u2019 \n \n Hospitable, charming, and no stranger to the unprintable expletive, Scott never quite loses the air of wily political operator.

After independence, he also spent time in London, working as a railway porter, and, back in Zambia, with a taxidermist company. \n \n At the fourth attempt, Mr Sata won presidential elections in 2011.

    "document": "American hostage Kayla Mueller was tortured, verbally abused, forced into slave labor for ISIS commanders in Syria and raped by the group's top leader, but her fellow hostages say she never surrendered hope, she selflessly put the welfare of fellow captives above her own and she even stood up to executioner \"Jihadi John\" to defend her Christian faith. \n \n Interested in ISIS? Add ISIS as an interest to stay up to date on the latest ISIS news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n Four former hostages who shared cells with Mueller, speaking publicly for the first time about their shared ordeal for ABC News' \"20/20\" broadcast, \"The Girl Left Behind,\" airing Friday, say the Prescott, Arizona, humanitarian aid worker was a courageous 25-year-old who inspired them. \n \n Their ISIS guards were overseen by the British tough Mohammed Emwazi, who would later be dubbed Jihadi John, as he carried out the beheadings and killings of 10 hostages. The Londoner led three other Britons who oversaw the hostage operation. Their prisoners called them \"The Beatles.\" \n \n In March 2014, Mueller was taken to a room next door several times where male hostages were being held. Former hostages said Emwazi paraded her in front of them to show prisoners about to be released who she was and to offer her own proof-of-life by removing her head scarf and briefly introducing herself. \n \n FULL BRIAN ROSS REPORT: \"The Girl Left Behind.\" \n \n Play \n \n Former hostage Daniel Rye Ottosen, a Danish freelance photographer, recalled how Mueller turned the tables on the men in black. \n \n \"One of the Beatles started to say, 'Oh, this is Kayla, and she has been held all by herself. And she is much stronger than you guys. And she's much smarter. She converted to Islam.' And then she was like, 'No, I didn't,'\" Ottosen told ABC News. \n \n He admits it surprised him a lot. He had once tried to strangle himself when ISIS guards strung his arms up by chains. \n \n \"I would not have had the guts to say that. I don't think so,\" he said. \"It was very clear that all of us were impressed by the strength that she showed in front of us. That was very clear.\" \n \n Daniel Rye Ottosen \n \n The only period in Mueller's 18 horrifying months as an ISIS hostage when she wasn't subjected to some form of torture, verbal abuse, prolonged isolation, sensory deprivation, stress positions, forced labor or sexual assault before she died in captivity was the six weeks she was held at an abandoned oil refinery in Syria, with other Western hostages in 2014. \n \n Because many of the ISIS captives were being individually negotiated for ransom with their governments, employers or families, the women, at least, inside the makeshift prison south of ISIS stronghold Raqqa were not subjected to the kind of abuses that Mueller said she experienced in other ISIS prisons before and after her time there, according to the Mueller family and those held captive with her. \n \n Three of the Westerners released by ISIS and a Yazidi teenager who escaped captivity provided eyewitness accounts to ABC News of Mueller's strength, selflessness and will to survive amid her considerable suffering, including details she gave them of her treatment when she was completely alone for most of her confinement by the terrorist group. \n \n \"They would scream at her, and they would, you know, blame her for everything that America has done in the world,\" Frida Saide, one of three women from Doctors Without Borders who shared a cell with Mueller at the oil refinery, told ABC News in an interview this month. \n \n \"They picked her apart,\" said Patricia Chavez, one of the other Doctors Without Borders aid workers held with Mueller. \n \n In her seventh month of captivity, Mueller's frequent isolation and moves between makeshift prisons in Aleppo and Raqqa was interrupted by the arrival at the oil refinery of Saide, Chavez and a dozen other hostages, including Europeans in the process of being ransomed. \n \n In March and April 2014, the women from Doctors Without Borders and a French journalist carried out three letters Mueller wrote by hand to friends and family, indicating it was finally her turn. The Doctors Without Borders women were made to memorize an ISIS email address, which the hostage takers instructed them to give to her parents. \n \n That eventually led to extraordinary negotiations for her release, the former hostages and the Mueller family said in an ABC News investigation spanning more than two years. \n \n Saide, 35, from Sweden and Chavez, 35, from Peru and Belgium, had not been publicly identified as ISIS hostages before agreeing to speak to ABC News this month about their friend, Mueller. At least six men held with them were eventually executed by the brutal \"Beatles,\" and the experience has left the women traumatized. \n \n \"Fear. It's fear of the unknown. You don't know what's going to happen,\" Chavez recalled of the state of terror in which they lived. \n \n ABC News \n \n What is now known of Mueller's 18 months of hell in ISIS hands has been drawn from the eyewitness accounts of a handful of fellow Western hostages like Saide and Chavez, who spent those six weeks with her in the spring of 2014 inside the oil refinery, as well as from the Yazidi teen who was imprisoned with Mueller in late 2014. \n \n Towards the end of Mueller's life, after her parents Carl and Marsha Mueller say the FBI and Obama administration had blocked opportunities to help them ransom their daughter, her spirit had apparently dimmed, her parents concluded after recently meeting the Yazidi girl, now 15, for the first time. \n \n Mueller was more optimistic about being freed when she briefly shared a cell with the Doctors Without Borders women in early 2014, the freed hostages said. \n \n When the three women entered Mueller's cell and met her for the first time, they said they had to get over the initial shock of finding out that Mueller was an aid worker taken with her contractor friend and two Doctors Without Borders staffers from inside a Doctors Without Borders vehicle six months earlier. The women said their colleagues had failed to disclose the incident to them before their entry into Syria. \n \n Mueller told them how she had helped her friend, Omar Alkhani, a Doctors Without Borders contractor, install satellite internet at an Aleppo Doctors Without Borders hospital, where they were invited to stay the night, and how they were then were abducted the next day from a Doctors Without Borders vehicle with two staffers as they left for a bus station on Aug. 4, 2013. \n \n Mueller's cellmates in the Raqqa oil refinery \u2014 Saide, Chavez and the third Doctors Without Borders woman, whose identity remains confidential \u2014 entered Syria in November 2013. They said that in a safety briefing, a Doctors Without Borders official did not tell them that Mueller and three Doctors Without Borders workers had been abducted. \n \n \"He said that for Doctors Without Borders, that the risk of kidnapping was not considered very big. It wasn't something that I should worry about,\" Saide told ABC News. \"Kayla had already been abducted from an Doctors Without Borders vehicle only a couple of months before that. But he failed to mention this.\" \n \n Asked about the omission, Jason Cone, the executive director of Doctors Without Borders in the U.S., told ABC News this week that he wouldn't second-guess decisions by the group's security officers three years ago. He added that Mueller's kidnapping was kept quiet for her security. \n \n \"At that time, when they went into Syria, it was the express wishes that they \u2014 that this incident not be talked about. That was deemed to be the best possible recourse,\" he said. \n \n Play \n \n He also said that the women were not traveling near Aleppo, where Mueller was kidnapped, and therefore their risk assessment was different. Saide and Chavez each dispute that claim, saying they were near Aleppo when they entered Syria from Turkey. \n \n As Mueller's fellow female hostages described it for \"20/20,\" ISIS held the four women in a 12-foot-by-12-foot room of brick whitewashed walls, in what the FBI later called the \"pipeline desert prison,\" with a blacked-out window, a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling and mattresses and blankets on the floor. They could only tell day from night through a ventilation fan near the ceiling. \n \n \"There was a little bit of light coming by this small vent, but that was it,\" Chavez said. \n \n \"It was cold, dirty. We didn't have that much to eat,\" Saide recalled. \"They gave us black dresses and hijab, so to cover our heads and faces.\" \n \n The women passed their time swapping stories of their families, their boyfriends and describing their respective homelands. They also whiled away the hours drawing, reading the Quran, writing and planning escapes that were all but impossible. Mueller sometimes cracked them up doing impressions of guards, including one brute they called \"Edges.\" \n \n And always in the background were ISIS nasheeds \u2014 chanting songs of martyrdom and death \u2014 blaring on speakers. \n \n \"They played on and on and on,\" Chavez said. \n \n The relentless nasheeds underscored the real violence of the hostage takers, which the world would see later on Aug. 19, 2014, with the first beheading on video by ISIS of an American captive, journalist James Foley. \n \n AP Photo \n \n Death threats were common and credible since a Russian captive was the first to be shot to death. \n \n \"We realized that they were actually killers, that they would enjoy killing us,\" Saide said. \n \n Mueller told the three Doctors Without Borders women in the cell about her previous six months of confinement, held mostly in isolation except for brief periods when she cared for a 14-year-old Shiite girl and another woman affiliated with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. All faced various forms of abuse by ISIS. \n \n \"She was amazing. She was a really strong girl,\" Chavez said of Mueller. \n \n For Saide, the younger Mueller at 25 years old had a surprisingly positive personality and \"a strong faith that gave her a lot of strength. As a person, she was a very good friend. She was smart. She was fun to be with. She was very kind, extremely generous.\" \n \n \"She was always considerate of others, even though she herself was in a very difficult situation,\" Saide added. \"She was always concerned for other prisoners. She never stopped being concerned for the Syrian population living through just horrible things in this war and still are. She never stopped caring for others.\" \n \n Sometimes they could hear male prisoners being severely beaten in other rooms, the women said. The Beatles would also take the Doctors Without Borders women to another room alone, shining a bright light in their faces and demanded sensitive personal information. \n \n Saide cannot forgive her former jailers, who, she said, \"caused so much pain to me and to others.\" \n \n Emwazi was killed by a CIA armed drone in Syria last year, which vaporized his car. \n \n And Daniel Rye Ottosen, the Danish freelance photographer, said Mueller and another American hostage, journalist Steven Sotloff, figured out a way to pass letters back and forth \u2014 leaving them concealed in the common toilet \u2014 creating a makeshift game of Trivial Pursuit. \n \n One day, the Doctors Without Borders women were ordered to appear in a proof-of-life video as the medical aid group negotiated their and two male staffers' release. Mueller was told by ISIS captors to stay out of the picture, the women recalled. \n \n \"They used to tell her that nobody cares about her. Like, nobody's going to negotiate for her and, you know, trying to put ideas in her mind that she is different [from] us,\" Chavez said. \n \n But in March 2014, Mueller was told by ISIS to pen two letters to her family stating the demands for her freedom: the release of convicted al-Qaeda operative Aafia Siddiqui from a U.S. federal prison or 5 million euros. She gave a third letter for her family to the Doctors Without Borders women to smuggle out. Though similarly worded, it included important personal contacts on the back, including her friend and college spiritual adviser, the Rev. Kathleen Day of Flagstaff's Northern Arizona University. \n \n Her first letter was carried out by a French journalist upon his release. And then in March it came time for Saide, Chavez and the third Doctors Without Borders woman to leave, carrying Mueller's other letters. \n \n \"She was happy that things were moving for us,\" Chavez said. \n \n Mueller buried any disappointment that no one had asked her in eight months for proof-of-life questions \u2014 an obvious sign of a negotiation effort. However, the Doctors Without Borders women were told by the Beatles to memorize an ISIS email address for the Mueller family to begin negotiations. \n \n \"It was a horrible feeling to be released, looking forward to being released but at the same time leaving someone behind,\" Saide recalled. \n \n Saide and Chavez said they hid encouraging notes in Mueller's blankets and tried to make the best of parting. The women hugged their American friend as tears flowed. Saide told her to \"stay strong,\" that it would end for her soon. But Mueller said nothing. \n \n \"I felt that I wouldn't be completely free until she was free,\" Saide said in her interview with \"20/20.\" \n \n Unbeknownst to Saide and Chavez, they said, Doctors Without Borders' Brussels office, which oversaw Syria operations, withheld the smuggled letter from Carl and Marsha Mueller until mid-April and kept secret the second, ISIS-directed letter \u2014 which included a ransom demand \u2014 and the ISIS email address until May 22. \n \n Doctors Without Borders officials have attributed the delays to their desire not to interfere with their ongoing negotiations for the release of other staffers still held by ISIS at the time. On Wednesday, the aid group issued a long statement that included the claim that \"Kayla herself asked the women not to pass along this other [ISIS-ordered] letter.\" But Saide told ABC News today that the statement by her former employer was \"not true.\" Chavez agreed, saying, \"There was no discussion where Kayla asked us not to pass it on.\" \n \n An extraordinary negotiation began with 27 emails exchanged between ISIS and the Muellers, whose FBI team composed all of the couple's notes, the family has told ABC News and which U.S. officials have confirmed. \n \n But the U.S. began airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq in early August 2014 during the negotiations for Mueller, and the terrorist group soon began beheading on video almost all the remaining Western hostages in stated retaliation soon after. \n \n Once U.S. airstrikes expanded broadly across Iraq and into Syria on Sept. 22, 2014, ISIS stopped responding to the Muellers' negotiation pleas. It is believed that by then Kayla Mueller had been handed over to the oil and gas emir for ISIS, Abu Sayyaf, and his sadistic wife, Umm Sayyaf -- Tunisians who kept the American and a half-dozen Yazidi girls as sex slaves for ISIS \"Caliph\" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \n \n Among several of the Yazidi girls enslaved alongside Mueller inside the Sayyaf household in the fall of 2014, none was closer to her than a then-13-year-old who has asked to be called \"Julia\" by ABC News. Yazidi males were subjected to mass murder by ISIS in Iraq, and thousands of Yazidi girls were forced to be sex slaves. \n \n Julia revealed in a \"20/20\" interview how Mueller \u2014 who was frequently raped by al-Baghdadi \u2014 passed up a chance at an escape in order to increase the odds for the Yazidi teens, who were able to sneak out of the ISIS kingpin's house late one night in a flight to freedom. \n \n \"I told Kayla, 'We want to escape,' and I asked her to come with us. She told me, 'No, because I am American. If I escape with you, they will do everything to find us again,'\" Julia said. \n \n \"It is better for you to escape alone. I will stay here,\" Mueller said, according to Julia. \n \n In the Sayyaf household, Mueller went by \"Kayla Carl,\" per the Muslim custom of referring to women with their father's name. All the girls, including Mueller, were beaten by the ISIS family \u2014 but Mueller also had to go to al-Baghdadi at night, as ABC News first reported last year. \n \n \"Baghdadi took her several times in the night for himself,\" Julia recounted, noting that Mueller would return later and try to not to cry, though at times she broke down. \n \n She told the girls that part of surviving was being forced to pretend she had converted to Islam so the ISIS leader could sexually assault her, though she still clung secretly to her Christian faith. \n \n \"When she was with us, she wanted to encourage us because of also what happened with us,\" Julia said, noting the girls were taken in the night by ISIS men. \"She was very tired every time. She was not crying every night, but she was very tired.\" \n \n Under a full moon, the Yazidi girls finally made their escape, parting tearfully with their older protective \"sister.\" They eventually made their way back to Irbil, in Kurdistan in northern Iraq, where Julia helped U.S. military intelligence officers find the Sayyaf houses. A Delta Force raid in May of last year resulted in Abu Sayyaf being shot to death and his wife being taken prisoner by the American operators. \n \n Mueller \"was praying for us to escape, to survive,\" said Julia, turning a bracelet on her wrist that she wears to honor Mueller. \"I will never forget this sacrifice. She was very good to us. I will never forget.\" \n \n In February 2015, ISIS claimed Mueller was killed in a Jordanian airstrike in Syria. The White House denied that an airstrike killed her but confirmed her death of unstated causes a few days after the ISIS claim. \n \n At first, Julia refused to believe her friend Mueller could be dead. \n \n Asked her reaction to the announcement on Feb. 6, 2015, Saide said simply, \"I was devastated.\" \n \n ABC News' Rhonda Schwartz, Lee Ferran, Matt McGarry, Engin Bass, Alex Hosenball, Cho Park, Esther Castillejo, Lauren Effron and Paul Shin contributed to this report. ||||| Former ISIS Captive Kayla Mueller Begs for Help in Newly Released Proof of Life Video \n \n ABC News \n \n \"My name is Kayla Mueller.

Enter the very pregnant performance artist Marni Kotak, who is transforming the Microscope Gallery into a home-birth center where she will turn the birth of her baby into a work of art. Her exhibit \"The Birth of Baby X\" kicks off her long-term project \"Raising Baby X,\" which will document her child's upbringing \"from birth through attending college and developing an independent life,\" according to her website. Starting Saturday, she'll be making the gallery home as she waits for the contractions to start (due date is uncertain according to Kotak's doctor, but some time during the span of the next 5 or 6 weeks). Then, she'll have her baby right there with the assistance of a midwife and a doula. As the 36-year-old tells us, \"I know it will be challenging, but I think if people give birth in the completely inhospitable environment of hospitals, hooked up to IVs and monitors, and strapped with stirrups into a bed, I can give birth in an art gallery.\" We dare Mark Zuckerberg to top that! We recently got to ask Kotak some questions about her project. \n \n You've reenacted the funeral of your grandfather and the first time you had sex, and you've stated that you're \"most concerned with the question of how one can have and convey a real experience.\" Can you explain how a performance art experience is different than, say, an onstage performance? A performance art experience is more real than an onstage performance if it possesses a raw immediacy that cannot be captured, and therefore cannot be acted out, as in a work of theater. \n \n In an onstage play, the performers have scripted lines that they have memorized and they are playing roles. Performance art is essentially closer to real life in that it takes place in fleeting moments that can never be repeated, objectified, or commodified. \n \n In \"The Birth of Baby X,\" I will be completely engrossed in the act of giving birth before a live audience. I will be focused on delivering my child into the world in the healthiest manner possible, rather than on how I look or what the audience may think. Everything I have learned about the birth process is that the more you surrender your mind and don't try to control the event, but let your body do what it naturally knows how to do, the better your labor progresses. This, to me, provides for the most authentic performance art situation. And the ultimate creation of this life performance will be a living being! \n \n Who are some of your influences? My biggest inspirations are the '70s performance artists like Marina Abramovic, Hannah Wilke, Chris Burden, Vito Acconci, and Carolee Schneeman, in which the performances focused on the visceral experience of the body, often testing the limits of human experience. \n \n There is a whole range of artistic practice that can be referred to as performance art. However, I feel that the best performance art takes place when the artist is not trying to perform, but is rather completely immersed in an authentic action. \n \n Most of your art performances deal with real life moments in your life. Why do you think it's so important to capture these moments -- even the mundane ones -- as art? I am driven to hold onto an authentic personal experience in a world that has essentially become consumed by an unreal hyper-reality. When I first graduated from Bard and began performing in New York in the late '90s, art was ironic and driven by semiotics and critical theory, and, with the rapid emergence of \"new media,\" the concept that reality was being replaced by a hyper-mediated simulacrum. As a young woman, I had to believe there was more to life than that. Otherwise, what was the point? I would keep saying to myself in the back of my head: \"I have to believe that this life has real meaning and value.\" \n \n If you weren't making art, what else would you be doing? Ideally, I am always making art, as my art is my life and vice versa. So, I am trying to approach every life situation from that standpoint. In that way, it almost doesn't matter what I am doing, as long as I am staying true to myself and am open to present moment unfolding. Or, in another fantasy, I could be a Russian spy, and my code name would be: Marnitov Cocktail. \n \n Do you think our culture has a fascination with chronicling our every move -- i.e., on Facebook, Twitter, etc.? Do you think it is because people want to make life seem relevant and/or meaningful? I like this question, because I have always had a deep-seated disdain for Facebook. I have an account because it seems to have become an essential communication tool of today, but I use the site solely to stay in touch with friends, who happen to use Facebook, about my upcoming shows and projects. I never log on just to post status updates or such about the details of my life. My life is for me to experience in an authentic way and not for Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the company's shareholders to make more money from. \n \n But to answer your question more directly, yes, I do feel that people today are desperately seeking a sense of meaning in their lives. Facebook is feeding into that and providing -- what I see as an ultimately empty -- solution for a hyper-mediated world. What people who spend so much time on Facebook seem to forget is that it is essentially a corporation that is profiting from the nuances of their everyday experiences. Sadly, the more time that people spend on social networking sites and the less time they spend engaging in authentic experiences with friends and family in the real world -- and yes, I do still think there is a real world -- the more they are denying the significance of their own human experience. This in turn leads to a greater sense of desperation to find meaning in their lives, more wasted hours on Facebook, and so on and so forth. It is a vicious cycle. \n \n Do you think reenacting a moment diminishes its actual value? I feel that it is never possible to re-enact a moment exactly. Although the intense nostalgia that is part of what drives my work would like it to be otherwise. I am profoundly aware that every precious moment in my life can never be re-lived, and that ultimately I will cease having life experiences. What does live on, however, are emotional residues, memories, of the original events. And so what I have tried to do in my performance re-enactments is to tap into those emotional residues and, in doing so, serve as a kind of conduit for audience members who have likely had similar or related experiences. \n \n Whatever the case, an attempt to re-enact a life event doesn't diminish its value if it is done through actually going back into what the original experience felt like. The danger is in if one tries to re-create an event by simply re-enacting a scripted set of actions. This would not pay tribute to the original experience, and would yield rather hollow results. \n \n What do you hope people take from your performance at Microscope Gallery? I hope that people will see that human life itself is the most profound work of art, and that therefore giving birth, the greatest expression of life, is the highest form of art. This child is the greatest work of art that Jason and I could ever make together. \n \n So often I find that people overlook how our lives are full of the most amazing, shocking, challenging, beautiful, and disturbing experiences -- far more interesting than anything anyone could put together as a \"performance.\" \n \n My performance at Microscope will begin as I install the show, setting up my own home-birth center in the space, and will span the entire duration of the exhibition. Part of giving birth is the mental and physical preparation for the event. A lot elements go into a traditional home-birth, and I received a whole list of necessary supplies from my midwife. I will be installing an inflatable birthing pool and a shower in the gallery, along with my deceased grandmother's bed, the rocking chair that my mother rocked me on when I was a baby, shag carpeting, a surround video projection of ocean waves crashing on the shores of my favorite Cape Cod beach, artwork made by my husband and the child's father, Jason Robert Bell, and a small kitchen area for food and drinks. \n \n All of these elements are incorporated to make the labor process as smooth and as comfortable as possible. As this will take place in front of an audience, rather than in the privacy of my home, I am doing extra mental preparation at the advice of my doula (who along with my midwife will be present at the birth) to let go of my mind and totally go into my body. She told me that once I really enter active labor the body just takes over and I won't care at all what is going on around me. My focus will be on having my baby. I know it will be challenging, but I think if people give birth in the completely inhospitable environment of hospitals, hooked up to IVs and monitors and strapped with stirrups into a bed, I can give birth in an art gallery. And in giving birth in front of the audience, I am showing them, as in my previous performances, that real life is the best performance art, and that, if our eyes can be opened to it, all of the meaning that we seek is right there in our everyday lives. \n \n \"The Birth of Baby X\" opens Saturday, October 8, through Monday, November 7 at Microscope Gallery, 4 Charles Place, Bushwick. The hours are extended to 7 days a week, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and, the gallery says, \"we will remain open or reopen if the birth is in process.\" Visitors to the show can get on a list be notified of when she goes into labor.

The revered fashion icon, who custom-designed Anne Hathaway's wedding gown and considers her a friend, naturally expected the Les Miserables actress to wear one of his designs to the Oscars on Feb. 24, where she ultimately won her first Academy Award. His team even sent out a press release late in the afternoon on Sunday, just hours before red carpet arrivals began, announcing that the Best Supporting Actress frontrunner would be wearing \"a pink embroidered tulle illusion gown.\" The release also stated that one of the night's most anticipated presenters, Jennifer Aniston, would be wearing a \"nude embroidered silk tulle dress.\" \n \n PHOTOS: See what the stars wore to the Oscars! \n \n Neither, of course, ended up in those two gowns at the event. \n \n Instead, the Les Miserables star opted to go with the Prada column dress that sparked the infamous \"are they darts or nipples?\" debate.

They informed us that Naomi's blood counts were consistent with Leukemia. They scheduled a bone marrow biopsy for this morning at 9am to verify the diagnosis and determine treatment.

It is more aggressive than other kinds and will require 6-9 mo of intensive therapy in the hospital.

I\u2019m very diligent about my skin and my routine takes more time. However when it comes to makeup, as I get older, I think less is more. Often on RHOBH I would wear more makeup and fake lashes. I would always watch the show and think it actually made me look older, so I made a point to wear less.

    "document": "China has suspended imports of shellfish from the west coast of the United States -- an unprecedented move that cuts off a $270 million Northwest industry from its biggest export market. \n \n China said it decided to impose the ban after recent shipments of geoduck clams from Northwest waters were found by its own government inspectors to have high levels of arsenic and a toxin that causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. \n \n The restriction took effect last week and China's government says it will continue indefinitely. It applies to clams, oysters and all other two-shelled bivalves harvested from the waters of Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Northern California. U.S. officials think the contaminated clams were harvested in Washington or Alaska. Right now they\u2019re waiting to hear back from Chinese officials for more details that will help them identify the exact source. \n \n State and federal agencies oversee inspection and certification to prevent the shipment of tainted shellfish. Jerry Borchert of the Washington Department of Health said he's never encountered such a ban based on the Chinese government's assertion that these U.S. safeguards failed to screen out contaminated seafood. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve never done anything like that, where they would not allow shellfish from this entire area based on potentially two areas or maybe just one area. We don\u2019t really know yet,\u201d Borchert said. \n \n The biggest blow could fall to those who farm or harvest the supersized geoduck clams. In the Northwest, they're concentrated in Washington's Puget Sound, where about 5 million pounds of wild geoduck are harvested each year. Aquaculture accounts for an additional 2 million pounds, according to estimates from the Washington Department of Natural Resources. \n \n A barricade around the Chinese consumer market means trouble for those in the Northwest who rely on Asian trade. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s had an incredible impact,\u201d said George Hill, the geoduck harvest coordinator for Puget Sound's Suquamish Tribe. \u201cA couple thousand divers out of work right now.\u201d \n \n The U.S. exported $68 million worth of geoduck clams in 2012 -- most of which came from Puget Sound. Nearly 90 percent of that geoduck went to China. \n \n Geoduck are highly prized in China, where the clams sell for retail prices of $100 to $150 per pound. Although geoduck are harvested year round, demand peaks during the holiday season leading up to the Chinese celebration of the lunar new year -- which falls on Jan. 31 for 2014. \n \n The geoduck (pronounced \"GOO-ee-duck\") is a the world\u2019s largest burrowing clam. It\u2019s slow-growing, regularly reaching 100 years old and often weighing as much as 10 pounds. \n \n Harvesters are waiting for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to negotiate with the Chinese government to come to an agreement on how to move forward and reopen shellfish trade. NOAA stopped issuing certification for shellfish exports last Friday. \n \n Officials say the investigation is ongoing but the closure could last for months. While the industry awaits a resolution at the international level, it is adjusting to the new reality. \n \n The Suquamish Tribe is trying to develop other markets in New York, California and locally at seafood markets in Seattle, Hill said. \n \n Bill Dewey, a spokesman for the largest shellfish supplier in Washington said his company, Taylor Shellfish, is looking at other solutions. \n \n \"I was just talking to our geoduck manager and he\u2019s got two harvest crews and three beach crews essentially doing makework,\" Dewey said. \"He\u2019s too nice a guy to lay them off during the holidays but there\u2019s only so much you can be charitable about making work for people and eventually you\u2019re going to have to lay them off.\u201d \n \n ||||| Originally published December 14, 2013 at 8:20 PM | Page modified December 15, 2013 at 3:21 PM \n \n Washington geoduck farmers and harvesters have turned to politicians to help overturn a Chinese shellfish-import ban that\u2019s all but shut down the local industry. \n \n Washington geoduck harvesters and government officials, including Gov. Jay Inslee, are scrambling to overturn China\u2019s decision to ban some shellfish exports from the Pacific Northwest. \n \n The ban has brought the geoduck industry here to a virtual halt. \n \n Fish inspectors in China notified the U.S. Embassy on Dec. 3 that China was tentatively suspending imports of geoduck and other \u201cdouble-shell aquatic animals,\u201d such as oysters, because they found high levels of paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, in a Nov. 21 shipment of geoducks. \n \n PSP is a biotoxin produced by algae that shellfish eat and, in humans, in high levels it can lead to severe illness and even death. \n \n KUOW first reported news of the ban. \n \n The ban is a particularly nettlesome problem in Washington because China accounts for about 90 percent of geoduck exports from the state. And fisheries in the state harvest and farm 5.5 million to 7 million pounds of geoduck annually, according to Taylor Shellfish Farms, one of the state\u2019s largest geoduck providers. Those companies generally sell geoduck, which is a burrowing clam, for between $7 and $25 a pound. \n \n The ban also affects Alaskan shellfish. \n \n Local fish companies, though, are struggling to understand the ban because testing by the Washington State Department of Health in the area where the geoduck shipments originated found PSP levels well below internationally accepted limits. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back and looked at all records \u2014 they show results way below any human-health concern,\u201d Donn Moyer, a health-department spokesman, said Saturday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence or information whatsoever about any high levels of PSP in any shellfish.\u201d \n \n Geoduck harvesters believe the Chinese inspectors applied a standard for the level of toxicity that is well below what is considered safe for humans. \n \n \u201cThe numbers I saw (that Chinese inspectors used) are just plain ridiculous,\u201d said Tony Forsman, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, a business run by the Suquamish Tribe. \n \n To compound the challenge, communication from the Chinese government has been scant. State regulators and fishery executives say they have heard nothing more from the Chinese since the Dec. 3 notification. Press officials from the Chinese embassy in Washington didn\u2019t respond to an email query Saturday. \n \n That\u2019s led the industry to turn to political leaders to resolve the issue. On Friday, the governor and Commissioner of Public Lands Peter Goldmark sent a letter to the heads of the Food and Drug Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asking them to engage in \u201cdirect interaction with the Chinese government\u201d to determine the status of the ban and to gather information about the Chinese inspection. \n \n In the meantime, local geoduck harvesters and farmers are curtailing operations. Suquamish Seafoods, which sends all of its geoduck, between $2 million and $3 million a year, to China, has idled its 24 divers. \n \n \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Forsman. \u201cThe tribe really depends on it.\u201d \n \n Taylor Shellfish Farms, which sells some geoduck domestically, has had to reduce hours for its workers. And if the Chinese ban continues much longer, prices for geoduck sold domestically will drop because of a market glut. \n \n \u201cThat may have an impact on domestic prices,\u201d said Bill Dewey, Taylor\u2019s director of public policy and communications. \n \n Staff reporter Carol M. Ostrom contributed to this report. Jay Greene: 206-464-2231 or jgreene@seattletimes.com. Twitter: iamjaygreene",

Like the fact that we've inherited some Neanderthal DNA, so apparently our ancestors mated with them. Now there's new research from DNA that moves on from paleo-mating to paleo-eating. \n \n About 10,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers in the Near East figured out how to grow cereal crops like wheat. The farming culture spread, and wherever it went, people traded in their spears for plows. \n \n That's the conventional view. Apparently, it was more complicated than that. \n \n Evidence comes from archaeologists who've been digging into Bouldnor Cliff, a submerged prehistoric site off the coast of the Isle of Wight, in the south of Great Britain. They found tools, burned nutshells and animal remains and worked wood. \n \n \"We sort of got the lunch spot of this boat-building workshop 8,000 years ago,\" says Robin Allaby, a molecular archaeologist at the University of Warwick in England. \n \n He says even though the locals could build boats, they were still hunter-gatherers. Agriculture didn't take off in Britain for another 2,000 years. \n \n And yet he found DNA from cultivated wheat along with the lunchtime paraphernalia. He didn't find any wheat pollen at all, so it wasn't grown there. In fact, there's never been evidence that wheat was cultivated in Britain earlier than about 6,000 years ago. \n \n i itoggle caption Courtesy of Roland Brookes Courtesy of Roland Brookes \n \n Which meant the Brits must have been getting wheat from someone else, grown somewhere else. \n \n Writing in the journal Science, Allaby says that apparently Stone Age Britons weren't isolated on their little island. It seems they were getting their wheat from Europe, where agriculture had already established itself. \n \n \"They were perfectly happy with using the products of agriculture,\" he says, \"but they didn't actually start farming themselves. They were interacting with the farmers some ways away, contributing to this process [of creating a Neolithic agricultural society], which is not the conventional view.\" \n \n He suspects that farmers from what is now France established a regular wheat trade across the English Channel, which was narrower and shallower at the time. Which meant that the Stone Age Brits could have their cake and eat it, too. ||||| OSLO Stone Age Britons imported wheat about 8,000 years ago in a surprising sign of sophistication for primitive hunter-gatherers long viewed as isolated from European agriculture, a study showed on Thursday. \n \n British scientists found traces of wheat DNA in a Stone Age site off the south coast of England near the Isle of Wight, giving an unexpected sign of contact between ancient hunter-gatherers and farmers who eventually replaced them. \n \n The wheat DNA was dated to 8,000 years ago, 2,000 years before Stone Age people in mainland Britain started growing cereals and 400 years before farming reached what is now northern Germany or France, they wrote in the journal Science. \n \n \"We were surprised to find wheat,\" co-author Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick told Reuters of finds at Bouldnor Cliff. \n \n \"This is a smoking gun of cultural interaction,\" between primitive hunter-gatherers in Britain and farmers in Europe, he said of the findings in the journal Science. \n \n \"It will upset archaeologists. The conventional view of Britain at the time was that it was cut off,\" he said. \"We can only speculate how they got wheat -- it could have been trade, a gift or stolen.\" \n \n The scientists also found DNA of oak, poplar and beech and of dogs or wolves, deer, grouse and auroch, a type of cow. There was no trace of wheat pollen in the samples, indicating that it was not grown locally. \n \n The scientists found the DNA at what was apparently a pre-historic site for boat building. The sediments are now 11.5 metres (38 feet) below sea level. \n \n Britain used to be connected by land to Europe during the Ice Age but melting icecaps pushed seas higher about 10,000 years ago. A land bridge may have lingered 8,000 years ago. \n \n Farming reaching the Balkans about 8-9,000 years ago from the Middle East and eventually spread throughout Europe. \n \n Greger Larson, an American archaeologist at Oxford University who was not involved in the study, praised the experts for extensive checks to ensure against mis-interpretation or contamination of DNA. \n \n The find of wheat \"will make us re-evaluate the relationships between farmers and hunter-gatherers,\" he told Reuters. \n \n He said there has been other signs of contacts, including bones of domesticated pigs in Germany in Stone Age hunter-gatherer settlements. \"There are trade networks that pre-date agriculture,\" he said. \n \n (Reporting By Alister Doyle)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists studying a Stone Age site in Britain came across something that by all rights shouldn't have been there: wheat. More specifically, the researchers found the DNA of wheat dating back 8,000 years off the coast of the Isle of Wight, reports Reuters. That's about 2,000 years before ancient Brits began growing it, but scientists don't think this means that hunter-gatherers in the region were farming earlier than thought. In fact, the lack of wheat pollen at the site suggests it wasn't cultivated there at all. Instead, the scientists say it shows that these old inhabitants were in contact with farmers elsewhere in Europe and participating in a heretofore unknown \"international wheat trade,\" reports the BBC. \"This is a smoking gun of cultural interaction,\" says a co-author of the study in Science. \"The conventional view of Britain at the time was that it was cut off,\" but the find very much suggests otherwise. \"We can only speculate how they got wheat\u2014it could have been trade, a gift, or stolen.\" The best guess is that the wheat came from farmers in what is now France, reports NPR.

Hopefully, the headlines will be as big for this part of the story,\" the co-worker said. \n \n ANALYSIS: KELLY STILL HAS A FUTURE IN TV \n \n The accuser's mother, visibly angry at what she called the media's \"slander\" of \"an innocent woman,\" told a Daily News reporter seeking comment at her Port Washington, L.I., home that she would call the cops. \n \n \n \n \"In this town (they) do what they're supposed to do,\" she said pointedly, slamming her door. \n \n \n \n The accuser, a 28-year-old paralegal, walked into Manhattan's 13th Precinct stationhouse on Jan. 24 with a bombshell statement. She told police she had gone drinking Oct. 8 at a South Street Seaport bar with Kelly, a 43-year-old former Marine Harrier jet pilot, and then took him to her law offices, where she says he raped her. \n \n \n \n She said she got pregnant from the encounter and had an abortion. The woman's boyfriend angrily confronted Raymond Kelly about his son at a public event before she made her statement to prosecutors. \n \n \n \n The NYPD immediately handed the case to Vance's office. Her accusation was problematic, not just because three months had passed, but because the woman had sent Kelly flirtatious and friendly messages both before and after the encounter. \n \n \n \n Investigators interviewed both Greg Kelly and his accuser, reviewed bar receipts, security logs, text messages and telephone records \u2014 and concluded no crime occurred, Bashford said. It was a significant legal step beyond saying the allegations could not be proved. \n \n \n \n Under state law, rape is defined as sexual intercourse without consent, either due to force, fear or impairment. \n \n \n \n Vance spokeswoman Joan Vollero said the DA will not bring a false reporting charge against the woman. \n \n \n \n Bashford's letter said both the woman and Kelly were interviewed early on and both were cooperative. Sources said the woman's story remained consistent throughout: She believed she was too drunk to consent to sex. \n \n \n \n Lawyer Paul Callan, who represented Channel 7 meteorologist Heidi Jones when she was charged with making false rape claims, said he thought Kelly's accuser had no standing to file a civil suit against Kelly \u2014 but suggested Kelly could sue her for defamation. \n \n \n \n However, he said, \"the chances of him bringing a lawsuit are zero, unless he wants his entire sexual history with women discussed in the New York press.\" \n \n \n \n Commissioner Kelly declined to comment on his son being cleared. \n \n \n \n Greg Kelly, who had not been on the air or seen in public since the accusation became public on Jan. 25, is expected to discuss his return to TV with Channel 5 brass on Wednesday, sources said. \n \n \n \n In his statement, he thanked his family, his viewers and his co-host, Rosanna Scotto, for their support. \n \n \n \n \"I will always remember her kindness, and I look forward to soon resuming my post on \u2018Good Day New York' next to her,\" Kelly said. \"I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and friends whose support for me never wavered,\" he said. \n \n \n \n Channel 5 insiders said that at a staff meeting last week, news director Dianne Doctor said she expected huge ratings when Kelly returned to the air. \n \n \n \n \"I think there will be a ratings bump when or if he returns,\" one staffer said, \"and then it will be back to business covering crime, politics and Snooki and JWoww's new show in Jersey.\" \n \n \n \n One insider wondered how Kelly's on-air chemistry with Scotto may change. Before the allegations, Scotto had been the family person in the relationship, often joking about trying to get Kelly dates. \n \n \n \n \"Will he change his demeanor?\" asked a source. \"They always tease him as being the single guy hanging out and having fun.\" \n \n \n \n With Vera Chinese, Rocco Parascandola and Barbara Ross \n \n \n \n mgrace@nydailynews.com ||||| TV anchor Greg Kelly will not be charged in the case of a woman who accused him of rape.

After drinking for a few hours that night, they decided to head to the Financial District law office where the victim worked. \n \n There, she claimed, Kelly sexually assaulted her while she was virtually passed out. \n \n But the pair later exchanged text messages, saying that they had a good time and discussing getting together again, according to sources. \n \n The alleged victim came forward after she told her boyfriend about the claims and he became enraged. \n \n He later confronted the police commissioner at a public event and said that his son had ruined his girlfriend's life. \n \n The victim also told investigators that she became pregnant as a result of the alleged attack and had an abortion, sources said. \n \n After the allegations surfaced, Greg Kelly vehemently maintained his innocence, but took a leave of absence from his show on Fox 5. \n \n His father refused to answer questions about the incident. \n \n The mayor's office declined to comment on the case Tuesday night. \n \n Fox 5 did not immediately respond to calls and emails for comment Tuesday. \n \n Additional reporting by Murray Weiss",

The 29-year-old woman accused the Good Day New York co-host of assaulting her after a night of drinking in lower Manhattan. \"After reviewing the evidence, we have determined that the facts established during our investigation do not fit the definitions of sexual assault crimes under New York criminal law,\" said the chief of the DA's sex crimes unit in a letter to Kelly's lawyer. \"Therefore, no criminal charges are appropriate.\" Kelly, who took a leave of absence from his Fox 5 show after the allegations surfaced, said in a statement: \"I am thankful that the investigation established what I've known all along, that I am innocent of the allegations that were waged against me. I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and friends whose support for me never wavered.\"",

Damage could rise as high as $310 billion, the government said, making it the most costly natural disaster on record. \n \n The total death toll from the disaster could rise much higher as the National Police Agency said more than 17,400 people are still missing. Those tallies may overlap, but police from one of the hardest-hit prefectures, Miyagi, estimate that the deaths will top 15,000 in that region alone. \n \n Japan has been grappling with an avalanche of miseries that began with the March 11 quake, which ravaged the northeastern coast and damaged the critical cooling system at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, located 140 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo. \n \n As operators of the Fukushima plant struggled to get the cooling system operating again, radiation has seeped into the air and water, stoking fears about the safety of Japan's food and water supply. Radiation has been found in raw milk, seawater and 11 kinds of vegetables, including broccoli, cauliflower and turnips, grown in areas around the plant. \n \n Radioactive iodine is short-lived, with a half-life of eight days _ the length of time it takes for half of it to break down harmlessly. However, experts say infants are particularly vulnerable to radioactive iodine, which can cause thyroid cancer. \n \n The U.S. and Australia have halted imports of Japanese dairy and produce from the region, Hong Kong said it would require that Japan perform safety checks on meat, eggs and seafood, and Canada said it would upgrade controls on imports of Japanese food products. Singapore, too, has banned the sale of milk, produce, meat and seafood from areas near the plant. \n \n In Tokyo, residents stripped store shelves of bottled water and some other basic necessities after authorities said radioactive iodine in the tap water was more than twice what is considered safe for babies to drink. \n \n \"The first thought was that I need to buy bottles of water,\" said Reiko Matsumoto, a real estate agent and mother of a 5-year-old, who rushed to a nearby store to stock up on supplies. \"I also don't know whether I can let her take a bath.\" \n \n Tests conducted Thursday showed the levels in the city's water fell to acceptable limits for infants, but shot up in neighboring regions. \n \n In Tokyo, government spokesman Yukio Edano pleaded for calm over the water contamination, and said the government was considering importing bottled water from other countries to cover any shortages. Officials urged residents to avoid panicked stockpiling and the city distributed bottled waters to families with infants. \n \n New readings Thursday showed the city's tap water was back to levels acceptable for infants, but the relief was tempered by elevated levels of the isotope in two neighboring prefectures: Chiba and Saitama. A city in a third prefecture, just south of the plant, also showed high levels of radioactive iodine in tap water, officials said. \n \n Tap water in Kawaguchi City in Saitama, north of Tokyo, contained 210 becquerels of radioactive iodine _ well above the 100 becquerels considered safe for babies but below the 300-becquerel level for adults, Health Ministry official Shogo Misawa said. \n \n In Chiba prefecture, the water tested high for radiation in two separate areas, said water safety official Kyoji Narita. The government there warned families in 11 cities in Chiba not to give infants tap water. \n \n \"The high level of iodine was due to the nuclear disaster,\" Narita said. \"There is no question about it.\" \n \n Radiation levels also tested dangerously high in Hitachi in Ibaraki prefecture, about 70 miles (120 kilometers) south of the Fukushima plant, city water official Toshifumi Suzuki said. \n \n In Fukushima, plant operators were still struggling to get the cooling system operating again. Lighting was restored Thursday to the central control room at Unit 1 for the first time since the tsunami, but two workers were treated at a hospital after stepping into radiation-contaminated water. \n \n The water seeped over the top of their boots and onto their legs, said Takashi Kurita, spokesman for plant owner Tokyo Electric Power Co. \n \n The men will be transferred to a radiology medical institute Friday, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, another nuclear agency spokesman. Their injuries were not life-threatening. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi, Elaine Kurtenbach and Yuri Kageyama contributed to this report. ||||| At a downtown grocery store, a line of anxious mothers cleaned the shelves of bottled water seven minutes after the doors opened. At an organic farm on the city\u2019s outskirts, a group tested spinach with a hand-held radiation detector. And at the prime minister\u2019s headquarters, the chief cabinet secretary announced that Japan is considering importing drinking water. \n \n As emergency crews battled Thursday to contain nuclear fallout from the earthquake-hit Fukushima Daiichi power plant in northeast Japan, a nervous uncertainty spread as far away as Tokyo, 150 miles to the southwest, as radiation was reported in parts of the food chain and millions tried to understand the implications. \n \n In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported Thursday that Japanese scientists have found \u201cmeasurable concentrations\u201d of radioactive iodine-131 and cesium-137 in samples of seawater collected off the Fukushima prefecture coast. \n \n \u201cThe iodine concentrations were at or above Japanese regulatory limits, and the cesium levels were well below those limits,\u201d the IAEA said on its Web site. The samples were gathered Tuesday and Wednesday at several points 18.6 miles from shore, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said. \n \n A day after Tokyo officials warned of elevated iodine levels in the city\u2019s tap water and the national government restricted shipment of 11 leafy vegetables in several prefectures, residents scrambled to stock up on the essentials, which are now in short supply. \n \n Tokyo officials distributed 240,000 bottles of water to households with infants, who are more vulnerable to radioactive iodine-131. The U.S. Embassy handed out to American citizens potassium iodide pills, which can block radioactive iodine from building up in the thyroid gland. \n \n \u201cIf the situation isn\u2019t better in one week, I actually might have to move in with my parents,\u201d said Yuki Ochiai, 32, mother of an 8-month-old girl who was among two dozen customers in line at the Tokyu grocery store 20 minutes before it opened. \u201cMy husband is already encouraging me to leave.\u201d \n \n As residents fretted, the number of deaths from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami officially topped 10,000, the National Police Agency said Friday. More than 17,000 people remain missing. \n \n Two weeks after the quake, Japan Prime Minister Naoto Kan is scheduled to address the nation at 7:30 p.m. Friday, his spokesman said. \n \n Meanwhile, the struggle to prevent more radiation from escaping the nuclear plant continued. Engineers hooked up lighting to a control room at the unit 1 reactor Thursday \u2014 an incremental, but hopeful, step toward cooling overheated spent fuel rods. At the unit 3 reactor, workers prepared to test a cooling pump that would allow them to pour in fresh rainwater instead of less effective seawater. \n \n But there were setbacks. Three workers suffered radiation burns after stepping in contaminated water while attempting to lay electrical wiring at one of the buildings. Two of the workers, exposed to 170 to 180 millisieverts of radiation, were hospitalized, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, who did not disclose the status of the third employee. The Associated Press quoted Fumio Matsuda, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, as saying that radiation levels of 170 to 180 millisieverts were well below the maximum 250 millisieverts allowed for workers. \n \n Officials said Friday they are investigating possible damage to the reactor vessel at unit 3 that could be allowing dangerous radiation to leak into the atmosphere. \n \n Government authorities said they are analyzing the reactor\u2019s vessel, pipes and valves for potential damage that could be causing a leak. That reactor is considered particularly dangerous because it is the only one that burns mox fuel, a combination of plutonium and uranium that is hotter than conventional uranium reactors. \n \n \u201cLooking at the data, we believe the No. 3 vessel still has the capacity to contain radioactive material,\u201d Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said at a news conference. \u201cBut we have to investigate \u2026 the possibility the No. 3 reactor has sustained damage.\u201d \n \n The setback is the latest in a fitful effort to contain nuclear fallout at the Daiichi power plant. Crews have attached power cables to try to restore electricity, but only two of the six facility\u2019s six reactors have successfully been put into cold shutdown. Twice this week, workers were evacuated after smoke was seen rising from the buildings, though officials later said the smoke was caused by steam that is not harmful. \n \n The nervous uncertainty over the food chain Thursday sent people sifting through information about the complicated and rapidly changing problem. In Chiba and Saitama, two prefectures neighboring Tokyo, officials discovered iodine levels exceeding the legal limit for infants. Yet Tokyo\u2019s water, which had tested high a day earlier, showed a decrease Thursday. \n \n For some, the brief water warning was a tipping point, a sign that the environment had become a threat. At the Tokyu grocery, an employee opened the store doors at 10 a.m. and a half-dozen pregnant women and young mothers rushed to the far aisle. \n \n Within seven minutes, all 80 two-liter bottles were gone. Ochiai, cradling her daughter, held two of them. Her parents, who live in Hokkaido, a northern island, were sending 12 more bottles of water by airmail, she said. \n \n \u201cI actually feel sorry standing here with my two bottles of water,\u201d Ochiai said. \u201cAll these other mothers are here now, and they are too late.\u201d \n \n As parents worried about supply, farmers brooded over the demand for their food, tainted by the government\u2019s advisory that residents not eat 11 leafy vegetables grown in prefectures near the Daiichi facility, citing elevated levels of radioactive materials in them. \n \n The advisory has left farmers nationwide wondering about the effect on their livelihood as consumers weigh the risks. \n \n At a spinach farm in Chiba, about 11 / 2 hours outside Tokyo, the proprietor, Masayuki Kumate, 45, looked on as Sumito Hatta, a food researcher, used a dosimeter to take a radioactivity reading of a lone row of green plants sprouting from the dark brown soil. \n \n Kumate shook his head. Although Chiba officials had not banned any produce, Kumate said he has \u201cbeen worried since Day One\u201d of the disaster. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s so clear what was going to happen,\u201d he said of the nuclear fallout. \u201cFor Fukushima farmers, it is impossible [to recover]. The soil is contaminated. They will have to get rid of that before they start again. It takes a very long time. It will be a very big problem.\u201d \n \n Hatta and a friend, Shinya Takeda, started a blog and a Facebook page dedicated to informing the Japanese people and the world about the plight facing Japan\u2019s farmers and asking for donations. \n \n Japan\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries sent a letter to banks this week encouraging them to provide loans to farmers seeking to rebuild. And the government has pledged that the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the nuclear plant, will provide stipends to farmers whose crops have been contaminated. \n \n \u201cThe farmlands that were soaked with saltwater will not be revived as farmland,\u201d the Facebook page reads. \u201cThis reality is another destruction for the farmers. . . . Now people in Japan are buying up all food at supermarkets and oil at gas stations due to the anxiety. Our food sovereignty is in great danger.\u201d \n \n Special correspondents Akiko Yamamoto and Kyoko Tanaka contributed to this report.",

She cited the Trump administration's reversal of guidelines that transgender students nationwide should be able to use school bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity \u2014 among other steps. \n \n \"These actions invite increased discrimination and continued animus against transgender people,\" Gordon said. \n \n Federal prosecutor Julia Gegenheimer had said at Vallum's plea hearing in December that he began planning to kill Williamson after a friend called him in May 2015 to say he'd discovered Williamson's identity. \n \n Vallum lured Williamson into a car in Alabama and drove her 50 miles (80 kilometers) to his family home near Lucedale, Mississippi, prosecutors said. They added he shocked her with a stun gun and stabbed her with a pocketknife. When Williamson tried to run, they said, Vallum chased her and bashed her head with a hammer. \n \n Public defenders submitted a sealed brief Monday to Guirola outlining Vallum's troubles. \n \n \"Mr. Vallum lived through a childhood that was characterized by abandonment and neglect,\" said public defender Ellen Allred. \"It's difficult to image how a mother could lock a two- or three-year-old child in a room for house on end while adults did drugs.\" \n \n Allred said Vallum first tried to kill himself when he was 7 or 8. \n \n \"We can't go back and change Mr. Vallum's childhood, just like Mr. Vallum can't go back and undo what he did to Mercedes,\" Allred said. \n \n Vallum initially told sheriff's deputies and later told The Sun Herald newspaper that he found out that Williamson had a penis on May 30, 2015 \u2014 moments before he killed her. He said he \"blacked out\" and doesn't remember the crime, a variation of what's known as a \"gay panic\" or \"trans panic\" defense. \n \n He declined to speak with The Associated Press in a March letter, citing advice from his lawyers, and didn't address the issue Monday. However, Vallum has never contested testimony and evidence that he long knew Williamson was transgender. \n \n A witness in state court had testified previously that Vallum and Williamson had sex multiple times while the witness was a roommate with Williamson. Williamson had transitioned from male to female before dropping out of high school in Alabama, leaving her parents' home and drifting from place to place. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Jeff Amy at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy .

    "document": "In this May 27, 2013 photo released by the National Weather Service, the ice jam on the Yukon River at Bishop Rock is shown in Galena, Alaska. Several hundred people are estimated to have fled the community... (Associated Press) \n \n A colossal river ice jam that caused major flooding in a remote Alaska town was starting to churn Wednesday as water finally chewed ice chunks away from the stubborn, frozen mass after most of the residents were forced to flee from the rising water. \n \n An aerial survey Wednesday afternoon revealed chunks of ice have broken off at the front of the 30-mile (50-kilometer) ice jam on the Yukon River, National Weather Service hydrologist Ed Plumb said. That means the jam will move soon and waters will begin to recede in the waterlogged town of Galena. \n \n The flooding lifted homes off foundations and has threatened to break a dike protecting the airport, virtually the only dry spot left in the community of 500 where floodwaters washed out roads and submerged homes. There are no reports of injuries. \n \n The National Guard flew 32 more people and 19 dogs to Fairbanks Tuesday night. Other residents were evacuated earlier. \n \n Now that the water is trying to push through the jam, conditions could change quickly. When the jam breaks, the downriver community of Koyukuk will be at risk of flooding. \n \n In an earlier flight Wednesday, Plumb said, the ice was locked firmly in place, despite temperatures of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius). The hot weather is expected to last a couple days before cooling slightly. \n \n The damage has left the town without power, fresh water and cell phone reception. When the ice jam knocked out the bridge leading to the airport, evacuees had to be taken there by boat or helicopter, according to Ray, who said the flooding began with a trickle Sunday. In a place where spring flooding is nothing new, many homes are built on stilts, but the fast rising water reached them, too. \n \n The disaster has left people feeling traumatized and vulnerable, Ray said. \n \n \"We didn't have any idea how vast the flood was going to be,\" he said. \n \n Zidek said the damage is being assessed and a disaster policy cabinet will forward recommendations to Gov. Sean Parnell, who visited the area Tuesday. Recommendations are likely to include issuing a disaster declaration. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Rachel D'Oro at _https://twitter.com/rdoro ||||| Lookouts stood high on Koyukuk Mountain Wednesday, watching the Yukon River below with binoculars and hunting scopes. \n \n \"We're looking at a flash flood. Something like a dam breaking,\" said Koyukuk Mayor Patrick Madros. \n \n Koyukuk sits about 14 miles downriver from the ice jam that caused massive flooding and a near-complete evacuation of Galena this week. It's the latest community to put life on hold as the annual river breakup winds down the Yukon. \n \n The ice dam began flooding Galena on Sunday and by Wednesday an estimated 300 or more people had fled by plane to Fairbanks, Anchorage or other villages. The local school district estimated 30 to 40 people stayed behind, camping with their dogs at the airport, taking shelter in former Air Force barracks and eating military-style \"meals ready to eat.\" \n \n The jam showed signs of weakening by 11 a.m. Wednesday, and by 5 p.m. the Weather Service reported that part of the dam had peeled away. It was still blocking the river, but water levels had already began rising downstream, the agency said. \n \n The Weather Service expected the jam to break and water to began draining from Galena by late Wednesday or Thursday. When it does, a surge of water was expected to flood Koyukuk, where the service has issued a flood warning through 4 p.m. Thursday. \n \n The damage to Galena has been devastating, said Weather Service hydrologist Ed Plumb. \n \n Plumb has been stationed in Galena, where a dike surrounding the airport and a few government buildings has created a dry \"island\" in the middle of bobbing ice and debris. \n \n \"There's a lot of cars that are totally submerged in water and floating around,\" Plumb said. \"There are houses that are totally submerged in water up to the roof.\" \n \n \"You can see sheens of fuel across the floodwaters and spilled fuel tanks,\" Plumb said. Water inundated the sewage lagoon, which \"is just part of the flood now,\" he said. \n \n There is no power in the village, no working bathrooms and limited food. \"All we've had is the shirt on our backs,\" Plumb said. \n \n The flooding began with a few fingers of water covering the roads, said Paul Apfelbeck, a teacher. Sometime on Monday afternoon it began to surge, seemingly climbing by a foot at a time. It sounded like Niagara Falls, he said. \n \n \"People were scrambling all over the neighborhood, putting their cars up on higher ground.\" \n \n Apfelbeck flew to Fairbanks late Tuesday on an Alaska Air National Guard HC-130. The plane carried 32 people and 19 dogs. Alaska State Troopers flew another six people and seven pets to Fairbanks at about the same time. \n \n Some Galena residents, including schools superintendent Chris Reitan, said the state waited too long to help with widespread evacuations given the alarming surge of flood waters Monday night. No one has been killed or reported missing. Nearly every home in town has been damaged, residents said. \n \n Gov. Sean Parnell visited Galena Tuesday and members of his cabinet met Wednesday to discuss whether the state should declare a disaster emergency, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesman for the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. \n \n A disaster declaration could unlock state relief money for the village, he said. The state Emergency Management team in Galena asked for additional supplies for those remaining in the community, including 10 cases of bottled water and 12 cases of MREs. \n \n In Koyukuk, a Koyukon Athabascan community about 30 miles downriver, residents were already preparing for the worst, Madros said. \n \n They hauled water and wood to higher ground. They prepared to shut the power off in the town of about 75 people and evacuated the sick and elderly Tuesday on a plane to Fairbanks. Madros, the mayor, stood on flood watch from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n \"This is the worst flood we've ever seen in Galena so we're expecting a lot of water once that dam breaks to come this way,\" he said. \n \n The Weather Service expects the surge to take about four hours to reach Koyukuk once the ice jam breaks. The water will arrive in a wave, the flood warning says. \n \n Twitter updates: twitter.com/adn_kylehopkins.

CBS Los Angeles reports that Stephanie Smith, who describes herself as a real estate developer by way of Boston College and UCLA, was accused of running a weed \"fortress\" from three San Bernardino buildings. \n \n In January, she said she was just the owner of the properties, insisting her tenants' activities were legal under California law. \n \n Smith, the owner of a business called Bubba Likes Tortillas, said in the lawsuit filed Friday in San Bernardino County Superior Court that the city's new law could create monopolies and also prevent her from renting property to pot growers and other marijuana operations. \n \n The dispute dates back to December when a fortified building Smith owns was raided, cultivation operations her clients were operating were shut down and 35,000 marijuana plants were seized. Smith was not involved with pot growing and she was not arrested or charged, her attorney Ben Eilenberg said. \n \n After the raids, a judge invalidated a voter-approved measure to regulate marijuana operations and San Bernardino City Council passed its own measure to replace it earlier this month. \n \n At the time, CBS Los Angeles reported her attorney released a statement which read, in part: \"As a professional real estate developer with several million square feet of commercial and industrial space throughout California, I provide the infrastructure for all types of industry to operate and prosper, including the cannabis industry.

A telephone number for Smith could not be located in public records. \n \n San Bernardino Police Dept./CBS News \n \n Police and federal investigators raided two other properties owned by Smith and seized 18,000 pounds of marijuana in total. Eight people who were working in the warehouse in downtown San Bernardino were detained by police, but no charges have been filed in the case, Madden said. \n \n California voters have approved the legalization of marijuana, but growers must receive licenses and permits from local governments and the state. Recreational pot sales start in California on Jan. 1, joining the long-running medical cannabis industry. \n \n \"Marijuana has been legalized, but there are stringent requirements,\" Madden said. \"It's not that you just get to set up shop where you want to set up.\" \n \n The Los Angeles City Council voted Dec. 6 to license sales beginning next year. After months of debate and political snags, the council approved rules to usher in commercial sales and cultivation set to begin in less than a month under an initiative approved by state voters. \n \n California is among 29 states where pot is legal, either for medical or recreational use. Medical marijuana has been legal in the state for two decades. \n \n With the new year just weeks away -- and the holidays coming -- industry experts say it's not clear how many businesses, if any, will be ready to open their doors on Jan. 1 to hordes of anxious customers. \n \n Under the Los Angeles regulations, residential neighborhoods would be largely off-limits to pot businesses, and buffer zones would be set up around schools, libraries and parks. ||||| PACIFIC PALISADES (CBSLA) \u2014 Stephanie Smith, who describes herself as a real estate developer educated at Boston College and UCLA, made news in December, when police accused her of running a multimillion-dollar marijuana grow operation in San Bernardino. \n \n The blonde and blue-eyed 43-year old mother of five with a huge smile made headlines around the world after San Bernardino police raided three buildings she owned and confiscated thousands of marijuana plants all seen on video. Investigators got suspicious when a $67,000 electric bill popped up at one of her properties thought to be vacant and red-tagged it. \n \n Smith lives 80 miles from San Bernardino in Pacific Palisades, where police showed up on her doorstep. \n \n Smith posted security camera photos online from that day and wrote, \u201cRaiding a woman and toddlers with SWAT in full gear and guns is absurd.\u201d \n \n Smith declined an interview but through a statement from her attorney she says she\u2019s \u201ca well-known and recognized leader in large-scale cannabis real estate development.\u201d \n \n She insists she just owns the buildings saying: \u201cThe tenants in my buildings were compliant with the laws of the State of California and had applied for licenses from the City of San Bernardino multiple times. only to have their applications rejected for technical reasons. \n \n \u201cThese raids certainly inconvenienced me, but they devastated my tenants, who are small-business operators, destroyed over 100 local jobs that paid excellent wages, squandered badly needed local tax revenue.\u201d \n \n San Bernardino Community Development Director Mark Persico is in charge of permitting marijuana businesses and says the city is an attractive spot for marijuana businesses. They already have 50 applications in the works because of Measure O, which passed in 2016. \n \n \u201cThe measure sets up a permitting process for both the cultivation of marijuana as well as the sales, testing, distribution. \u2026 It sets up a whole permit structure,\u201d said Persico, \n \n Police say the operators of the business did not have the proper permits to run a business of this scale. The plants will be destroyed, and the operators could be charged with misdemeanors. \n \n If Smith looks or sounds familiar, she was the subject of a story CBS2 ran in 2008. \n \n Back then, her last name was Darcy and she was accused of performing liposuction on patients in Dr. Craig Alan Bittner\u2019s Beverly Hills office, even though she didn\u2019t have a medical degree. \n \n Three patients sued Smith and Bittner, but the cases were dismissed. \n \n You might recall Bittner also made headlines for turning fat into biodiesel for his SUV. The two now work together in real estate development. \n \n A Statement From Smith: \n \n As a professional real estate developer with several million square feet of commercial and industrial space throughout California, I provide the infrastructure for all types of industry to operate and prosper, including the cannabis industry. I am a well-known and recognized leader in large-scale cannabis real estate development and I am proud of the State of California\u2019s position on cannabis. \n \n Clearly the Mayor of San Bernardino and I feel differently about cannabis. I\u2019m strongly on the side of the majority voters in San Bernardino and elsewhere who demand the regulation and taxation of commercial cannabis. The tenants in my buildings were compliant with the laws of the State of California and I had applied for licenses from the City of San Bernardino multiple times only to have their applications rejected for technical reasons. In raiding buildings that I own, the Mayor of San Bernardino opposed the will of the voters, wasted city resources and in the process squandered well over $1 million of potential annual city taxes from the businesses of my tenants. \n \n These raids certainly inconvenienced me, but they devastated my tenants who are small business operators, destroyed over one hundred local jobs that paid excellent wages, squandered badly needed local tax revenue and violated the will of the voters of San Bernardino. \n \n As for the marijuana investigation, the feds helped San Bernardino police with their investigation but say it\u2019s up to police if they want to move forward with pressing charges. Again, Smith hasn\u2019t been arrested. ||||| The cannabis company owned by a Pacific Palisades woman whose marijuana growing operation was uprooted by San Bernardino police late last year is suing the city to overturn a new ordinance addressing commercial cannabis businesses. \n \n The suit \u2013 filed Friday by Bubba Likes Tortillas, which owns a lot of property used for cannabis businesses \u2013 says the ordinance violates Prop. 64 and other California laws. The San Bernardino City Council unanimously approved the ordinance March 7. \n \n Stephanie Smith, owner of Bubba Likes Tortillas, claims the ordinance creates a monopoly for certain cannabis license types and bans \u201cany person who has ever had anything to do with cannabis \u2026 from entering the legal market.\u201d \n \n City Attorney Gary Saenz said by phone Monday, March 26, his office had received the lawsuit earlier in the day and hadn\u2019t had time to review it and offer a comment. \n \n The ordinance \u2013 one of three passed earlier this month \u2013 says the city can award only 17 cannabis business licenses in this first year; with 19 different cannabis license types available under California law, certain businesses can hold a monopoly on the marketplace, the suit says. \n \n State law grants cities the authority to limit cannabis businesses as they choose. \n \n Additionally, Smith claims, the ordinance disqualifies any cannabis-related enterprise previously labeled as non-compliant with city law from holding a commercial license. And a renewal could be denied if a business owner is found to have operated in violation of city or state law. \n \n Cities such as Los Angeles and Oakland are going the opposite direction and giving priority in licensing to business owners who\u2019ve had cannabis-related convictions in the past. Such social equity programs have been created to help undo some of the historic harms from the war on drugs. \n \n San Bernardino\u2019s requirements violate due process, the suit says. They do \u201cnot require a conviction, administrative hearing, or any other process other than that the City of San Bernardino has determined that the actions occurred.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis misguided ordinance is a backdoor ban that continues the City\u2019s illogical campaign against a legal product,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \n \n Smith made headlines late last year when San Bernardino police seized nearly 25,000 marijuana plants at three Bubba Likes Tortillas locations as part of an intensive investigation. One of the locations was less than a block from the rear of the police station. \n \n Smith\u2019s home also was raided. She was not arrested, though eight men at the sites were arrested on suspicion of cultivating marijuana. Less than a week later, nearly 4.5 tons of marijuana was seized at another warehouse owned by Smith. \n \n Smith did not have a permit to grow in the city, authorities said. \n \n San Bernardino\u2019s marijuana laws have been murky for a while. \n \n Voters in 2016 passed Measure O, a ballot measure requiring the city allow marijuana dispensaries in certain areas. Three permits were awarded, including one to the Flesh Showgirls strip club on Hospitality Lane. Measure O\u2019s validity later was challenged in court, putting those permits in limbo. \n \n Smith\u2019s operations were uprooted Dec. 13 and 19. On Dec. 20, city leaders passed a temporary moratorium on certain marijuana activities not covered by Measure O. Nine days later, a San Bernardino County Superior Court judge tentatively ruled Measure O invalid for spot zoning \u2013 that is, singling out parcels of land for uses benefiting their owners at the expense of others in the surrounding area. \n \n Under Measure O\u2019s zoning restrictions, Judge David Cohn wrote, only two locations in city \u2013 one being the Flesh Club, which is not associated with Bubba Likes Tortillas \u2013 would be allowed to sell marijuana. \n \n Captain Jack\u2019s, a dispensary at the Flesh Club address, opened to the public in January with a city and a state license. \n \n On Feb. 1, the City Council extended the temporary moratorium up to 10 months and 15 days. At the end of the month, Cohn declared Measure O invalid in his final, written decision. An appeal was filed on behalf of the Flesh Club owner, and Saenz said the court ruled Monday that dispensaries operating with a Measure O permit and a state license can continue operating in the city until at least April 27. \n \n The court at that time is expected to make a determination on the city\u2019s new commercial cannabis ordinance, Saenz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in the cannabis world as far as San Bernardino is concerned right now.\u201d",

Stephanie Smith, the owner of a business called Bubba Likes Tortillas, said in the lawsuit filed Friday in San Bernardino County Superior Court that the city's new law could create monopolies and also prevent her from renting property to pot growers and other marijuana operations. The dispute dates back to December when a fortified building Smith owns was raided, cultivation operations her clients were operating were shut down, and 35,000 marijuana plants were seized. Smith was not involved with pot growing and she was not arrested or charged, her attorney Ben Eilenberg said.

The new rules said anyone\u2014from a permit applicant or an employee of a cannabis business to the owners of a property\u2014could be barred from the commercial cannabis business in the city if they had violated local or state laws related to the industry or if they'd failed to report income from it.

According to Weatherford, those preliminary maps will not change- at the most, any additional changes would be minimal, and those changes would not make any appreciable difference from the preliminary maps. In addition, Weatherford stated that a deal was struck between him, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, and Senator Don Gaetz to finalize these maps and push them through as soon as possible. \n \n Weatherford tried to hide behind a need to comply with [state and] federal law, but that\u2019s obviously a dodge since there could have been many ways to comply yet not sacrifice West: \n \n A website, SaveAllenWest, had been set up, but it appears to be too late. \n \n One of the rising stars of the Tea Party is about to be sacrificed by the Republican establishment in Florida, led by someone spinning for Mitt Romney. \n \n Don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned. \n \n Update 1-30-2012: Florida redistricting looking even worse and Dem SuperPAC targeting \u201cTea Party 10\u2033. \n \n Also, Will Weatherford: The Florida legislature has NOT targeted Allen West \n \n Update No. 2 1-30-2012: Mark Levin interviewed West on January 30.

    "document": "COLUMBIA, S.C. - The South Carolina Sheriff's deputy captured on video forcefully removing a student from class has been fired, the local sheriff said Wednesday, less than a week after the incident at Spring Valley High School first came to the public's attention. \n \n Richland County Senior Deputy Ben Fields was already suspended after videos of him flipping and tossing a black female student across a classroom went viral online. \n \n Fields was told of his firing late Wednesday morning \n \n \"What he should not have done is throw the student,\" Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said. \"Police officers make mistakes too. They're human and they need to be held accountable, and that's what we've done with Deputy Ben Fields.\" \n \n Lott said he wouldn't describe Fields as remorseful, but rather sorry it all happened. \n \n Fields' lawyer released a statement on Wednesday on his behalf. In the statement it said Fields would like to acknowledge and personally thank everyone who has offered their support and positive response. \n \n \"We believe that Mr. Fields' actions were justified and lawful throughout the circumstances of which he was confronted during this incident,\" the statement read. \"To that extent, we believe that Mr. Fields' actions were carried out professionally and that he was performing his job duties within the legal threshold.\" \n \n Civil rights groups praised the swift action against Fields, a veteran school resource officer and football coach at Spring Valley High School. Outrage spread quickly after videos of the white officer arresting the black teenager on Monday appeared on the Internet. \n \n Lott thanked the FBI for investigating whether civil rights were violated, and school officials for promising to review how police are used for discipline. \n \n \"They need to understand that when they call us, we're going to take a law enforcement action,\" Lott said. \"Maybe that ought to have been something handled by the school without ever calling the deputy.\" \n \n Richland County Sheriff's Department Officer Senior Deputy Ben Fields is pictured with Karen Beaman (R), Principal of Lonnie B. Nelson Elementary School after receiving Culture of Excellence Award at Lonnie B. Nelson Elementary School in Columbia, South Carolina on November 12, 2014. REUTERS/Richland County \n \n Critics have accused Fields, who is white, of racial bias, something local officials have so far denied, and they say school teachers and administrators and even at least one fellow student have publicly said they support Fields' actions. He had been a school resource officer at Spring Valley High School for seven years, and many there have voiced support for him, Lott said. \n \n Lott has already asked the FBI to assist in the investigation into the incident, and the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights probe into it. \n \n While Lott said, \"the student was being disruptive,\" his department's review of the incident led to the conclusion that Field's \"use of force was unacceptable\" and he \"did not follow proper training, proper procedure\" when he \"threw her across the classroom.\" \n \n Because he did not follow proper procedure, Lott said Field's employment was terminated Wednesday morning. \n \n \"Deputy Ben fields did wrong,\" Lott said. \"We're taking responsibility for that. Police officers make mistakes too. They're human.\" \n \n The attorney for the teen says his client did suffer several injuries during her arrest. \n \n Columbia attorney Todd Rutherford said Wednesday that Fields should have been fired as soon as Lott saw the video recorded by several students at Spring Valley High School in Columbia. \n \n \"She now has a cast on her arm, she has neck and back injuries. She has a Band-Aid on her forehead where she suffered rug burn on her forehead,\" Rutherford said. \n \n Classmates of the student say the confrontation began when a teacher and school administrator repeatedly asked her to put away her cellphone during class. \n \n One student -- who asked that his identity be concealed -- says other kids in the class tried to defuse the situation. \n \n \"She was even told by the students to just get up and leave when the administrator came in,\" the student said. \n \n Fields was then then called to remove the student. \n \n \"You're going to come with me or I'm gonna make you,\" Fields tells the student in the video. \"Put you hands behind your back. Give me your hands, give me your hands.\" \n \n When she didn't get up from her desk, the officer wrapped a forearm around her neck, flipped her and the desk backward onto the floor, tossed her toward the front of the classroom and handcuffed her. \n \n The deputy also arrested a second girl who verbally objected to his actions. Both girls were charged with disturbing schools and released to their parents. \n \n The second student, Niya Kenny, told CBS affiliate WLTX-TV that she felt she had to say something. Doris Kenny said she's proud her daughter was \"brave enough to speak out against what was going on.\" \n \n Lott said the charges against the two students would not be dropped and would be dealt with at a later date. However, he commended the students who recorded the incident, saying he encouraged citizens to record authorities and bring it to his attention if they think something is wrong. \n \n Fields, who also helped coach the Spring Valley football team, has prevailed against accusations of excessive force and racial bias before. Lott said he would not release Fields' personnel file, saying only that some complaints have been filed in the past against him, none of which came from the school district. \n \n Trial is set for January in the case of an expelled student who claims Fields targeted blacks and falsely accused him of being a gang member in 2013. In another case, a federal jury sided with Fields after a black couple accused him of excessive force and battery during a noise complaint arrest in 2005. A third lawsuit, dismissed in 2009, involved a woman who accused him of battery and violating her rights during a 2006 arrest. \n \n Lott said there have been school resource officers in the county ever since he has been sheriff for the last 19 years. He said the deputies have to receive more training and certification. \n \n Many districts across the country put officers in schools after teenagers massacred fellow students at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999.

    "document": "J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press \n \n Even as profit surged, the board of JPMorgan Chase cut the pay package of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, by 50 percent, in light of a multibillion-dollar trading loss last year. \n \n By the overall numbers, it was a good year for JPMorgan. The bank reported a record profit of $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53 percent from the period a year earlier. Revenue was also strong, rising 10 percent, to $23.7 billion for the period. \n \n \u201cThe firm\u2019s results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth,\u201d Mr. Dimon said in statement. \n \n But the year was clouded by a multibillion-dollar trading loss stemming from a bad bet on derivatives. JPMorgan continues to unwind the bungled trade, which had racked up $6.2 billion in losses through the third quarter of 2012. The bank said it \u201cexperienced a modest loss\u201d in the last three months of the year. \n \n In light of the trading losses, the bank\u2019s board voted to reduce Mr. Dimon\u2019s total compensation. That decision was driven by a desire to hold him accountable for some of the oversight failings that led to the troubled bet, according to several people close to the board. \n \n The board cut Mr. Dimon\u2019s total compensation for 2012 to $11.5 million from $23 million a year earlier. While his salary remained the same at $1.5 million, his bonus was reduced to $10 million, paid out in restricted stock. \n \n On an earnings call on Wednesday, Mr. Dimon emphasized that this latest quarter largely signaled the end of the trading debacle. \u201cWe are getting near the end of it,\u201d he said. Mr. Dimon acknowledged that the board \u201chad a tough job\u201d in assessing how to reduce his total compensation for the year. While \u201cthis was one huge mistake,\u201d Mr. Dimon said, the board had to look at \u201cthe positives and the negatives.\u201d He added that he \u201crespects their decision.\u201d \n \n Although Mr. Dimon\u2019s compensation fell sharply, he dodged much of the criticism for the trading losses in two reports released on Wednesday. One report details the result of a sweeping investigation into the trades led by Michael J. Cavanagh, formerly the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, and the other outlines the board\u2019s findings. \n \n In the case of Mr. Dimon, the reports mainly took aim at his over-reliance on senior managers. \u201cHe could have better tested his reliance on what he was told,\u201d the investigation found. \n \n Instead, much of the blame centered on Ina R. Drew, who oversaw the chief investment unit where the trading took place. Ms. Drew resigned in May shortly after the losses were disclosed. \n \n Under Ms. Drew\u2019s leadership, there were failures \u201cin three critical areas,\u201d including the execution of a complex trading strategy and gaps in oversight of the large portfolio, according to the investigation. The report indicated that Ms. Drew failed \u201cto appreciate the magnitude and significance of the changes\u201d as the riskiness of the trades escalated. \n \n Barry Zubrow, the bank\u2019s former chief risk officer, was also singled out. Douglas Braunstein, who left his position as chief financial officer in November, was cited \u201cfor weaknesses in financial controls.\u201d The investigation found that the organization should \u201chave asked more questions or to have sought additional information about the evolution of the portfolio.\u201d \n \n Despite the overhang of the bad bet, JPMorgan produced record profit for the quarter, as economic and credit conditions improved. The bank reduced the money it set aside for potential losses, adding to overall profit. And the bank recorded gains in all its major divisions, showing strength in both consumer and corporate banking operations. \n \n For the full year, JPMorgan reported earnings of $21.3 billion, compared with $19 billion in 2011. Revenue in 2012, at $97 billion, was essentially flat. \n \n Despite the rocky market conditions and uncertainty related to the budget impasse, the corporate-focused businesses reported nice gains. Investment banking fees jumped 54 percent, to $1.7 billion, with improvements in debt and equity underwriting. Revenue in the commercial banking group hit $1.75 billion, after the 10th consecutive quarter of loan growth. \n \n Income in JPMorgan\u2019s asset management group rose 60 percent, to $483 million. JPMorgan has been ramping up the business, as riskier ventures get crimped by new regulation. \n \n Like other big banks, JPMorgan\u2019s earnings have been bolstered by a surge in mortgage lending, driven in part by a series of federal programs that have helped drive down interest rates. As homeowners seize on the low rates, JPMorgan is experiencing a flurry of refinancing applications. The bank is also making bigger gains when those loans are packaged and eventually sold to big investors. \n \n Over all, the mortgage banking group posted profit of $418 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $269 million in the period a year earlier. \n \n But those low interest rates also present a challenge for JPMorgan, which is dealing with glut of deposits. The bank reported average total deposits of $404 billion, up 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011. \n \n As deposits pile up, the situation is weighing on profitability. The margin on deposits continued to shrink, dropping to 2.44 percent from 2.76 percent the period a year earlier. \n \n The bank also continues to face a slew of legal problems. \n \n In the last year, JPMorgan has worked to move beyond some of the issues stemming from the mortgage crisis. Along with competitors, JPMorgan reached deals with federal regulators over claims that its foreclosures practices might have led to wrongful eviction of homeowners. JPMorgan and other banks agreed this month to a $8.5 billion settlement with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, which ends a costly and flawed review of loans in foreclosure ordered up by the regulators in 2011. The bank spent roughly $700 million this quarter on costs associated with the review. \n \n Still, the bank is dealing with other cases that could prove costly. New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, filed a lawsuit against the bank related to Bear Stearns, the troubled unit that JPMorgan bought in the depths of the financial crisis. In the suit, filed in October, the attorney general claimed JPMorgan had defrauded investors who bought securities created from shoddy mortgages. \n \n JPMorgan was also hit with two enforcement actions this week, the first formal sanctions from federal banking regulators over the bank\u2019s multibillion-dollar trading loss. Regulators from the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency identified flaws throughout the bank, citing failures in its ability to assess how big losses might swell as a result of the complex trades. In addition, regulators found that bank executives did not adequately inform board members about the potential losses. ||||| JPMorgan Chase slashed CEO Jamie Dimon's bonus by 53%, citing the fallout from the bank's so-called London Whale trading losses. \n \n Dimon will take home $11.5 million, including a $10 million bonus. Last year, he was the best paid bank CEO with a $23.1 million pay package that included a $21.5 million bonus. \n \n JPMorgan's board also decided to push back Dimon's eligibility to sell $79 million of JPMorgan's stock for 18 months. Roughly 2 million shares were eligible for vesting on Jan. 22. \n \n \"As Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility for such failures,\" the board said in regulatory filing. \n \n At the same time, the board also noted that JPMorgan has reported record profits for three consecutive years and praised what they called Dimon's forceful response to the trading problems. \n \n Related: Why is JPMorgan's board unchanged? \n \n JPMorgan reported fourth-quarter net income of $5.7 billion, or $1.39 a share, beating forecasts, while revenue of $24.4 billion was in line with estimates. \n \n The bank's strong results were driven by a sharp uptick in new mortgages, with mortgage originations increasing 33% year-over year. Fees from mortgages jumped 181% from the prior year. \n \n While the housing recovery is underway, Dimon said on an analyst call that he expects mortgage revenue to bounce around over the next several quarters. \n \n Revenues in all of the bank's business line, including investment banking and consumer banking, increased from last year. Investment banking fees jumped 52% in the fourth quarter. \n \n JPMorgan reduced its staff by 1,500, or roughly 0.5%, to end the year with 258,965 employees. Even with the cuts, compensation expenses jumped 12% from the prior year. \n \n For the full year, the bank earned $21.3 billion, or $5.20 a share, on revenue of $99.9 billion \n \n Related: Hey Wall Street, get ready for more layoffs \n \n Still, investors weren't thrilled by the bank's results. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) straddled the breakeven line Wednesday. So far this year, the bank's stock has gained more than 5%, after rallying 35% in 2012. \n \n Going forward, Dimon said JPMorgan expects to buy back less stock in the coming quarters to shore up its capital reserves. The bank still plans to buy back up to $3 billion of stock during the current quarter, but will ask regulators for permission to repurchase fewer shares after that. \n \n Since the financial crisis, the largest banks have been required to prove to the Federal Reserve that they have sufficient capital reserves to withstand another financial crisis. DImon said that the bank will spend this year building up its reserve related to international regulatory guidelines known as Basel III. \n \n JPMorgan managed to generate profits during each quarter of 2012, despite recording a $6.2 billion loss from the so-called London Whale trade -- the massive bet on credit derivatives made by one of the bank's London units that went terribly wrong. \n \n Since the trading losses were revealed, JPMorgan has shaken up its executive ranks and appointed a new chief financial officer. The bank has also fired executives and traders responsible for the losses and has said that their pay is subject to clawbacks. \n \n In October, the bank filed suit against Javier Martin-Artajo, the former boss of Bruno Iksil, the trader who made the bad bets and came to be known as the \"London Whale.\" A source familiar with the case said Wednesday that the suit had been settled, with Martin-Artajo agreeing to return some of his pay via the clawback mechanism in his contract. \n \n Martin-Artajo could not be reached for comment. The news was reported earlier by Reuters. \n \n The fallout from the London Whale continued this week, when the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ordered JPMorgan to improve its risk management procedures. \n \n In November, the bank said other agencies -- including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission -- were also investigating the matter. \n \n On a call with journalists early Wednesday, Dimon said he expects it to be \"non-issue\" very soon. \"We're getting near the end of it,\" he said. \n \n JPMorgan is the second major bank to report earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC) kicked off bank earnings season last Friday and Goldman Sachs (GS) reported fourth-quuarter profits that topped expectations early Wednesday. \n \n Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) will release results Thursday morning, and Morgan Stanley (MS) reports early Friday. \n \n CNNMoney's James O'Toole contributed to this report. ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Both have agreed to return some of their pay, a source tells CNNMoney. \u2013 It's a big day for Wall Street bankers: Morgan Stanley employees are getting IOUs instead of cash bonuses for the first time since the financial crisis, reports the Wall Street Journal. The bonuses will be paid in four equal installments, with the first coming in May and the last in January 2016. The Journal calls it a \"fundamental change\" in how bonuses have been paid since the crisis. Before the crisis, most banks paid out cash bonuses every year.",

Signs of starvation were obvious, with the oldest adult child weighing just 82 pounds, they said. \n \n The children were locked up as punishment, beaten and denied food and things normal kids enjoy, like toys and games, authorities said. They were allowed to do little except write in journals that may corroborate the horrific stories they told investigators. \n \n The girl planned her escape for two years and was terrified as she climbed out a window and ran to freedom, Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Manuel Campos testified. \n \n \"She couldn't even dial 911 because she was so scared that she was shaking,\" he said. \n \n When she called the dispatcher around the corner from her house, the girl wasn't even sure what street she was on. The kids were rarely allowed to go outside, though they did trick-or-treat on Halloween and traveled as a family to Disneyland and Las Vegas. \n \n \"I don't go out much so I don't know anything about the streets or anything,\" she said on the call and confirmed she was reading her address off a piece of paper with her mother's name on it. \n \n The girl said she hadn't bathed in about a year and that the house was filthy. \n \n \"Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because of how dirty the house is,\" she said, adding she washed her hair and face in the sink. \n \n Dirt was caked on the girl's skin and she smelled unbathed, said Campos, who interviewed the girl later in the day. \n \n The girl, who said she hadn't finished first grade, had difficulty pronouncing some words and spoke like a child much younger than her age, Campos said.

She didn't like it and pushed away and pulled up her pants as she heard her mother coming upstairs. \n \n \"Her father told her she better not tell anybody what happened,\" Campos said. \n \n The family moved several times, including a stint in Texas, where the girl said they were left on their own for about four years, though her mother bought them food. \n \n The children mostly were locked in their rooms and were only allowed to leave to eat, use the bathroom and brush their teeth. \n \n There was no breakfast, and recently lunch and dinner had been combined into one meal that included peanut butter or bologna sandwiches, a frozen burrito and chips, she said.

She suffered nerve damage in her arms and hands, and doctors are keeping an eye on her kidney and liver, but she seems to have escaped major harm. \"I feel very lucky,\" she tells the TV station. \"Lucky to be sitting here doing this interview today.\" She's even making light of herself on Instagram, telling people to call her Sparky. It turns out that Martinez's father also got zapped, though his telltale rash didn't show up until after the family had returned from the hospital. \"My right arm gets tingly,\" he says. The family home sustained significant damage from the strike, which a neighbor says appeared to have come from beneath the house and exited through the roof.

He later added, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to glorify him, but I can tell you this: He had the admiration of a lot of inmates, but he was also feared.\u201d \n \n Mills was known for committing brazen, brutal killings \u2014 including a savage attempted decapitation while in federal custody in Atlanta. When authorities placed him in solitary confinement, his bloody legacy continued. Using couriers, he distributed orders from coast to coast, leading to a race war between prison gangs and a notorious protection deal with Italian mobster John Gotti. \n \n \u201cThere are a lot of rumors out there about Barry and his cohorts, some real, some imaginary,\u201d said Dean Steward, Mills\u2019 longtime attorney. \u201cI saw a different side to him than that jury saw in \u201906.\u201d \n \n Bay Area Connections \n \n When Mills joined the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood \u2014 also known as The Brand \u2014 in San Quentin during the mid-1970s, it was a \u201cdinky, little prison gang,\u201d said Hood, a former warden of the ADX supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. Mills built it into a nationwide army and first caught authorities\u2019 attention by planning and ordering a Central Valley bank robbery from his cell. \n \n \u201cDifferent states produce different types of inmates,\u201d said Terry Rearick, a defense investigator who worked on Mills\u2019 case. \u201cCalifornia is a state that produces some of the most dangerous and clever inmates \u2026 these guys were more or less products of the prison system here.\u201d \n \n Considered one of the biggest public safety threats in the early 2000s, he was revered among Aryan gang members. \n \n \u201c(Mills) was the gold standard for gangsterism all over the USA,\u201d said Coby Phillips, who with Mills\u2019 permission co-founded an Aryan Brotherhood offshoot gang called the Family Affiliated Irish Mafia in Contra Costa County. \u201cHis word was the law \u2026 whether he was crocheting blankets for the kids or chopping someone\u2019s head off, there wasn\u2019t nobody better.\u201d \n \n In 1999, Mills pondered ordering a Contra Costa County resident \u2014 Ronnie Yandell, described by prosecutors as one of Mills\u2019 generals \u2014 to retaliate against a black prison gang for an assault on Gotti. Mills changed his mind when he realized Yandell was scheduled for release from federal prison. \n \n \u201cMills wanted Yandell to work for the AB on the outside,\u201d prosecutor Bruce Flynn said. \n \n So Yandell returned to Contra Costa County, where in 2001 he was arrested and charged with murdering William Bedwell, 38, and Dino Gutierrez, 38, in El Sobrante. He was ultimately convicted of murder and manslaughter, but wrote \u201cI am innocent\u201d in a failed 2007 appeal motion filed from prison. \n \n While awaiting trial, Yandell allegedly ordered Aryan Brotherhood members Coby Phillips and Darryl Grockett to kill the witnesses. They failed, and some say Phillips flat-out refused. \n \n \u201cWhat I had heard was Coby or Grockett were then told to kill one another,\u201d said Tom Kensok, a former Contra Costa senior deputy district attorney. \n \n In 2004, Grockett was shot to death along an unincorporated country road. Phillips and another man, Jose Vega-Robles, were convicted and sentenced to life. \n \n Federal crackdown and conviction \n \n In the early 2000s, the federal government moved in on the Aryan Brotherhood. Mills became the lead defendant in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, indictment that sought to take down the gang. Forty members and co-conspirators were charged in 14 killings and dozens of attempted hits. \n \n According to prosecutors, Mills and his second in command, Tyler Bingham, were preparing for a war with a gang called the DC Blacks. Prosecutors say they used multiple ways to carry out the message, including invisible ink created from urine and written onto an innocent-seeming correspondence. \n \n Mills\u2019 couriers included a Rodeo woman who was married to a Sonoma Hells Angels chapter club president at the time and spent months on the lam before she was caught. \n \n In 2006, Mills, Bingham and two others went on trial together, facing racketeering and murder charges. They were convicted largely based upon the word of an Aryan Brotherhood dropout, who admitted to carrying out a killing but took a plea deal for fewer than 10 years in prison. \n \n Mills faced the death penalty, which required a unanimous jury vote. When jurors voted 9-3 in favor of executing him, he was spared. He spent the rest of his life locked down at the supermax facility in Colorado, confined to his cell 23 hours a day. \n \n \u201cBarry would not let us put on a penalty phase case,\u201d his attorney Steward said. \u201cHis whole thing was, \u2018No sniveling.'\u201d ||||| FLORENCE, Colo.

    "document": "U.S. President Barack Obama attends the East Asia Summit at the Peace Palace in Phnom Penh, Cambodia Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2012. Obama is in Cambodia on the final leg of his three-country tour of Southeast... (Associated Press) \n \n President Barack Obama's attendance at an annual summit of Southeast Asian leaders on Tuesday thrust him right in the eye of the region's most stormy dispute: the long-raging rivalry between China and five neighbors for control of strategic and resource-rich waters in the South China Sea. \n \n The inability to resolve these territorial conflicts has become a major impediment to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations as it tackles ambitious dreams like a plan to turn the economically vibrant region of 600 million people into an EU-like community by the end of 2015. \n \n Neither the U.S. nor China is a member of ASEAN, but each has strong supporters in the group. Summit host Cambodia, an ally of China, has tried at this week's summit to shift the focus to economic concerns, but Beijing's territorial disputes with its ASEAN neighbors _ including staunch U.S. ally the Philippines _ have yet again overshadowed discussions. \n \n The disagreement sparked a tense moment Monday when Philippine President Benigno Aquino III challenged Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had tried to cut off a discussion of the territorial disputes. \n \n Into this heated atmosphere came Obama, who flew to Phnom Penh for Tuesday's expanded East Asia Summit, in which the 10 ASEAN countries were joined by eight other nations, including China and the United States. Behind closed doors, the Chinese and Philippine leaders pressed their territorial claims while others called for restraint. After the summit, the exchange shifted to the chandelier-lit lobby, where diplomats of the two countries reiterated their positions. \n \n Senior Chinese diplomat Fu Ying expressed dismay that the disputes again got the spotlight. \"We do not want to bring the disputes to an occasion like this and we do not want to give over-emphasis to the territorial disputes and differences,\" she said. \n \n Washington has reiterated that it takes no sides in the territorial disputes but would not allow any country to resort to force and block access to the South China Sea, a vital commercial and military gateway to Asia's heartland. \n \n Washington has also called for the early crafting of a \"code of conduct\" to prevent clashes in the disputed territories, a call backed by Australia and Japan, but it remains unclear if and when China will sit down with rival claimants to draft such a legally binding nonaggression pact. \n \n The potentially oil- and gas-rich South China Sea islands and waters are contested by China, Taiwan and four ASEAN members _ Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. \n \n The last fighting, involving China and Vietnam, killed more than 70 Vietnamese sailors in 1988, and fears that the conflicts could spark Asia's next war have kept governments on edge. \n \n Vietnam and the Philippines, backed by Washington, have been loudest on the issue, and want China to negotiate with the other claimants as a group. China wants one-on-one negotiations _ which would give it an advantage because of its sheer size and economic clout _ and has warned Washington to stay away from an issue it says should not be \"internationalized,\" a position echoed by Cambodia at the Phnom Penh summit. \n \n There have been several recent standoffs involving boats and other shows of force, particularly between China and the Philippines, which both claim ownership of the Spratly Islands, a spray of tiny South China Sea atolls. \n \n Their latest diplomatic confrontation occurred a few hours before Obama touched down Monday in the Cambodian capital, when Hun Sen announced as he was closing a meeting that all ASEAN leaders had agreed not to discuss the divisive issue in talks between the 10-nation bloc and China. \n \n Alarmed, Aquino raised his hand, stood up and objected to Hun Sen's statement, saying his country, which plans to bring the disputes before a U.N. tribunal, was not party to any such agreement. It was a blunt gesture in the usually servile ambiance of the conservative bloc, an unwieldy collective of rigid, authoritarian regimes and nascent democracies. \n \n After a brief lull, Hun Sen recovered and said Aquino's remarks would be reflected in the record of the meeting. Still, Cambodian and Chinese officials insisted that the agreement stood. Tensions intensified Tuesday when the Philippines was joined by Vietnam and Singapore in objecting to a plan by Cambodia to state in a post-summit statement by the host country that there was indeed such an agreement, Philippine diplomats said. \n \n An objection from the Philippines, or any ASEAN nation, ought to be enough to thrash any agreement because the bloc decides by consensus, meaning just one veto from any member kills any proposal. \n \n \"The bottom line is they can talk all they want but if we said we're not with it, there's no consensus, finished,\" Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario told reporters. \n \n The dispute, and Obama's presence here, highlights how ASEAN has become a major battleground for influence in Asia, just like the South China Sea. The U.S. is pushing its \"Pacific pivot\" to the region following years of engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan. China, the Asian superpower, has acted to protect its home ground. \n \n Southeast Asia is clearly pinned in between, and the lack of consensus among the group over the maritime disputes has pushed much of the bloc's other work to the sidelines. \n \n In July, after a foreign ministers' meeting also hosted by Cambodia, the group failed to publicly issue a traditional after-conference communique _ an embarrassing failure that was a first in ASEAN's 45-year history. Vietnam and the Philippines had insisted that the joint statement simply state that the South China Sea rifts were discussed, but Cambodia adamantly refused, echoing China's line to keep a lid on public discussions of the disputes. \n \n Ernest Bower of the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington, D.C., said the imbroglio in July showed that as long as any ASEAN country remains weak and vulnerable to muscling from a major power, the entire group could be compromised. \n \n \"ASEAN learned a hard lesson from the event,\" Bower said, \"namely, that they should never again allow a fellow ASEAN member country to feel so isolated, exposed or dependent on any foreign power that the country feels compelled to step beyond ASEAN protocols ... in a way that damages the organization's interests and profile.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Grant Peck and Sopheng Cheang contributed to this report. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Obama (centre) was part of talks between Asian nations that saw discussion of maritime rows and trade pacts \n \n US President Barack Obama has urged Asian nations to ease tensions over maritime disputes, amid terse exchanges at the end of a summit in Cambodia. \n \n China and the Philippines openly clashed over who owns islands in the South China Sea, as the East Asia summit came to a close in Phnomh Penh. \n \n Mr Obama warned against allowing such disputes to escalate. \n \n Japanese and Australian leaders also attended the meeting, which was part of regional Asean talks. \n \n The BBC's Jonah Fisher, in Phnomh Penh, says it was an acrimonious end to a summit in which South East Asian countries failed to reach consensus among themselves over how to resolve the various territorial disputes with China. \n \n Mr Obama's arrival on Monday at the regional talks between the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) and other partner countries came amid fractious debate on the maritime row between China and its Asian neighbours. \n \n The Scarborough Shoal, or Huangyan islands as they are called in China, were at the centre of a stand-off between China and the Philippines earlier this year. \n \n On Tuesday the US president met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao but did not refer to the row in public comments. \n \n The \"co-operative and constructive approach\" the US and China had taken to ties served both countries, Mr Obama said, but \"clear rules of the road\" were needed for international trade. \n \n Mr Wen, for his part, said economic co-operation would be enhanced \"as a means to tackle the difficulties we have and resolve the difference and disagreements between us\". \n \n Asia is one part of the world that still has economic growth, and the American recovery depends on that continuing. The president is trying to establish various free-trade agreements with countries in the region. Asia is also the arena for a struggle between the world's only two super-powers - ideology and power are at stake. \n \n Both sides ignored shouted questions from reporters about the South China Sea, AFP news agency said. \n \n \"President Obama's message is there needs to be a reduction of the tensions,\" deputy National Security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said after the summit. \n \n \"There is no reason to risk any potential escalation, particularly when you have two of the world's largest economies - China and Japan - associated with some of those disputes.\" \n \n China claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea, including areas also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. \n \n Tensions have been high with Manila and Hanoi in recent months amid stand-offs and minor clashes around shoals and islands disputed with China. \n \n The last Asean summit in July broke up acrimoniously, without a joint communique, with China facing accusations of using its clout to force host Cambodia to keep the territorial issue off the agenda. \n \n Tensions continued at the latest summit. Cambodia said on Sunday that Asean nations had agreed not to \"internationalise\" the issue, something Beijing has been pushing for. \n \n But on Monday, the Philippines - which has been boosting ties with the US - said no such accord had been reached and that it had \"the inherent right to defend its national interests when deemed necessary\". \n \n The Philippines lodged a formal protest against Cambodia, saying that it was trying to contain discussions on the matter. \n \n China said it did not want to bring the disputes to such a forum. \"We do not want to give over emphasis to the territorial disputes and differences, and we don't think it's a good idea to spread a sense of tension in this region,\" Wen Jiabao told the summit, according to Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Ying. \n \n Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda also raised security concerns in a meeting with Mr Obama. Japan is currently embroiled in a separate territorial dispute with Beijing over islands in the East China Sea. \n \n \"With the increasing severity of the security environment in East Asia, the importance of the Japan-US alliance is increasing,\" Mr Noda said. \n \n Trade moves \n \n Discussions at the summit also focused on at least three free trade pacts in the region. \n \n Officials from China, Japan and South Korea met on the sidelines to start talks on the possibility of a free-trade zone, the three countries said in a joint statement. \n \n Asean countries and China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand have also launched negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade pact, which seeks to strengthen regional trade. \n \n The US also led the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations which currently involve four countries from Asean - Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. \n \n Mr Obama arrived in Cambodia from Burma, where he spent six hours meeting top leaders. \n \n The first visit to the country by a serving US president, it was seen as a response to reforms initiated by the government of President Thein Sein.",

    "concatenated_intermediate": "\u2013 President Obama arrived in Cambodia today for the East Asia Summit, a gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the AP reports that his presence has thrust him right in the eye of the region's most stormy dispute: the long-raging rivalry between China and five neighbors for control of strategic and resource-rich waters in the South China Sea. Behind closed doors, the Chinese and Philippine leaders pressed their territorial claims while others called for restraint. After the summit, the exchange shifted to the chandelier-lit lobby, where diplomats of the two countries reiterated their positions. Senior Chinese diplomat Fu Ying expressed dismay that the disputes again got the spotlight. \"We do not want to bring the disputes to an occasion like this and we do not need to give over-emphasis to the territorial disputes and differences,\" she said. The last fighting, involving China and Vietnam, killed more than 70 Vietnamese sailors in 1988, and fears that the conflicts could spark Asia's next war have kept governments on edge. Vietnam and the Philippines, backed by Washington, have been loudest on the issue, and want China to negotiate with the other claimants as a group. China wants one-on-one negotiations\u2014which would give it an advantage because of its sheer size and economic clout\u2014and has \u2013 President Obama arrived in Cambodia today for a two-day visit, during which he'll meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen and other leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the AP reports. Obama is expected to raise concerns about China's increasingly aggressive moves in the South China Sea, particularly with the ASEAN nations. The region is \"one of the fastest-growing regions in the world,\" the White House said in a statement. \"The United States is committed to promoting a rules-based international order that is conducive to peace and stability in the region and the wider Asia-Pacific region.\" But as the AP notes, tensions between China and ASEAN nations are on the rise. Just hours before Obama's arrival in Cambodia, Hun Sen announced that all ASEAN leaders had agreed not to discuss the territorial disputes between the nations in talks with China. Philippines President Benigno Aquino raised his hand and stood up when he heard the statement, saying his country wasn't part of any such agreement. But Hun Sen quickly recovered and said Aquino's remarks would be reflected in the record of the meeting. Still, Cambodian and Chinese officials insisted that the agreement stood. \u2013 President Obama has wrapped up a two-day summit in Cambodia with a plea for calm in the region over territorial disputes with China. At the end of the East Asia summit, the Philippines lodged a formal protest against Cambodia, saying it was trying to contain discussions on the matter, the BBC reports. China and the Philippines openly clashed over who owns islands in the South China Sea. \"We do not want to give over emphasis to the territorial disputes and differences, and we don't think it's a good idea to spread a sense of tension in this region,\" China's deputy foreign minister told the summit, according to the AP. The last Asean summit in July broke up acrimoniously without a joint communique, with China facing accusations of using its clout to force host Cambodia to keep the territorial issue off the agenda. Cambodia said on Sunday that Asean nations had agreed not to \"internationalize\" the issue, something Beijing has been pushing for. But on Monday the Philippines\u2014which has been boosting ties with the US\u2014said no such accord had been reached and that it had \"the inherent right to defend its national interests when deemed necessary.\" \u2013 President Obama arrived in Cambodia today for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit, where he'll have a chance to press regional leaders on issues including Burma's democratic reforms and territorial disputes with China. Cambodia and the Philippines have both denied reports that they've struck a deal to protect their interests in those disputes, the BBC reports. Philippines President Benigno Aquino says his country has \"the inherent right to defend its national interests when deemed necessary.\" China, meanwhile, says it won't bring the disputes to the Asean-China summit. \"We do not want to give over emphasis to the territorial disputes and differences, and we don't think it's a good idea to spread a sense of tension in this region,\" says a deputy foreign minister. Asean is made up of 10 countries plus Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Obama will have a working lunch today with leaders from all 10 countries, including Chinese President Wen Jiabao and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.",

The Dalai Lama argued that European countries were \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for assisting \u201ca refugee really facing danger against their life,\u201d but that refugees should ultimately go back and rebuild their home countries.

    "document": "Trump vexes allies as he calls for Russia to rejoin G-7 The statement comes as Trump was already feuding with Macron and Trudeau ahead of the world leader meeting in Canada. \n \n President Donald Trump on Friday called for Russia to be reinstated into the group of the world\u2019s largest economies, drawing the ire of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and further inflaming tensions at the G-7 meeting in Canada. \n \n \u201cNow, I love our country. I have been Russia's worst nightmare,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut with that being said, Russia should be in this meeting. Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting?\u201d \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Trump made the remarks on the White House South Lawn as he left for the G-7 summit in Quebec, which he will depart from early in order to travel to Singapore, where he is scheduled to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un next week. \n \n His suggestion that the G-7 welcome Russia back into the fold is likely to heighten tensions in Quebec, where the president is expected to meet with allies irate over his decision to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and the European Union. In recent days, Trump has engaged in a war of words with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \n \n The G-7, short for Group of Seven, was the G-8 until 2014, when the group\u2019s members expelled Russia over its invasion and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. The G-7\u2019s current membership comprises the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain. \n \n \u201cI would recommend \u2014 and it's up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it. You know, whether you like it or not, and it may not be politically correct, but we have a world to run,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd in the G-7, which used to be the G-8, they threw Russia out. They should let Russia come back in. Because we should have Russia at the negotiating table.\u201d \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). \n \n \u201cPresident Trump is turning our foreign policy into an international joke, doing lasting damage to our country, without any rhyme or reason. We need the president to be able to distinguish between our allies and adversaries, and to treat each accordingly. On issue after issue, he\u2019s failed to do that,\" Schumer said in a statement. \u201cThe president\u2019s support for inviting Russia back into the G-7, just after they meddled in the election to support his campaign, will leave millions of Americans with serious questions and suspicions.\u201d \n \n \"This is weak. Putin is not our friend and he is not the president's buddy,\" Sasse said in his own statement. \"He is a thug using Soviet-style aggression to wage a shadow war against America, and our leaders should act like it.\" \n \n Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic who tangled with the president earlier this week, was blunt in a tweet: \"No, Russia should not be added to the G-7.\" \n \n Flake's Arizona colleague, GOP Sen. John McCain, was similarly critical of the president's suggestion in a statement emailed to reporters Friday afternoon. \n \n \u201cVladimir Putin chose to make Russia unworthy of membership in the G-8 by invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea. Nothing he has done since then has changed that most obvious fact,\" McCain said. \u201cThe President has inexplicably shown our adversaries the deference and esteem that should be reserved for our closest allies.\u201d \n \n Trump\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s reentry into the group of leading economies adds to the lengthy list of warm gestures he has offered for the Kremlin and its leader, President Vladimir Putin. Critics of the president have long complained that his foreign policy is too soft on Russia, which the U.S. intelligence community has said sought to interfere in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf, especially relative to the president\u2019s get-tough approach to foreign policy elsewhere around the globe. \n \n But while Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward Russia, and Putin in particular, has been noticeably warmer than that of his predecessor, the president and his administration have pointed often to significant steps taken against the Kremlin, including new sanctions, the expulsion of dozens of diplomats and the forced closure of Russia\u2019s two West Coast consulates, in Seattle and San Francisco. \n \n \"If Hillary got in, I think Putin is probably going, \u2018Man, I wish Hillary won,\u2019 because you see what I do,\" Trump said on Friday about his harsher actions against Russia. \n \n Russia had been scheduled to host the G-8 summit in 2014 and had been planning to hold the leaders\u2019 gathering in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, which was also the site of the Winter Olympics that year. But after Russian troops invaded Crimea, officials quickly rescheduled for Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union, which participates in both the G-7 and the G-20. Russia remains a part of the larger group. \n \n Trump has run afoul of some of America's closest allies in the run-up to the Quebec gathering. \n \n He has devoted significant focus in recent weeks to resetting U.S. trade relationships around the globe, complaining especially loudly about what he says is unfair treatment by top trade partners like Canada and the EU. The president's decision to impose tariffs on both earned him a stern rebuke from Trudeau and the leaders of multiple major EU nations. \n \n Trump was originally scheduled to meet Friday for two bilateral meetings, one with Trudeau and another with Macron, although the White House said Friday morning that Trump was running late and that the Macron meeting would have to be rescheduled for later in the day. Trudeau's greeting of Trump ahead of their meeting appeared somewhat stiff but was marked mostly by handshakes and pleasantries. \n \n White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump and Macron met informally and \"exchanged pleasantries and briefly discussed trade.\" She added that Macron and Trump would hold another meeting later Friday. \n \n Macron and Trump both promised this week to confront Trump over his recent decision to impose tariffs on U.S. allies, using blunt language to describe their positions. \n \n \u201cMaybe the American president doesn\u2019t care about being isolated today, but we don\u2019t mind being six, if needs be,\u201d Macron said. \n \n Following their joint meeting at the summit, Macron said he and Trump had a \u201cvery direct discussion.\u201c But both of the leaders\u2018 description of their chat were devoid of the escalating rhetoric they had exchanged in the days and hours leading up the summit. \n \n \u201cI also want to congratulate you, because I\u2018m reading what\u2018s going on in France,\u201c Trump told Macron in front of a gathering of reporters. \u201cYou've got great courage. You\u2018re doing the right thing.\u201c \n \n Trump hit back on Twitter late Thursday. \n \n \"Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers,\" he tweeted. \"The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.\" \n \n He added, \"Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn\u2019t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy \u2014 hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!\" \n \n When asked by reporters Friday morning about the spat, Trump presented it as a temporary trade dispute and that \"in the end we'll all get along.\" \n \n \"Look, all of these countries have been taking advantage of the United States on trade,\" Trump said. \"We have massive trade deficits with almost every country. We will straighten that out. And I'll tell you what, it's what I do. It won't even be hard, and in the end we'll all get along. ... When it all straightens out, we'll all be in love again.\" \n \n The president later made light of the distance between himself and Trudeau on trade, joking during a bilateral meeting that the prime minister \u201chas agreed to cut all tariffs and all trade barriers between Canada and the United States.\u201c Trump then reassured reporters the two were \u201cactually working\u201c on the matter and had \u201cmade a lot of progress today.\u201c \n \n Trump managed to draw a laugh from Trudeau and Merkel prior to a working session on Friday afternoon. The president caught sight of New York Times photographer Doug Mills, turned to Trudeau and quipped: \"He's the number one photographer in the world. Unfortunately, he works for The New York Times.\" \n \n The remarks, overheard by a pool reporter, prompted laughter from Trudeau and Merkel. Reporters were subsequently escorted out. \n \n Despite numerous other differences, Western leaders have remained united in the need to maintain economic sanctions and other pressure on Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine \u2014 not just in Crimea but also in the eastern Donbas region, where it has supported an armed insurgency. An international investigative team recently announced that a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet, Flight MH-17, that was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014 was destroyed by a Russian missile supplied by a specific military unit in southern Russia. \n \n Putin has continued to deny any Russian role in that episode, which killed all 298 people on board. Putin initially denied that Russian military forces had invaded Crimea but later acknowledged that they had done so, and even bestowed awards on soldiers who participated in the operation. \n \n David Herszenhorn and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report. ||||| President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before leaving the White House in Washington, Friday, June 8, 2018, to attend the G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada.

The suspension was supported by the other members of the group, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and four European nations. \n \n Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russia in a bid to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:25 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump says he won't be talking about the Russia probe for a while because he'll be focused on trade talks at the annual Group of Seven meeting of industrialized nations. \n \n Trump notes on Twitter that he's heading for Canada, where the nations' leaders are gathering at a Quebec resort. Several are expected to challenge Trump's new trade policies, which include tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. \n \n Trump tweets that the talks \"will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States.\" After that, he'll head to Singapore for a summit with North Korea. \n \n He adds: \"Won't be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while!\" \n \n ___ \n \n 6:40 a.m. \n \n President Donald Trump says he is looking forward to \"straightening out unfair Trade Deals\" at the annual Group of Seven meeting. \n \n The group of industrialized nations is gathering at a Quebec resort for discussions that are expected to be tense.

They stressed the need for respectful dialogue but say they will push back against new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as they have on other issues. \n \n Trump is showing no signs of backing away from what he sees as key campaign promises. He tweeted Thursday: \"Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made).\" ||||| Quebec City (CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday that Russia should be reinstated to a leading group of industrialized nations ahead of his visit to the G7 summit this weekend. \n \n Trump's statement is an extraordinary break from key US allies, and particularly striking given Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. A special counsel investigation into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russia is underway, though Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations. \n \n \"Russia should be in this meeting,\" Trump told reporters upon leaving the White House for the summit, which is being held in Charlevoix, Canada. \"They should let Russia come back in, because we should have Russia at the negotiating table.\" \n \n Russia was suspended from the group -- then known as the G8 -- in 2014 after the majority of member countries allied against Russia's annexation of Crimea, which Russia continues to hold. \n \n Asked in an interview earlier this week about what would need to happen for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Austria's ORF broadcasting corporation that \"there are no such conditions and there can never be.\" \n \n Friction with key allies \n \n Trump's comments underscore the growing divide between the US, under his administration, and Washington's closest allies. \n \n The President's willingness to look the other way on Russia's annexation of Crimea -- the first violation of a European country's borders since World War II -- will particularly deepen the chill with allies such as the UK, France and Germany, which are already furious about US trade tariffs, and Trump's rejection of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. \n \n \"We always been clear we should engage with Russia where it is in our interests, but we need to remember why G8 became the G7: it was because Russia illegally annexed Crimea,\" a European diplomat told CNN. \"Since then, we have seen an increase in Russian misbehavior and attempts to undermine democracy in Europe. It is not appropriate for Russia to rejoin until we see it behaving responsibly. Putin should get nothing for free.\" \n \n At home, Trump's continuing failure to condemn Russia for its aggressive behavior and his ongoing push to restore more normal relations is bound to raise questions, once again, about his affinity for Moscow and Putin. \n \n Sen. John McCain blasted Trump for his comments, saying \"The President has inexplicably shown our adversaries the deference and esteem that should be reserved for our closest allies.\" \n \n The Arizona Republican, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that Putin \"chose to make Russia unworthy of membership in the G-8 by invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea. Nothing he has done since then has changed that most obvious fact. Every day, Russian-led separatist forces are killing Ukrainians in the Donbass. Every day, Putin's forces are helping the Assad regime slaughter the Syrian people. And every day, through assassinations, cyber-attacks, and malign influence, Russia is assaulting democratic institutions all over the world.\" \n \n The statement added, \"Those nations that share our values and have sacrificed alongside us for decades are being treated with contempt. This is the antithesis of so-called 'principled realism' and a sure path to diminishing America's leadership in the world.\" \n \n Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, also a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, \"Putin is not our friend and he is not the President's buddy. He is a thug using Soviet-style aggression to wage a shadow war against America, and our leaders should act like it.\" \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump was turning US foreign policy \"into an international joke, doing lasting damage to our country.\" \n \n Former Vice President Joe Biden also criticized Trump's remarks , writing on Twitter, \"Putin's Russia invaded its neighbors, violated our sovereignty by undermining elections, and attacks dissidents abroad. Yet our President wants to reward him with a seat at the table while alienating our closest democratic allies. It makes no sense.\" \n \n The comment not only surprised American allies and politicians, but Trump's own National Security Council staff. \n \n A National Security Council official told reporters in Quebec Trump's comments were not planned. \n \n When asked about whether there was a potential for a summit between Russian President Putin and President Trump, the official said there have been no discussions in terms of when, where or what that summit might look like. The official added that there was some chatter, but it's not something the NSC is working on internally. \n \n Acrimonious start to G7 \n \n Trump's comments also come at a time when Trump is on the outs with other members of the G7. On Thursday, Trump engaged in a bitter back-and-forth with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over Twitter, both of whom he'll meet face-to-face on Friday. \n \n Trump is expecting a knock-down, drag-out fight with top US allies over trade during his time at the conference, held in remote Quebec. It's a battle he believes he can win, but which he's unenthusiastic about waging in person, people familiar with his thinking say. \n \n On Thursday, Macron said the leaders would not rule out a 6+1 communique as opposed to the traditional document signed by all leaders at the end of the summit with shared goals and principles. \n \n One G7 leader, however, quickly backed Trump's statement: Italy's newly sworn in Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, who said it would be in \"everyone's interest\" for Russia to be reinstated. \n \n Although Conte, a former law professor, has not voiced particularly strong opinions on Russia in the past, his two deputies -- the leader of the Five Star movement and the far-right League Party, who have considered influence over him -- have frequently expressed pro-Russia views.",

She woke up naked being touched by Bill Cosby, she told MailOnline \n \n Speaking out: Chloe Goins is the latest woman to speak of being drugged and attacked by Cosby. However her case is so recent that it is not covered by any statutes of limitation, which affects other allegations \n \n Venue: Cosby has long been a regular at the Playboy Mansion in Beverley Hills, where Hugh Hefner, his longtime friend, has been holding parties since the 1960s \n \n She claims Cosby spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her to a bedroom in the Playboy mansion where he sexually assaulted her. \n \n Goins says she wants the star to 'pay' for all the women he has allegedly attacked and is coming forward to bring them justice. \n \n In California sexual assault carries a maximum 48 months jail sentence, as well as a possible $10,000 fine, depending on mitigating and aggravating factors. \n \n Goins' lawyer has told MailOnline has already made contact with the LAPD and Goins will likely meet with detectives to give a statement in the coming days. \n \n Goins, a model and lap dancer originally from San Diego but currently working in Las Vegas, says she felt compelled to come forward to add her voice to the dozens of women who have already made allegations against Cosby, 78. \n \n She said reading some of the victim's accounts in the media brought back the chilling memories of that night. \n \n This weekend Cosby broke his silence to say that he wants the 'black media' to 'stay neutral' \n \n 'Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,' Cosby told Page Six. \n \n He also praised his wife for her 'love and strength'. \n \n However he now faces fresh allegations of recent misconduct which are being made to the LAPD. \n \n Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Goins, now 24, said she was attacked after a girlfriend invited her to one of Hugh Hefner's infamous summer parties in 2008. \n \n Both were living in Las Vegas at the time and traveled to Los Angeles. \n \n Friends: Hefner and Cosby have been close since the 1960s but last weekend the Playboy creator issued a statement distancing himself from the comedian, saying of the allegations: 'The mere thought is saddening.' \n \n She recalls: 'My girlfriend got an invite to a Playboy party and asked me to go with her. I remember being excited about it. \n \n 'We stayed at the W Hotel in Hollywood which is one of my favorites and were both looking forward to the party. We got all dressed up, we were going to the Playboy mansion after all. \n \n 'I was a wearing a cute little red dress and my friend was wearing a strapless tan dress. \n \n 'I remember we got to the house and it was like a bigger party so there was a lot going on, lots of girls wearing not very much. \n \n 'They checked our ID at the door so I knew drinking was off limits.' \n \n Goins says the party was in full swing when they arrived at the mansion at around 11pm. \n \n Within a few minutes of walking in they were introduced to Hugh Hefner himself. \n \n 'We were running late but we were quickly introduced to Hef when we got there. It was the first time I had met him, I was excited and all focus was on him. Me and my friend were two cute blondes, he liked us. \n \n 'We were talking to Hef for a while and that's when Bill Cosby walked up. I kind of recognized him from TV, I know he was on a TV show where he played a family guy, but he was a little bit before my time. \n \n 'Hef introduced him as his good friend, they seemed really close. He seemed like a really nice guy, really funny. \n \n 'We were talking, laughing and having fun.' \n \n Police: Chloe Goins is to make a statement to detectives after her lawyer made contact with the Los Angeles Police Department. She said she feels all the woman affected by Cosby deserve 'justice' \n \n Under pressure: Cosby has now been accused by 25 women of attacking him. One also alleged that he also attacked 12 Playboy Bunnies who have not come forward in public \n \n As the conversation began to flow Goins remembers Cosby giving her lots of attention. \n \n Then when Hef was in the middle of telling a story, Cosby slipped away and came back with two drinks for the girls. \n \n Goins said: 'He kind of just left and we were talking and he came back with drinks. He gave me a vodka mixer I think. \n \n 'I wasn't really supposed to drink because of my age but I was like, 'okay, cool'. I thought I'd got a drink on the side. \n \n 'I remember the drink being kind of strong but it didn't taste funny or anything like that. \n \n 'I think I finished most of it, I didn't set my glass down I was holding it the whole time.' \n \n But then out of nowhere Chloe claims she began to feel 'dizzy' and unsteady on her feet. \n \n 'Everything kind of went a little foggy, I started feeling sick to my stomach, and just dizzy,' she said. \n \n 'I started telling my friend and I was like where's the bathroom, but I could tell my friend just wanted to hang out, we were still talking to Hef.' \n \n At that point Hefner, realizing Goins wasn't feeling well, offered the use of one of his many spare bedrooms so she could lie down. \n \n Goins said: 'Then Bill offered to show me the room, he said he knew the way. He seemed nice and I don't remember feeling nervous or that it was weird. \n \n 'He had his arm around me to show me the way and I did notice he had been paying me a little more attention than my friend, but never thought anything of it.' \n \n That was the last thing Goins remembers. She doesn't recall entering the room. \n \n She claims she woke up completely naked on a bed and alleges Cosby was hunched over her licking her toes. She knew she was still in the Playboy mansion because she could hear music playing. \n \n Disturbingly, Goins said the then 70-year-old had his trousers around his ankles and was pleasuring himself. \n \n 'I was butt naked lying on my back on a bed and didn't have any idea where I was. \n \n Attack: The Playboy Mansion is where Chloe Goins alleges she was molested in a bedroom by Cosby. She says she was first handed a drugged drink at a party by the comedian, who she thought was a kindly older man \n \n Long association: Hefner and Cosby together. However the Playboy creator has distanced himself from his friend \n \n 'I was in a bedroom and presumed it was in the mansion because I could hear music, I don't think it was Hef's room, it was just a nice room. \n \n 'I came to and remember seeing this big man crouched over me. It was Bill Cosby and he was at my feet, kind of licking and kissing them and I think he bit my toe as that's what woke me up. \n \n 'I kind of thank God for that because that's what woke me up and I came to. \n \n 'I was shocked, I said, 'hey, what's going on', he didn't really say anything, didn't explain anything or give a reason. \n \n 'He jumped up, pulled his pants back up quickly and left. He had seen that I was alert and bolted out of there, I was left in the room by myself.' \n \n Goins said she is sure Cosby had been licking her breasts and groping her body as well. \n \n She said: 'I remember waking up and feeling moist all over, like he had been licking all over me. \n \n 'He wasn't on my breasts when I woke, but I could feel, you know, the saliva on them and that he'd been licking on me. \n \n 'I felt embarrassed, it was a gross, icky feeling, I felt very violated and humiliated. \n \n 'I was scared, I was just 18 and he was an old man, I was not very sexually experienced and I didn't really know what had happened, it was violating.' \n \n Party time: Another 2008 party at the mansion, with Hefner posing with female guests \n \n Goins says she doesn't think she had been raped or molested in any other way, but added: 'I can't be 100% sure what he did to me, I was completely out of it.' \n \n Goins admits she was in a daze when she came around in the bedroom but says she is sure that the man molesting her was comedy legend Bill Cosby. \n \n She said she hadn't been drinking that night other than the vodka drink Cosby had given her. \n \n She also said she had not taken any kind of drugs or medication that night. \n \n 'Someone spiked my drink, I have no doubt about that, it was my first drink of the night,' she said. \n \n After Cosby left the room Goins picked herself off the bed and got dressed. \n \n 'I found my dress but I couldn't find my panties anywhere, I don't know if he had them or not. \n \n 'I just got out of there as fast as I could and found my girlfriend downstairs. \n \n 'She looked at me and said I didn't seem right so she was like, 'let's go'. I think she could tell something was wrong. \n \n On the way back to the hotel Chloe confided in her friend and told her what had happened. \n \n 'I told her I was scared and didn't know what to do, I told her I didn't think I had been raped, but what happened to me wasn't right, at the very least he was groping and molesting me. \n \n 'She consoled me and said she felt bad about it, but neither of us thought about telling anyone.' \n \n Goins said she had always wanted to be a model and singer from a young age and had aspired to appear in Playboy magazine. \n \n Playboy victim: Former Playboy bunny Carla Ferrigno in circa 1980 in Los Angeles, California, with her husband, actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. She claims Cosby assaulted her too \n \n Another Playboy victim: Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy Playmate in 1963, has come out to say Bill Cosby raped her as well. \n \n 'We were young, we wanted to be Playboy models. I was scared about saying anything about what happened, especially as it was at the Playboy mansion because it's known for naughty stuff. \n \n 'I didn't want to get in trouble and maybe ruin my modeling career and nor did my friend as she was getting the invites to the parties. \n \n 'Bill Cosby was on TV and had a family man image, I thought to hurt that, he would come after me, try to ruin me.' \n \n Unsurprisingly, Goins has never been back to the Playboy mansion since. \n \n She says the experience changed her view of men and she finds it hard to trust. \n \n This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself, but I saw all the women who had come forward, over 20 women and it grossed me out. I feel he needs to pay for it, he deserves to pay for it. I don't think he raped me so I am one of the lucky ones, but at the same time it was a f***ed up situation.' Chloe Goins \n \n Goins said: 'It's definitely messed up my sexuality and how I look at men, I have a very hard time trusting them, so yes it has traumatized me.' \n \n Goins says she feels strongly that her and other women should have the courage to come forward. \n \n 'I confided in a friend one night and he said I should come forward,' she explained. \n \n 'I never really thought about it before, but I definitely want to give a statement to the police. \n \n 'This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself, but I saw all the women who had come forward, over 20 women and it grossed me out. I feel he needs to pay for it, he deserves to pay for it. \n \n 'Unlike many of those women, I don't think he raped me so I am one of the lucky ones, but at the same time it was a f***ed up situation.' \n \n The MailOnline has interviewed the friend who was with Goins at the Playboy mansion that night and she has confirmed Goins' version of events. \n \n The friend has asked not to be identified for this article. She said it was her who had invited Goins to the party in LA as her plus one. \n \n The friend, who is a few years older than Goins and was also an aspiring model, recalled: 'I had been to the mansion before and I invited Chloe this time. Through my friends we were talking with Hef and that's when Bill Cosby came over. \n \n 'He got us drinks and we were talking away and that's when Chloe started to feel unwell.' \n \n The friend says Hefner said he had a room which Goins could use to have a lie down. When she agreed to go to the room Cosby piped up and offered to show her where it was. \n \n The friend said: 'Even though I've been there a few times I don't know the mansion very well, but Bill Cosby seemed like he did. \n \n 'He was being nice, he was very old, I thought he was taking care of her and Hef was good with it so I thought, 'wow, that's nice, he's a big celebrity and he's taking care of my friend'. \n \n The friend says 45 minutes to an hour passed but she never thought for a second Goins was in danger. \n \n 'When she came back I knew there was something wrong, that's when I got her out of there and she told me what he did to her. \n \n 'I can't say what happened in that room, I wasn't there, but Chloe is a good friend.' \n \n She added: 'I feel bad about the whole thing, I'm the one who took her there. I feel bad because I didn't take care of her that night.' \n \n 'Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved Hugh Hefner last weekend \n \n Cosby is currently being investigated by police over rape and drug allegations as one of his 20 accusers filed a police report. \n \n Two detectives met with Judy Huth who claims the revered entertainer drugged and raped her at Hugh Hefner's mansion in 1974 when she was 15. \n \n Her accusation prompted Cosby's lawyers to file a lawsuit against Huth branding her a liar. \n \n But earlier this month the now-55-year-old responded by filing a police report which has sparked an LAPD investigation. \n \n Huth is not the only accuser to claim she was attacked at the Playboy mansion. \n \n Then, former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten claimed she was given a drugged drink and raped by Cosby at the Playboy Club in Chicago in 1979. \n \n Masten said she believes there are other former Bunnies who are too ashamed to come forward with their own stories. \n \n Earlier this month, Hugh Hefner released a statement about the allegations against Cosby and his personal connection. \n \n 'Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening,' Hefner said. \n \n 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.' \n \n Cosby's lawyer, Marty Singer, did not respond to a request for comment from MailOnline.

We understand she\u2019s a little busy right now. ||||| The Curse of the Billy Goat was a sports-related curse that was supposedly placed on the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in 1945, by Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis. The curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to 2016. Because the odor of his pet goat, named Murphy, was bothering other fans, Sianis was asked to leave Wrigley Field, the Cubs' home ballpark, during game 4 of the 1945 World Series.[1][2] Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,\" which had been interpreted to mean that the Cubs would never win another National League (NL) pennant (at least for the remainder of Sianis's life). \n \n The Cubs lost the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, and did not win a World Series championship again until 2016. The Cubs had last won the World Series in 1908. After the incident with Sianis and Murphy, the Cubs did not play in the World Series for the next 71 years until, on the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis's death,[3] the \"curse\" was broken when they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5\u20130 in game 6 of the 2016 National League Championship Series to win the NL pennant.[4] The Cubs then defeated the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians 8\u20137 in 10 innings in game 7 to win the 2016 World Series, 108 years after their last win.[5] \n \n Origins of the curse [ edit ] \n \n The exact nature of Sianis's curse differs in various accounts of the incident. Some state that he declared that no World Series games would ever again be played at Wrigley Field, while others believe that his ban was on the Cubs appearing in the World Series, making no mention of a specific venue. Sianis\u2019s family claims that he dispatched a telegram to team owner Philip K. Wrigley which read, \u201cYou are going to lose this World Series and you are never going to win another World Series again. You are never going to win a World Series again because you insulted my goat.\u201d[6][7] \n \n Whatever the truth, the Cubs were up two games to one in the 1945 Series, but ended up losing Game 4, as well as the best-of-seven series, four games to three. The curse was immortalized in newspaper columns over the years, particularly by syndicated columnist Mike Royko. The curse gained widespread attention during the 2003 postseason, when Fox television commentators played it up during the Cubs-Marlins matchup in the National League Championship Series (NLCS).[8] According to an account in the Chicago Sun of October 7, 1945, the goat was turned away at the gate, and Sianis left the goat tied to a stake in a parking lot and went into the game alone. There was mention of a lawsuit that day, but no mention of a curse. \n \n Between that 1908 triumph, which was the Cubs' second world championship (they'd also won the Series in 1907 to become baseball's first back-to-back winners as well as the first franchise to appear in three consecutive World Series), and 1945, the first year of the alleged Billy Goat curse, the Cubs won the National League pennant six times but failed to win the Series: in 1910, in 1918 (won by the Boston Red Sox who themselves would soon become victims of an alleged baseball curse and not win another Series for 86 years), in 1929, in 1932 (known for Babe Ruth's called shot at Wrigley Field), in 1935 (a re-match of the 1908 series against the Detroit Tigers, with the Tigers winning this time, their first Series triumph in five appearances dating back to the early 1900s), and in 1938. \n \n Alleged curse incidents [ edit ] \n \n On September 9, 1969, at Shea Stadium, the Cubs played the New York Mets in a critical pennant race game. A stray black cat walked between Cubs captain Ron Santo, who was on deck, and the Cubs dugout. The Mets would pull ahead of the Cubs in that series and eventually win both the newly formed NL East and the 1969 World Series.[9] \n \n In 1984, the Cubs\u2019 postseason appearance was dashed by the San Diego Padres. The Cubs were victorious in the first two games of the best-of-five series. However, in game five, first baseman Leon Durham let a ground ball get past his allegedly wet glove in the bottom of the seventh inning. The Padres went on to score four runs to win the game and the series.[10] \n \n In 1989, the Cubs won 93 games and faced the San Francisco Giants in the National League Championship Series, now a best-of-seven series. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses. \n \n In 1998, behind NL MVP Sammy Sosa, the Cubs won the Wild Card after winning a tiebreaker game vs the Giants. However, they were swept in the National League Division Series by the Atlanta Braves. \n \n On October 14, 2003, in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the NLCS, with Chicago ahead 3\u20130 and holding a three games to two lead in the best of seven series, several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo. One of the fans, Steve Bartman, reached for the ball, deflecting it and disrupting a potential catch by Cubs outfielder Mois\u00e9s Alou. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first National League pennant since 1945. Instead, the Cubs ended up surrendering eight runs in the inning and losing the game, 8\u20133. When they were eliminated in the seventh game the next day, the incident was seen as the \"first domino\" in the turning point of the series.[11] \n \n The Cubs won their division in both 2007 and 2008, but were swept in the NLDS both years by the Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers respectively. \n \n In 2015, the Cubs finished second in the National League Wild Card race and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the Wild Card Game and the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS to advance to the NLCS against the New York Mets. However, the Cubs batted an NLCS record low of .164 and lost the series in a 4-game sweep. (The Cubs thus became the first team ever to get swept in a playoff series by a team they swept in their regular season series.) \n \n Sianis's goat was named Murphy. In the 2015 National League Championship Series, this was referenced by fans of the New York Mets, who joked that Daniel Murphy, the Mets second baseman and series MVP, was \"not the first GOAT (Greatest of All Time, in reference to Murphy's postseason heroics to that point) named Murphy to keep the Cubs out of the World Series\".[12] \n \n Attempts to break the curse [ edit ] \n \n Prior to his death on October 22, 1970, Billy Sianis himself attempted to lift the curse. Sam Sianis, his nephew, has gone to Wrigley Field with a goat multiple times in attempts to break the curse, including on Opening Day in 1984 and again in 1989, both years in which the Cubs went on to win their division. In 1994, Sam Sianis went again, with a goat, to stop a home losing streak, and in 1998 for the Wild Card tie-breaker game, which the Cubs won.[13] \n \n In 2003 (the Chinese zodiac's Year of the Goat), a group of Cubs fans headed to Houston with a billy goat named \"Virgil Homer\" and attempted to gain entrance to Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, division rivals of the Cubs at the time.[14] After they were denied entrance, they unfurled a scroll, read a verse and proclaimed they were \"reversing the curse\". The Cubs won the division that year and then came within five outs of playing in the World Series, but were undone by the Florida Marlins' eight-run rally immediately following the Steve Bartman incident. The Cubs then lost the following game and with it the series. (The Marlins went on to win the World Series against the New York Yankees.) Further salting the wound, the Astros earned their first World Series berth two years later and their crosstown rival the Chicago White Sox won the series. \n \n On February 26, 2004, at the Harry Caray Restaurant in downtown Chicago, the Bartman baseball was electrocuted in an attempt to break the curse, leaving nothing but a heap of string behind. \n \n In another bizarre twist, it was reported that a butchered goat was hung from the Harry Caray statue on October 3, 2007, to which The Chicago Sun-Times noted: \"If the prankster intended to reverse the supposed billy goat curse with the stunt, it doesn't appear to have worked.\"[15] While the Cubs did win the NL Central division title in 2007 and 2008, they were swept in the first round of the postseason in both years: by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2007 and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008. The elimination by Arizona came on October 6, the same date that the goat appeared at Wrigley Field in 1945.[16] The act was repeated before the home opener in 2009, this time a goat's butchered head being hung from the statue. The act was futile as the Cubs were eliminated from postseason contention on September 26, 2009.[17] \n \n In 2008, a Greek Orthodox priest sought to end the curse during the 2008 playoffs with a spraying of holy water in and around the Cubs dugout to no avail.[18] \n \n On April 1, 2011, a social enterprise called Reverse The Curse, dedicated to bringing innovations to poverty by giving goats to families in developing countries, was initiated.[19] The goats provide the family with milk, cheese, and alternative income to help lift them out of poverty. Reverse The Curse has expanded into reversing the \"curses\" that afflict the world's children in education and obesity. \n \n On February 25, 2012, a group of five Chicago Cubs fans calling themselves Crack the Curse set out on foot from Mesa, Arizona (home to the Cubs' spring training facilities) to Wrigley Field. They brought along a goat named Wrigley whom they believed would be able to break the Curse of the Billy Goat upon arrival at Wrigley Field. Additionally, they attempted to raise $100,000 for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.[20] \n \n On April 10, 2013, a severed goat's head was delivered to the Cubs in a possible effort to lift the curse on the team. It was addressed to the club's owner Thomas S. Ricketts.[21] \n \n On September 22, 2015, Patrick Bertoletti, Tim Brown, Takeru Kobayashi, Kevin Strahle and Bob Shoudt consumed a 40-pound goat in 13 minutes and 22 seconds at Taco in a Bag restaurant in Chicago.[22] \n \n On October 7, 2016, the owners of The Chicago Diner, a local vegetarian eatery near Wrigley Field, teamed up with Farm Sanctuary to try to reverse the Curse of the Billy Goat by displaying posters in the windows at their locations. The posters feature a goat named Peanut who urges Chicagoans to \u201creverse the curse\u201d by going meat-free.[23] \n \n Former Cubs who won a World Series title elsewhere [ edit ] \n \n Another factor that may play a role in the curse is the number of players (42 of them are listed below) who won World Series titles after leaving the Cubs (known as the Ex-Cubs Factor). These players include Andy Pafko (who, coincidentally, played in the 1945 World Series as a member of the Cubs), Gene Baker, Smoky Burgess, Don Hoak, Dale Long, Lou Brock (whose first title was in 1964 after a mid-season trade to the St. Louis Cardinals), Lou Johnson, Jim Brewer, Moe Drabowsky, Don Cardwell, Ken Holtzman, Paul Noce, Billy North, Fred Norman, Bill Madlock, Manny Trillo, Greg Gross, Rick Monday, Burt Hooton, Bruce Sutter, Willie Hern\u00e1ndez, Milt Wilcox, Joe Niekro, Dennis Eckersley, Joe Carter, Greg Maddux, Joe Girardi (as both a player and a manager), Jos\u00e9 Vizca\u00edno, Glenallen Hill (after his second stint with the Cubs; his title came in 2000 after a mid-season trade), Luis Gonzalez, Mike Morgan, Mark Grace, Mark Bellhorn, Bill Mueller, Scott Eyre (whose title came in 2008 after he had been traded from the Cubs during the season), Tom Gordon, Matt Stairs, Jamie Moyer, Mark DeRosa, Mike Fontenot, Ryan Theriot, \u00c1ngel Pag\u00e1n, and, in 2013, Ryan Dempster. Dontrelle Willis and Jon Garland were traded as minor leaguers (coincidentally, the former won a World Series ring with the Marlins team that defeated the Cubs in the 2003 NLCS). Tim Lincecum, who went on to win three World Series titles, was originally drafted by the Cubs, but he did not sign with them.[24] \n \n End of the curse [ edit ] \n \n The Cubs ended the 2016 season with a 103\u201358 (.640) record. It was their first 100-win season since 1935 ( 100\u201354 , .649), their best since 1910 ( 104\u201350 , .675), and the sixth 100-win season in franchise history. \n \n The Cubs won the National League Championship Series (NLCS), their first pennant in 71 years, with a 5\u20130 shutout in Game 6 against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field on October 22, 2016, the \"curse\" was broken on the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis's death.[3][4] \n \n The Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians play Game 7 of the 2016 World Series in Cleveland on November 2, 2016. The Cubs won, ending their 108-year losing streak. \n \n In 2016, the Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908, ending the historic 108-year drought. \n \n The Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series in seven games after trailing in the series 3 games to 1. They won game 7 by a score of 8\u20137 in 10 innings at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio.[5] \n \n See also [ edit ] \n \n Cookies for sale in Chicago during the 2016 season",

See photos here. \u2013 It's been 108 years since the Chicago Cubs last won the World Series, but the Curse of the Billy Goat is still hanging in the air. The MLB team's curse was supposedly put in place by Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis in 1945 after fans asked him to leave Wrigley Field because his pet goat, Murphy, was bothering them, Deadspin reports. Sianis allegedly said, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.\" The Cubs lost that World Series and didn't win a championship again until 2016. The curse was broken in 2016 when the Cubs beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series. According to Deadspin, Sianis' family claims he sent a telegram to Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley saying, \"You are going to lose this WorldSeries and you are never going to win another World Series again. You are never gonna win a WorldSeries again because you insulted my goat.\" But the Cubs were up two games to one in the 1945 Series, and ended up losing Game 4, as well as the best-of-seven series, four games to three. The curse gained widespread attention during the 2003 postseason, when Fox television commentators played it up during the Cubs-Marlins matchup in the \u2013 The Chicago Cubs haven't been to the World Series since 1945\u2014and they're still looking for their first championship in 108 years. The team was swept by the New York Mets in this year's NLCS, marking the first time in history that a team has been swept in the playoffs by a team it already beat in the regular season, reports the Chicago Tribune. The Cubs have lost four straight NLCS games since 2003, including two in which they led 3-1 in the eighth inning and lost in extra innings. The curse was referenced during the 2003 playoffs, when a fan named Steve Bartman reached for a foul ball and deflected it away from Cubs outfielder Mois\u00e9s Alou, who would have been the second out of the inning if he had caught it, reports USA Today. Instead, the Cubs ended up giving up eight runs in the inning and losing the game, 8-3, and the series, which the Cubs eventually lost in seven games. (Here's how the curse came to be known.) \u2013 The Chicago Cubs haven't been to the World Series since 1945\u2014and they're still waiting. That's because of what's known as the \"Billy Goat\" curse, which has been hanging around Wrigley Field since Billy Sianis, Billy's nephew, brought a goat to the park on Opening Day in 1984, the Chicago Tribune reports. Sianis' nephew Sam Sianis has gone to Wrigley Field with a goat in an attempt to break the curse multiple times, including in 1989, when the Cubs won their division and went on to win the National League Championship Series. In 2003, a group of Cubs fans traveled to Houston with a billy goat named \"Virgil Homer\" and attempted to get into Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, division rivals of the Cubs at the time. After they were denied entrance, they unfurled a scroll, read a verse, and proclaimed they were \"reversing the curse.\" In another bizarre twist, a butchered goat was hung from the Harry Caray statue on October 3, 2007, to which the Chicago Sun-Times noted: \"If the prankster intended to reverse the supposed billy Goat curse with the stunt, it doesn't appear to have worked.\" The Cubs were swept in the first round of the \u2013 It's been 108 years since the Chicago Cubs won the World Series, but they haven't been back since\u2014and that's put a curse on the city of Chicago. As USA Today explains, the Curse of the Billy Goat has been attached to the team since Billy Sianis, the goat's owner, died in 1972. Sianis' death was commemorated on Oct. 22, 2016, the same day the Cubs won Game 7 of the 2016 World Series\u2014ending their 108-year losing streak. Since then, a number of Chicagoans have gone so far as to eat a 40-pound goat in 13 minutes and 22 seconds in an attempt to break the curse, and a group called Crack the Curse set out to bring a goat named Wrigley to Wrigley Field in 2012 to see if that would be the end of the curse. The group attempted to raise $100,000 for a cancer research center by having the severed head of a goat delivered to the Cubs in 2013, and they even had the goat on display at a Chicago diner as part of a campaign to \"reverse the curse.\" But, as USA Today notes, it's not all bad news for Chicago. The curse has also been linked to the number of players who have won World Series titles after leaving the Cubs (",

Duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth. She had abrasions and lacerations on her right arm and left leg, and her right arm was fractured. She had an incision wound on her neck that the report said was likely inflicted after she died. \n \n Her body was found in the garage, along with that of the Anderson family dog, which had been shot. Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze in the garage when they arrived the night of Aug. 4. \n \n Ethan\u2019s body was found in the charred remains of the separate two-story house, which was fully engulfed when firefighters arrived. The autopsy said Ethan most likely died due to the fire, but that he also had skeletal fractures, and trauma could not be ruled out as a possible cause of the fractures. \n \n Ethan\u2019s body had been so badly burned that authorities earlier said he had to be identified through DNA. His father, Brett Anderson, said earlier that his DNA was used. \n \n DiMaggio, 40, was shot and killed by FBI agents in an Idaho wilderness on Aug. 10, six days after Hannah was abducted. She was rescued by the agents and returned to her family. \n \n Sheriff\u2019s homicide Lt. Glenn Giannantonio said Monday that sheriff\u2019s officials had no comment on the autopsy reports and would not be releasing further information about their investigation.",

    "document": "As Americans carefully separate the paper and plastics from their trash, most probably don\u2019t realize that their country doesn\u2019t recycle stuff so much as export it to be recycled elsewhere. Specifically, to China. For more than five years, scrap and trash has consistently been the US\u2019s biggest export (paywall), for which China is the number one customer, and the market has doubled in size since 2006. \n \n \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t realize this, but recycling is made possible by technology and markets\u2014they think it\u2019s just a matter of technology,\u201d an industry insider with expertise in China\u2019s waste management told Quartz. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have strong enough markets in the US.\u201d \n \n But hints are emerging that American cities and the companies that sell trash are in for a rude awakening. A recent sign of this comes from Oregon, where truckloads of plastic are piling up at recycling depots because Chinese buyers cancelled their orders, as Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. \n \n And it\u2019s not just plastic from Oregon. American waste recycling companies are starting to panic. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from folks in the industry, it\u2019s that just that nothing is going,\u201d the industry insider says. \u201c[China\u2019s] not taking anything anymore. It\u2019s a greenwall.\u201d \n \n What\u2019s going on is this: the Chinese government just launched Operation Green Fence, forbidding the import of certain types of solid waste, including unwashed plastics and other illegal waste mixed in with the good stuff. This is a problem for the US because China is the primary source of demand for its to-be-recycled plastic exports (pdf): \n \n Resource Recycling, Portland OR China\u2019s share of US exports of plastics for recycling. PE\u2014polyethylene; PS\u2014polystyrene; PVC\u2014polyvinyl chloride; PET\u2014polyethylene terephthalate \n \n Of course, you can\u2019t always tell how serious a Chinese government ban will be, and it\u2019s not even clear why China would come down so aggressively. Despite its \u201ctrash mountain\u201d woes, it actually needs the plastic resin for manufacturing. \n \n Regardless, Green Fence looks like the real deal. Chinese ports have turned away \u201cforeign garbage\u201d by the hundreds upon thousands of tons (links in Chinese). \u201cIf China customs found a syringe, even if it\u2019s just one, in a bale of plastic, it\u2019s considered medical waste and the whole shipment would get rejected,\u201d Peter Wang, CEO of recycling exporter America Chung Nam said at a conference recently. \n \n The US\u2019s reliance on China to buy up its plastic trash has meant that it\u2019s neglected to keep developing its own plastic recycling capacity, as you can see: \n \n Resource Recycling, Portland OR New PE recycling plants opened by region. \n \n The drop-off in Chinese demand, and the lack of immediately accessible alternatives, could hit American cities hard, says Quartz\u2019s contact in the industry. \u201cCities are going to have a huge problem on their hands because they don\u2019t know what to do with this stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have made commitments saying it\u2019s recycled\u2014but they didn\u2019t say how or where.\u201d \n \n Not that the US couldn\u2019t open new plants. But sorting trash to be recycled is labor-intensive, and therefore expensive. (The US\u2019s failure to sort it properly is why China is turning US trash away.) And while optical sorters exist, those are expensive too. And either will raise costs for US cities. ||||| Oregon recyclers have stopped accepting certain kinds of plastic because China has stopped buying them. \n \n Chinese recyclers are no longer buying plastic items with the numbers 3, 6 or 7 on them, and inspectors are checking for and rejecting shipments of mixed plastics from overseas. The list of plastics China no longer wants includes disposable coffee cup lids, PVC pipes, certain kinds of clamshell containers, and garden planters with flexible walls, to name a few. \n \n The restrictions have left recycling companies across U.S. without buyers for many of the plastics they have traditionally accepted. They don\u2019t affect curbside recycling items like milk jugs and yogurt tubs, but they are limiting which miscellaneous plastics recycling depots will accept. \n \n Far West Fibers president Keith Ristau said 50 trucks worth of mixed plastic from his company\u2019s recycling depots has piled up after orders from China were canceled. It will need to be re-sorted into individual types of plastic before it can be sold, as will the plastics are now being collected at recycling depots. \n \n \u201cWe used to have just one big bin at our depots, and you threw all the plastics in there, and we just baled it and shipped it to China,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have to sort it by the specific resin, so we have four or five bins instead of one.\u201d \n \n Far West Fibers and other Portland-area recyclers are meeting with officials at Metro next week to find new buyers for the recyclable plastics China won\u2019t take. \n \n Metro recycling manager Andy Sloop said there are still good markets for the kinds of plastics accepted in curbside recycling programs. \n \n \u201cWhat\u2019s mostly at issue is low-grade, mixed, rigid plastics that aren\u2019t supposed to go into curbside bins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s things like lids and toys and swimming pools.

This, it turns out, is a huge deal because trash has for years been one of the top American exports to China, explains the Washington Post.

Video by Guy Wood \n \n \u00a9 Yiftah Elazar \n \n When Joshua Vandiver GS met Henry Velandia, his future husband, in 2006, he never imagined that he would be fighting to save him from deportation less than four years later. \n \n Vandiver and Velandia were married Aug. 29 in Connecticut. But Velandia\u2019s application for a work visa was denied and his current visa has expired, which means that he now risks being deported to Venezuela, his home country. \n \n Typically, foreigners married to American citizens can obtain green cards through sponsorship from their spouses. But the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act defined marriage as the union between a man and a woman for all federal laws, including immigration regulations. The law means that no member of a same-sex married couple can sponsor a spouse\u2019s application for legal residency. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to find my passion and the love of my life, yet still run the risk of deportation,\u201d Velandia said.

Rush Holt, who was on campus to speak at an event sponsored by College Democrats and Tigers for Israel. During a question-and-answer session following Holt\u2019s speech, Vandiver asked Holt to appeal to the Department of Homeland Security to cease deportations of spouses of U.S. citizens while debate on the Defense of Marriage Act continues. Holt said that he was opposed to the law and was in support of gay rights. \n \n Vandiver, who is from Colorado, received his undergraduate degree from Harvard, spent a year at Oxford and is now in his sixth year of study for his Ph.D. in the politics department at Princeton. \n \n Velandia, who met Vandiver online, emigrated from Venezuela in 2002. \u201cI started from zero in this country \u2014 new language, new culture,\u201d he said. \n \n In the United States, Velandia took up salsa dancing and founded his own dance school, HotSalsaHot.

A man who answered at that number Wednesday confirmed his first name matched that of the Facebook post, but he then quickly hung up. \n \n On the FIU Pike chapter\u0092s official public Facebook page, a contact number is listed, but no one answered repeated calls Wednesday. \n \n In a brief written statement, the Pike fraternity\u0092s national headquarters in Tennessee said it \u0093had no previous knowledge of this Facebook group\u0094 and was informed of its existence on Tuesday. \n \n \u0093The international fraternity has been assured of the chapter\u0092s full compliance with the temporary suspension and subsequent investigation,\u0094 according to the statement. \n \n FIU released its own statement Wednesday, saying it was recently made aware of the postings and is investigating possible violations of the university\u0092s code of student conduct. The university\u0092s on-campus police are also involved, FIU said. \n \n \u0093The university is taking this information very seriously As a result, the fraternity has been instructed to cease all meetings and events,\u0094 FIU wrote. A university spokesperson said it was the anonymous email that sparked FIU\u0092s investigation. \n \n Among the Facebook screenshots are several showing photos of topless women who were apparently dating Pike members. In one, someone writes that the girl was 17 years old at the time. \n \n Other posts belittle classmates. Rival fraternities are repeatedly described using anti-gay slurs, and members of one sorority are described as \u0093the biggest sluts on campus.\u0094 \n \n The Facebook posts also frequently criticize women whom the frat members perceive as overweight. Several posters stressed that Pikes were only allowed to sell fraternity-affiliated T-shirts to thin women. \n \n And some posts appear to take pride in unsportsmanlike conduct during soccer games against other fraternities. One post notes the Pike team has been losing points in the soccer league because of its lack of sportsmanship \u0097 particularly in heckling players from the opposing team. But the writer notes that sportsmanship points only become a factor in the case of a tie breaker, so they can safely be ignored. \n \n \u0093Since we are not going to lose any games, then we don\u0092t need that tie-breaker,\u0094 he wrote. \n \n This week\u0092s suspension is but the latest round of discipline for a fraternity that has repeatedly gotten in trouble \u0097 both locally and nationally. The FIU chapter was already on probation from an incident in June involving serving alcohol to a pledge. Since 2006, Pike has been found guilty of a variety of offenses: underage drinking, conducting drinking games, throwing eggs at a rival fraternity\u0092s house and breaking a student\u0092s car windshield while also painting obscene words and pictures on the vehicle. \n \n The penalties leveled against Pike have included suspensions, community service hours, and requiring the fraternity to make a $1,500 donation to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. \n \n At the University of Tennessee, a student ended up in the hospital last year in critical condition after participating in a \u0093butt-chugging\u0094 party at UT\u0092s Pike house. Students there were inserting a tube in their anus and then funneling in alcoholic beverages \u0097 a practice that can be deadly. \n \n Susan Lipkins, a Long Island psychologist and author who is an expert on hazing and Greek organizations, said universities often turn a blind eye to the misbehavior of these groups. The reasons, Lipkins said: Fraternities and sororities create an atmosphere that helps colleges attract new students, and Greek students tend to be more generous in donating to their alma mater after graduation. The construction of frat houses also provides colleges with extra on-campus housing that they need, she said. \n \n The Facebook posts at FIU, Lipkins said, reflect larger problems with the culture of Greek life. \n \n \u0093They are definitely not the exception,\u0094 Lipkins said. \u0093They are the rule.\u0094 \n \n Other FIU fraternities have also been disciplined. In 2002, FIU suspended the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity for paddling students \u0097 an act of hazing so severe that one student was seen limping on a swollen left leg. Though the hazing mentioned in the Pike Facebook posts isn\u0092t as extreme \u0097 pledges were forced to wash cars, for example \u0097 Lipkins said that doesn\u0092t mean more-severe hazing wasn\u0092t happening. \n \n Pike members at times discussed the group\u0092s reputation. One posted that Pike didn\u0092t have a PR problem because sorority girls are \u0093dying\u0094 to hook up with Pike brothers. In the days after the Boston Marathon bombings, another member had this suggestion: \n \n \u0093Guys please put up the PIKE Prays for Boston Banner that\u0092s upstairs outside so that when people start arriving tomorrow morning they see it,\u0094 he wrote. \u0093This is excellent publicity!\u0094 ||||| Early Saturday morning, an unresponsive University of Tennessee student was dropped off at a medical center with a blood alcohol content that local police say was \u201cwell over .40,\u201d the point at which death can occur. How did the 20-year-old student get that dangerously drunk? \n \n Campus police went to the student\u2019s fraternity house, Pi Kappa Alpha (aka Pike), to find out. They found several males intoxicated or passed out \u2014 and this scene, as described by a Knoxville police spokesman in a Monday statement that was obtained by The Post: \u201cUpon extensive questioning it is believed that members of the fraternity were utilizing rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol as the abundance of capillaries and blood vessels present greatly heightens the level and speed of the alcohol entering the blood stream as it bypasses the filtering by the liver.\u201d \n \n The act of getting wasted in that way is also referred to as \u201cbutt chugging,\u201d \u201calcohol enema\u201d and, well, \u201ccompletely idiotic.\u201d \n \n The Knoxville News Sentinel reported that campus police also found \u201cbags from wine boxes, some empty and some partially empty, strewn across the halls and rooms.\u201d Gawker has since posed the question: \u201cWhite or red, do you think?\u201d \n \n Earlier this week, the university and Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity administratively suspended the chapter for 30 days, pending an investigation into the allegations. In a statement on Tuesday, a top Pike official deemed this an \u201cunfortunate, isolated incident\u201d involving \u201ca small group of individuals.\u201d He added that the incident \u201cis an opportunity to increase the public\u2019s awareness of what appears to be an unfortunate and extremely dangerous practice by some young people today.\u201d \n \n The student\u2019s father is irate that news of his son\u2019s trip to the hospital has made headlines and told the student newspaper, the Daily Beacon, that there \u201care significant errors that have been reported and we will correct them.\u201d The father did not elaborate on what those errors were, but told the paper that his son is back in class and \u201clivid with the defamation of his character.\u201d \n \n On Wednesday afternoon, the university sent me a copy of its 12-page police report from the incident. Here are the pages that include police statements (minus the names of the involved students, which I chose to remove): \n \n This post was updated at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday to include information provided by the university, along with the police report. \n \n For more higher education news, you can follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

    "document": "CNET \n \n Oyster, a subscription service for e-books that launched two years ago, is calling it quits. \n \n The service's founders announced in a company blog post Monday that they will move toward retiring the existing service in the next few months. The blog post did not give a reason for the closure but hinted that there were other ambitions for the service. \n \n \"We believe more than ever that the phone will be the primary reading device globally over the next decade,\" they wrote. \"Looking forward, we feel this is best seized by taking on new opportunities to fully realize our vision for ebooks.\" \n \n Representatives for the New York-based company did not immediate respond to a request for comment. \n \n Google confirmed that it has hired \"a portion of the Oyster team\" to work at Google Play Books but declined to provide further details. A report in Recode said, citing unnamed sources, that the hiring includes Oyster's CEO and two co-founders. Google was not immediately available to comment to CNET. \n \n Oyster, which was founded in 2012 and launched its service a year later, took a novel approach to the e-book market, formerly offering only a subscription book service for $9.95 a month. The idea attracted the attention of Amazon, which last year launched a rival subscription service dubbed Kindle Unlimited that offered all-you-can-eat e-books and audiobooks for $9.99 per month. \n \n Despite Amazon's entry into subscription ebook market, Oyster's model did little to replace traditional book sales, mostly because binge-reading is more difficult than binge-watching movies. Consumers, who are flocking to other subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, appear reluctant to sign up with the equivalent for books. Even Amazon has declined to discuss how well its service is performing. \n \n Oyster, which had raised $17 million, changed its model in April when it announced an expansion into online retail with an e-book store that would sell individual books, with hopes of attracting new customers to its service. \n \n The move came at an auspicious time for the book industry, as publishers have begun setting prices evenly across the e-book market. By expanding into online sales, Oyster was gunning for Amazon, estimated to control more than half the US e-book market and even more abroad. \n \n However, Oyster did make early headway within the book industry by signing up three of the five biggest US publishers, amassing a library of more than 1 million titles. But even these publishers have chosen to wait as long as six months to release their newest titles on subscription services like Oyster. \n \n Oyster users could also only access the service through an app for smartphones, tablets and computers -- but not Amazon's popular Kindle e-reader. (Oyster does have an app for the Amazon's Fire tablet, though). \n \n Update, September 22 at 7:34 a.m. PT: Added information on Google's reported hiring of some Oyster employees. ||||| Oyster, a company that provides a Netflix-like book subscription service, is shutting down. And most of its team is heading over to Google. \n \n In a blog post on Monday, Oyster\u2019s founders said they were \u201ctaking steps to sunset\u201d the company\u2019s service, which launched in 2012. \u201cWe believe more than ever that the phone will be the primary reading device globally over the next decade,\u201d they wrote. \u201cLooking forward, we feel this is best seized by taking on new opportunities to fully realize our vision for e-books.\u201d \n \n Those opportunities may happen at Google. A rep for the search giant confirmed that \u201ca portion\u201d of the Oyster team has joined Google Play Books, its online store for books. People familiar with the company say that CEO Eric Stromberg and co-founders Andrew Brown and Willem Van Lancker are part of the team joining Google. \n \n Google is resistant to the notion that it bought Oyster. But sources said it will end up paying investors, who put a reported $17 million into the company, for the right to hire some of its staff. In other words, this is an \u201cacqhire.\u201d \n \n Google went through this sort of exercise recently. In July, the company swooped in when Homejoy, a startup connecting customers with professional cleaners online, retired. Google hired around 20 of Homejoy\u2019s engineers, as Re/code first reported. Later that month, Google launched an advertising product for professional services that looked remarkably similar to Homejoy\u2019s model. \n \n So does Google want to launch its own version of Oyster\u2019s book subscription? The company declined to comment. If it does launch a service, it will end up competing with Amazon, which launched its own $10-a-month e-book service in July 2014. ||||| It\u2019s not so easy to offer a Netflix-like experience. \n \n The Oyster e-book subscription service that launched with much fanfare in 2013 has posted a note on its blog stating it will be exiting that business over the next few months and offering refunds to subscribers who request them. The service provides access to more than 1 million e-books... ||||| We have REALLY big news for you.

West Virginia law does not require inspections for chemical storage facilities \u2014 only for production facilities. \n \n Some other states do require inspections of chemical storage facilities. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was working with Randy Huffman, the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Protection, to come up with recommendations aimed at avoiding future leaks. \n \n The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Sunday that a team of experts from the United States Chemical Safety Board asked the state three years ago to create a new program to prevent accidents and releases in the Kanawha Valley, known as Chemical Valley. \n \n That came after investigation of the August 2008 explosion and fire that killed two workers at the Bayer CropScience plant in Institute, W.Va. No program was produced, and another team from the same board is expected to arrive Monday to investigate this accident. \n \n Critics say the problems are widespread in a state where the coal and chemical industries, which drive much of West Virginia\u2019s economy and are powerful forces in the state\u2019s politics, have long pushed back against tight federal health, safety and environmental controls. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cWest Virginia has a pattern of resisting federal oversight and what they consider E.P.A. interference, and that really puts workers and the population at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a lecturer in environmental health at George Washington University. \n \n But Mr. Huffman disputed that accusation, noting that West Virginia\u2019s economy is more heavily dependent than other states on the coal and chemical industries. \u201cBased upon the types of industrial activity, how does it compare to the rest of the country? It\u2019s not in context.\u201d Although he added, \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for any incident where someone gets hurt.\u201d \n \n Efforts to clean up the spill showed signs of improvement on Sunday. \n \n \u201cThe numbers look good, and like last night, they are very encouraging,\u201d Governor Tomblin said in a news conference on Sunday. \u201cI believe we\u2019re at a point where we can say we\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d \n \n Officials said tests conducted at a water treatment plant downstream from the site of the leak showed little to no traces of contamination on Sunday morning, allowing testing to move to the next phase. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Once the testing is complete, the water company plans to begin lifting the do-not-use ban by zones. The work will start in downtown Charleston and three other \u201cpriority zones\u201d that include the city\u2019s four major hospitals and 25,000 customers who use more than half of the company\u2019s water, said Jeff McIntyre, the president of West Virginia American Water. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re several days from starting the lift, but I\u2019m saying not today,\u201d Mr. McIntyre said. \n \n Government offices and many businesses planned to reopen on Monday, while many schools in the affected areas would remain closed, officials said. \n \n \u201cStores are open,\u201d said Jimmy Gianato, the state director of homeland security. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get back to normal.\u201d \n \n Emergency rooms have treated about 169 patients for symptoms related to chemical exposure, said Karen Bowling, the state health secretary. Ten people were admitted to three hospitals with symptoms that were not life threatening, she said. \n \n The chemical in last Thursday\u2019s spill was 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM. The leak at the Elk River storage facility came from a ruptured tank storing this chemical, which is used to wash coal. \n \n No charges have been filed against Freedom Industries, the company that owns the plant, but the United States attorney\u2019s office has already begun an investigation into the spill. \n \n \u201cWhenever you have a discharge of a pollutant or a hazardous substance you have potential violation of the environmental laws,\u201d said Booth Goodwin, the United States attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, according to a news report on WVVA.com. \n \n This is not the first chemical accident to hit West Virginia\u2019s Kanawha Valley. \n \n After an explosion at a West Virginia chemical plant owned by Bayer CropScience killed two employees in 2008, a 2010 congressional investigation found that managers refused for several hours to tell emergency responders the nature of the blast or the toxic chemical it released. It also found that they later misused a law intended to keep information from terrorists to try to stop federal investigators from learning what had happened. The plant manufactured the same chemical that was being processed at the time of a gas release in 1984 that killed 10,000 in Bhopal, India. \n \n West Virginia is also no stranger to accidents in the coal industry. \n \n In 2012, federal prosecutors charged David C. Hughart, a top executive at Massey Energy, a West Virginia coal operator, with a felony count and a second misdemeanor conspiracy count related to the deaths of 29 coal miners in a 2009 explosion at West Virginia\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine. Prosecutors said that Mr. Hughart and others knowingly conspired to violate safety laws at Massey\u2019s mines and worked to hide those violations by giving advance warnings of surprise inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. \n \n In 2009, an investigation by The New York Times found that hundreds of workplaces in West Virginia had violated pollution laws without paying fines. In interviews at the time, current and former West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection employees said their enforcement efforts had been undermined by bureaucratic disorganization; a departmental preference to let polluters escape punishment if they promised to try harder; and a revolving door of regulators who left for higher-paying jobs at the companies they once policed. \n \n In June 2009, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia\u2019s handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a \u201cnearly complete breakdown\u201d in the state. \n \n \u201cHistorically, there had been a questionable enforcement ethic,\u201d said Matthew Crum, a former state mining director at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. \n \n Cindy Rank, chairwoman of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy\u2019s mining committee, said that the coal lobby has wielded great influence in crafting state environmental regulations. \u201cAccidents are always preventable. For the most part I think that\u2019s true in these disasters that keep happening,\u201d she said. She recalled negotiations over a groundwater protection bill from the early 1990s. \u201cWe swallowed hard and allowed the coal industry to get away with a lot in that bill,\u201d she said. ||||| Hundreds of thousands of West Virginia residents have gone more than four days without clean tap water after a chemical spill, though officials say that chemical readouts are returning to safe levels. NBC's Anne Thompson reports. \n \n The latest tests of poisoned water in West Virginia have shown that the quality is improving \u201cin the right direction,\u201d the state\u2019s governor said Sunday \u2014 a hopeful sign for the 300,000 residents currently under a strict tap water ban following a chemical spill four days ago. \n \n \"We are at a point where we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said at a news conference. \n \n But officials stopped short of saying when the do-not-use order would be lifted. \n \n \"I can tell you we\u2019re not several days from starting to lift, but I\u2019m not saying today,\" said Jeff McIntyre, president of West Virginia American Water, which runs the water treatment plant. \n \n The chemical spill first noticed Thursday on the Elk River has contaminated the water supply in the heart of the state, shutting down schools and businesses across nine counties, and forcing emergency agencies to truck in clean water to the Charleston region. \n \n Lt. Col. Greg Grant of the West Virginia National Guard said two tests Sunday morning at the treatment facility show the chemical\u2019s concentration at 0 parts-per-million for water going in and out of the plant. \n \n Before the all clear can be given once and for all, water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical\u2019s presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts-per-million, the level recommended by federal agencies. \n \n \"That is a very encouraging and allows us to move forward\" with the next phase of sampling and testing, Grant said. \n \n Sixteen teams were collecting samples from affected areas in the region, and officials cautioned that the ban won\u2019t be lifted until results were in and the state health department signs off. Communities will be given the OK on a zone-by-zone basis. \n \n Marcus Constantino / The Daily Mail via AP Members of the West Virginia Army National Guard, along with a member of the Belle Police Department and a volunteer, offload emergency water from a military truck to a forklift as citizens line up Saturday for water at the Belle Fire Department in Belle, W.Va. \n \n West Virginia American Water is launching an online map to show which communities can begin using their tap water. The company will also autodial customers when the ban in their zone has been lifted. A hotline is also being made available to them. \n \n Schools will also be closed or partially closed in six counties Monday, although officials expect most students to be back in classrooms by Tuesday. \n \n The reliance on bottled water is taking its toll on frustrated residents who\u2019ve stripped stores and spent hours in long lines to collect water from tankers set up by the National Guard. Until the water is deemed safe, residents have been asked not to drink, bathe and cook with the tainted tap. \n \n The environmental emergency began Thursday morning, when the state Department of Environmental Protection began receiving complaints around 8:15 a.m. of a licorice-type odor in the tap water. It took three hours before officials found the source of the spill. \n \n The source turned out to be the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which had leaked out of a 40,000-gallon tank at a Freedom Industries facility along the Elk River. \n \n Freedom Industries didn\u2019t report the leak to a spill hotline until 12:05 p.m. ET Thursday. \n \n State officials said Saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked. Some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river; it\u2019s not clear exactly how much entered the water supply. \n \n All told, 169 people have sought treatment at hospitals for symptoms such as nausea. Of those, 10 were admitted to three different hospitals, but their conditions weren\u2019t serious. \n \n Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, have opened an investigation into Thursday\u2019s spill. \n \n According to the state DEP, Freedom Industries is exempt from DEP inspections and permitting since it stores chemicals, and doesn\u2019t produce them. \n \n But the DEP ordered Freedom Industries to move its coal processing chemicals to a safer site and said it has 24 hours to start writing a plan on how it will clean up the spill and any soil contamination. \n \n The company did not take part in Sunday\u2019s news conference, and Gov. Tomblin said the state hasn\u2019t had much guidance from the company about the chemical in question. \n \n \"Perhaps they could have been a little bit more forthcoming to offer their assistance about what problems this particular chemical could cause,\" Tomblin said. \n \n Tomblin said he will work with his environmental agency chief on tightening regulation of chemical storage facilities in the current legislative session. \n \n Most visitors have cleared out of Charleston while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere. Orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses. \n \n Lisa Hechesky / Reuters Boats sit in the Elk River in front of the Freedom Industries plant in Charleston, W. Va., on Saturday. \n \n In downtown Charleston, the store Taylor Books usually fills the 40 seats in its cafe. But the cafe was shut down by the state Department of Health on Friday because it said employees had no way to safely wash their hands before serving customers. On Saturday only three people sat in the bookstore using the wireless Internet. \n \n Taylor Books' manager Dan Carlisle said he canceled a musician scheduled to play that night and the store was going to close five hours early. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s pretty annoying,\u201d Carlisle said about Freedom Industries\u2019 response to the spill. \u201cI feel like you should just be honest with people immediately.\u201d \n \n In a statement issued Friday, Freedom Industries said that it was working with government agencies to contain the leak, and \u201cthe first priority was safety, containment and cleanup.\u201d \n \n The chemical spill has forced West Virginia's residents to examine the state's reliance on the coal and chemical industries. \n \n Coal is critical to the economy. Strong coal prices and demand proved vital to the state budget during and after the national recession, from 2009 through 2011. \n \n In Gov. Tomblin's recent State-of-the-State speech, he touted the chemical industry, saying it was among those that grew substantially over the last year. \n \n The spill that tainted the water supply involved a chemical used in coal processing. But it didn't involve a coal mine \u2014 and that's a point state officials are trying to convey to the public. \n \n When asked if the emergency is one of the risks of being a state that relies heavily on the coal industry, Tomblin quickly responded: \"This was not a coal company incident, this was a chemical company incident.\" \n \n \"It's used in processing coal, as I understand it, but obviously it was not a coal company, it was a chemical company that left the breach and the tanks that's holding this particular chemical,\" he said. \n \n The coal industry, too, was saying they should not bear the blame in this case. \n \n \"This is a chemical spill accident. It just so happens that the chemical has some applications to the coal industry, just that fact alone shouldn't cause people to point fingers at the coal industry,\" said Jason Bostic, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Stock Chart for Starbucks Corp (SBUX) \n \n Coming soon to a Starbucks near you: Greek yogurt. \n \n In a partnership with Danone SA (BN), the world\u2019s largest coffee shop operator will start selling the dairy product in its cafes next year and in food retailers in 2015. The plan helps address two of Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz\u2019s key concerns: offering healthier fare and helping Starbucks Corp. colonize the grocery store. \n \n \u201cStarbucks is venturing into becoming a house of brands,\u201d similar to Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) and Unilever, Bill Chidley, senior vice president at Interbrand Design Forum in Dayton, Ohio, said in an interview. The move is risky, he said. \n \n \u201cWhen you start to get too diverse with your portfolio, investors just have a hard time characterizing what you are,\u201d Chidley said. \u201cAre they a house of brands or are they about beverage experiences?\u201d \n \n Starbucks has steadily been moving into the grocery business since 1995, when it began selling ice cream in such flavors as java chip frappuccino and caramel macchiato. It has since added packaged coffee, Tazo brand tea and Via instant packets. Since wresting control of Starbucks (SBUX)\u2019 supermarket business from Kraft Foods Inc. in 2011, Schultz has accelerated his rollout of new items into grocery stores with Keurig K-Cup pods, Evolution Fresh juice and Refreshers energy drinks. \n \n Danone, the Paris-based maker of Oikos and Activia brand yogurts, will make the new products for Starbucks, which will be branded \u201cEvolution Fresh, Inspired by Dannon.\u201d The financial terms of the partnership weren\u2019t disclosed. Starbucks bought juicemaker Evolution Fresh in 2011 for $30 million in cash before snapping up Teavana Holdings Inc., whose products it also plans to sell in grocery stores. \n \n Grocery Expansion \n \n Starbucks\u2019s grocery business has been expanding faster than its cafe sales. In the year ended in September, revenue from selling items in supermarkets and other retailers jumped 50 percent to $1.29 billion, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Total revenue that same year increased 14 percent to $13.3 billion. \n \n The shares fell 1.2 percent to $68.19 at 12:02 p.m. in New York. They had gained 29 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 19 percent increase for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. \n \n Starbucks will start selling Greek yogurt parfaits in its company-owned U.S. stores next year. The coffee-shop operator is considering selling the yogurt internationally and may create other foods with Danone, said Jim Olson, a Starbucks spokesman. \n \n Big Step \n \n \u201cThis is really the next big strategic step in our health and wellness evolution,\u201d he said. \n \n Sales of yogurt are increasing -- even more so for the Greek variety. Greek-style yogurt sales in the U.S. surged 48 percent to $2.65 billion in the 52 weeks ended June 8, according to data from Nielsen. Sales of all yogurt increased 6.1 percent to $6.3 billion during the same time, the data show. \n \n Chobani Inc., General Mills Inc. (GIS)\u2019s Yoplait and Fage Dairy Industry SA also sell Greek yogurt. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s certainly crowded,\u201d Interbrand\u2019s Chidley said. \u201cA new entrant is going to have to have something compelling.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net ||||| Starbucks Corp. is making another move to get on more grocery shelves, this time partnering with Danone SA to sell Greek yogurt parfaits and other similar items. \n \n The yogurt products will be co-branded as \"Evolution Fresh, Inspired by Dannon,\" referring to the European company's U.S. line of Dannon yogurt and Starbucks's juice line, Evolution Fresh. The items will first be sold in Starbucks cafes next spring, then in supermarkets in 2015, the companies said Tuesday. Sales overseas are a possibility, eventually. \n \n Starbucks says the yogurt segment in the U.S. is a $6 billion business, with room to grow significantly. U.S. consumers on average eat about half as much yogurt as Canadians consume annually, and a third as much as Europeans, according to Euromonitor. \"With a fast-growing but still low penetration of the yogurt category, the U.S. remains a key growth opportunity for Danone,\" Danone Chief Executive Franck Riboud said in a statement. \n \n Competition will be tough. Chobani Inc.\u2014the leading maker of Greek yogurt, with sales that topped $1 billion last year\u2014recently came out with 14 new items, including flavors like coconut, key lime and orange vanilla. Chobani's founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, has said annual sales of yogurt could double over the next three to four years. The hope is that Americans will start eating yogurt more often during the day\u2014as a dip with a meal, or as a dessert after dinner\u2014rather than just at breakfast. \n \n Starbucks has been working to diversify its traditional coffee business by expanding into more packaged products and food. It acquired Evolution Fresh in November 2011 for $30 million. It also recently purchased a loose-leaf tea retailer, Teavana, for $620 million, and has taken on other new ventures, including a line of energy drinks, a San Francisco Bay-area bakery, and its own single-serve coffee espresso brewer. \n \n In addition to helping Starbucks get a piece of the action in the fast-growing yogurt market, the parfait plan could help build awareness of Evolution Fresh. \n \n Danone's Oikos brand Greek yogurt topped the list of best-selling food products launched in the U.S. last year, according to an annual poll by IRI published in April. Danone says its growth will be accelerated by having access to millions of consumers through Starbucks's cafes. \n \n Starbucks didn't disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said Danone will handle the distribution, so it doesn't expect to face additional capital expenses. The coffee giant is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings Thursday. \n \n Corrections & Amplifications \n \n Starbucks bought Evolution Fresh in November 2011. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the acquisition was last November.",

Kavanaugh. \n \n At the time, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) rejected accusations that a member of her staff was responsible, calling them \u201clies, lies, and more despicable lies.\u201d \n \n The information posted purportedly included phone numbers and home addresses for three Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the hearing: Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah). \n \n [\u2018Despicable lies\u2019: Rep.

The information was quickly removed after the doxing was discovered and aides contacted authorities. \n \n Edits to the online encyclopedia were traced to IP addresses of computer devices assigned to the U.S. Capitol. Waters in her statement last week said Capitol Police and internal computer specialists determined that an IP address cited online did not belong to her office or anyone on her staff. \n \n According to the Legistorm website of congressional disclosures, Cosko was employed as a low-level aide from January 2017 to May 2018 with the office of U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and earlier with former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). \n \n Hassan spokesman Aaron Jacobs said he could not comment on an ongoing investigation. \n \n Cosko was paid $23,000 over six months ending March 31, according to Legistorm. \n \n A LinkedIn website to a Jackson Cosko lists work from Jan. 2016 to May 2018 as an intern, press assistant and legislative correspondent/systems administrator assisting senior Senate staff on matters before the commerce and homeland security committees, including cyber security issues. \n \n It could not be immediately determined if Cosko had any past connection to Waters\u2019 office. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday. ||||| Personal information of Republican Sens.

The information has since been removed. \n \n All three targeted senators were members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who questioned both Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh regarding Ford\u2019s allegations that he sexually assaulted her over 36 years ago. The leaking of information occurred sometime after the three lawmakers questioned Kavanaugh. \n \n KAVANAUGH VOTE LIVE BLOG - SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WEIGHS IN ON RECOMMENDING NOMINEE \n \n But while the home addresses of the senators appear to be correct, the phone numbers weren\u2019t entirely accurate, with most either disconnected or going to voicemail. \n \n A \u201chome\u201d phone number listed for Graham appears to direct the callers to Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League (SMYAL), a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group.

Jasper Colt, USA TODAY \n \n The Solar Impulse 2, a sun-powered airplane, circles the Kalaeloa Airport, on July 3, 2015, in Kapolei, Hawaii. (Photo: Marco Garcia, AP) \n \n The record-setting flight of the sun-powered Solar Impulse 2 landed in Hawaii on Friday after the longest, most dangerous leg of its around-the-world journey. \n \n The plane landed around noon ET at Hawaii's Kalaeloa Airport after an arduous five-day, non-stop flight, according to Solar Impulse's website, which live streamed the event. \n \n The completed 4,000-mile leg from Nagoya, Japan, to Hawaii was not only the world's longest solar-powered flight both by time and distance, it also set the record for longest solo flight by time. \n \n \"Just landed in #Hawaii with @solarimpulse! For @bertrandpiccard and I, it's a dream coming true,\" pilot Andr\u00e9 Borschberg upon his successful landing. \n \n Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard have been alternating the long solo flights aboard the plane. The flight from Japan to Hawaii was the eighth of 13 legs. \n \n Borschberg had been stuck in the cramped cockpit of the plane since taking off early Monday in Japan. He was unable to stand and his only rest was the occasional 20-minute nap. \n \n The Solar Impulse 2 approaches Hawaii with Andre Borschberg at the controls, near Kalaeloa Airport, O'ahu, Hawaii, on July 3, 2015. (Photo: Solar Impulse) \n \n \n \n \"It is delicate to maintain a balance between my energy and the energy of the aircraft,\" pilot Andr\u00e9 Borschberg tweeted early Friday. His only rest the past five days has been occasional 20-minute naps. As the flight neared its destination, the Solar Impulse team tweeted images and videos of the plane over Hawaii. Earlier Friday, founder of Virgin Group Richard Branson congratulated the Solar Impulse team on Twitter for beating Virgin's record non-stop solo flight without refueling. In a tweet Thursday, Borschberg reported on the challenges of the flight. \"I'm fighting, it's difficult. ... Managing energy level is not easy. I have to find a hole in the cold front.\" Unlike the first several legs of the flight, which were over land in Asia, this leg was more dangerous because there would be no place to land if something went wrong above the vast Pacific Ocean. Bad weather delayed the trip to Hawaii for weeks. The plane must find clear skies during the day to receive as much solar energy as possible. At night, running on batteries fueled during the day, the plane descends to a lower altitude and slows speed to conserve energy. Part of the plane's mission is to raise awareness about climate change, showcasing what can be done using nothing but renewable energy. \"The most important thing isn't to make world records,\" Piccard told USA TODAY in an interview last month. \"It's to show what we can do with clean technologies,\" he said, ones that could simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and stimulate economic growth. \"We will never improve the situation if we continue to speak of climate change as a big and expensive problem, or by asking people to reduce their lifestyle to protect nature,\" he said. The mission began March 9 with a flight from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to Muscat, Oman. Pilots Borschberg and Piccard have alternated the legs of the journey. The plane's mission control is in Monaco, where a team of meteorologists, flight engineers and other experts closely track and monitor the weather and flight conditions. From Hawaii, the plane will continue the ocean crossing to Phoenix as weather permits. From there, Solar Impulse will land at a location in the Midwest, then in New York City. It will undertake two final flights over the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea before landing back at Abu Dhabi.

It also was the longest flight in time and distance (more than 8,200 kilometers, or 5,100 miles) for a plane run only on solar power, organizers said. \n \n After landing at Oahu's Kalaeloa Airport, Borschberg opened the cockpit door and waved to a cheering crowd. \n \n Borschberg, having been off his feet for five straight days, didn't attempt to stand until another 50 minutes passed. Someone climbed up to the cabin to give him a leg massage before he finally stepped onto a platform. \n \n Read More",

The feat is just one leg on a planned around-the-world trip, but the non-stop stretch over the Pacific was seen as the most difficult, and dangerous, part of the flight. It set the record for the longest solar-powered flight in terms of both time and distance. Waiting to greet Borschberg at the Kalaeloa Airport were his family and his co-pilot, Bertrand Piccard, who will now fly the plane on its next leg, a 100-hour trip to Phoenix. The 62-year-old Borschberg had to make do with 20-minute naps in the cramped cockpit over his five-day trip, and at times, he sweated through 100-degree temperatures, reports the Guardian.

    "document": "GREENSBURG, Ind. -- A mom who has been behind bars since 1996 accused of murdering her toddler son in an arson fire, walked free from jail Wednesday after new evidence was presented that led a court to grant her a new trial. \n \n A sheriff led Kristine Bunch, wearing a new dress and black patent leather shoes and carrying her prison clothes in a Wal-Mart bag, out the door of the jail. He let go of her arm and then said quietly: \"You're free.\" \n \n Bunch, 38, turned down the sidewalk and went straight to her mother, Susan Hubbard. They had a long embrace. \n \n Next in line for Bunch was her son, 16-year-old Trenton, who had never visited his mother outside of prison, who has never slept under the same roof with her except for his very first night. Bunch went back to the Indiana Women's Prison the day after giving birth at a local hospital. \n \n Authorities say Bunch set fire to her mobile home in a blaze that killed her 3-year-old son, Tony. \n \n Bunch, then 22, was sentenced to 60 years. But on Wednesday, at 38, she was released, pending a new trial that was granted in March by the Indiana Court of Appeals. \n \n The Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law took up Bunch's case in 2007 and was joined in the cause by Chicago attorney Ron Safer, whose Schiff Hardin firm worked on the case at no cost. In 2009, they presented new evidence to the appeals court based, in part, on technological advances in fire investigations. \n \n The new evidence, Safer said, made it impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged, that some test results the state provided were simply incorrect. In actuality, tests showed that he died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Safer said. Had the fire been set with an accelerant in the manner prosecutors alleged, he would have died from burns. \n \n On Wednesday, Senior Circuit Judge W. Michael Wilke, based on the fact that Bunch's family put up bond money for her in 1996, said the words she and her family had waited 16 years to hear: \"The defendant will be released from the Department of Corrections.\" \n \n Decatur County prosecutors were unavailable for comment. Bunch has a court appearance next week. But, Safer said, \"Today she is a free woman, and we are determined to make sure that she has spent her last day behind bars.\" \n \n Bunch said she was initially in a state of shock upon being sentenced to 60 years for arson and the murder of her son. She likened it to a bad dream that wouldn't end. Upon her release, Bunch was joyful but expressed no bitterness over a conviction she has always maintained was a mistake. \n \n \"I haven't been by myself,\" she said. \"I had a family that stood by me. I had people that believed in me and stepped up. And you can't receive blessings like that and be bitter.\" \n \n While in prison, Bunch said she took part in Kairos prison ministry and became a Catholic. She earned undergraduate degrees in English and anthropology from Ball State University. And now she has dreams of going to law school, focusing on criminal law and joining a wrongful conviction team. \n \n \"I want to give back. I've been very blessed,\" she said. \"One day I want to fight for others because others fought for me.\" \n \n First, Bunch said she wants to get reacquainted with her family. \n \n Trenton already has a long list of things he wants to do with his mom. \n \n He wants to take a trip to the zoo, go to a concert, have her watch him run track in the spring if he makes the team. \n \n \"I want to do the stuff that I should have been able to do a long time ago,\" he said, \"and never got to do.\" \n \n Initially, though, Trenton may have to help his mother navigate her 16-year time warp. When she was last free, cellphones were the size of shoeboxes, and she was amazed at the tiny devices her friends and her legal team were toting, that half the courtroom had to cough up at the judge's order before her hearing began. \n \n And then there's the Internet -- she's heard about it but never seen it. There's no access in the prison. \n \n \"My son said I'm going to teach you how to Facebook,\" she said, \"and we're going to look at the Internet.\" \n \n But Bunch also relishes the idea of much simpler pleasures. She wants to watch her son sleep. \n \n \"I've never gotten to see my son sleep except for little naps when he would come visit me,\" she said. \"I want to be able to bounce in his room all night and look at him while he's asleep.\" ||||| Women's Project \n \n Featured article by Emily Halter, CWC alum and Northwestern Pritzker School of Law 2018 graduate \n \n \"While some programs exist in the United States, for the most part, there are few avenues of support for incarcerated mothers.

In many cases, they are suspected of harming their children or other loved ones. As a result, when under investigation, they may be coping with deep personal loss, rendering them especially vulnerable to high-pressure interrogation tactics that can lead to false confessions or seemingly inculpatory statements. When women\u2014traditionally viewed as nurturers and protectors\u2014are accused of murdering or sexually abusing children, they are particularly reviled by society, including, of course, police, prosecutors, judges, jurors, and witnesses. 40% of female exonerees were convicted harming children or loved ones in their care. \n \n In cases in which no crime has occurred\u2014such as accidental or natural deaths that are mistaken for homicides\u2014the evidence is often entirely circumstantial. DNA evidence, the gold standard for exonerating the innocent, has been central to less than 3% of women's exonerations (compared to 22% of men's exonerations). In circumstantial cases, other types of forensic evidence may play an unusually large role, yet the evidence may be erroneous. More than a third of exonerated women's cases involved flawed or misleading forensic evidence. Two-thirds of female exonerees were convicted in cases in which no crime occurred. \n \n *Statistics on this webpage are derived from the National Registry of Exonerations and are reasonably current but may not be fully up to date. ||||| Center on Wrongful Convictions \n \n CWC client Tommy Ward featured in The Innocent Man, premiering on Netflix December 14, 2018 \n \n The Innocent Man Netflix series includes the story of the Center on Wrongful Convictions\u2019 client Tommy Ward.

It fanned out across the floor and climbed up the walls, then formed an impassable barrier across the middle of the trailer. Bunch, 21, snapped awake in the living room. Her three-year-old son, Tony, shrieked for her on the other side of the flames. \n \n Bunch staggered outside and howled for a neighbor. She bashed Tony's window with a tricycle. As the flames lashed 30 feet into the dawn sky, a fire engine tore up to the house. A firefighter, crawling on his belly, found Tony's charred body in the bedroom. \n \n Bunch told police she had no idea what caused the fire. Soon, though, arson investigators determined that a liquid accelerant such as kerosene or lighter fluid had been poured in Tony's bedroom and the living room. Police arrested Bunch on charges of arson and felony murder. Eight months later, Bunch went on trial. By then, she was 22 and unexpectedly pregnant with a second child. The evidence against her seemed overwhelming. Two arson investigators gave compelling testimony for the prosecution, and the jury took only a few hours to convict her on both counts. \n \n At sentencing, Bunch recalled, the judge sneered down at her belly. \n \n \"I understand that you have arranged to have yourself impregnated,\" he said. \"You thought it would work to your advantage somehow in this process. It will not. You will not raise that child.\" \n \n The judge gave her the maximum sentence: 60 years. \n \n \n \n Karen Daniel and Judy Royal are obsessed with people like Bunch. \n \n During their nearly 30 combined years at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Law School, the two lawyers have helped exonerate more than two dozen people once found guilty of horrendous crimes. Most of the people they have freed are men; just four are women. And for a long time, Daniel and Royal thought that disparity made perfect sense. Men are convicted of crimes, especially violent crimes, at much higher rates than are women. So it follows that most people exonerated of crimes are also men: The National Registry of Exonerations, a University of Michigan Law School database that has cataloged information on more than 1,600 exonerations nationwide since 1989, includes just 148 women. \n \n About three years ago, however, Daniel and Royal began to question whether that number was too low. Women make up about 11 percent of the people convicted of violent crimes, but just 6 percent of those exonerated of violent crimes. At the urging of a former client, Julie Rea Harper\u2014who spent four years in prison for the murder of her son before a serial killer confessed to the crime\u2014Daniel and Royal decided to try to figure out if there was anything that set exonerated women apart. \n \n They started by looking at the few women whose cases they had worked on themselves. \"I haven't had any men's cases that looked like these four cases,\" Daniel recalls thinking. \"Could that really be a coincidence?\" \n \n After three years of pursuing that question, Daniel and Royal have concluded that most innocence projects\u2014including their own legal clinic\u2014are failing to bring justice to wrongly convicted women. They have identified factors that make female clients more difficult to exonerate, and uncovered startling facts that distinguish the cases of wrongly convicted women from those of men. And they have launched a project that could change how the American innocence movement helps these women get justice. \n \n \n \n Daniel and Royal started by digging deep into the exonerations database. Their first insight had to do with DNA evidence\u2014the very breakthrough that launched the innocence movement a quarter century ago. \"Women tend not to be convicted of the types of crimes that can be overturned based on the results of DNA testing,\" Daniel explained. Men perpetrate the overwhelming majority of rapes and murders of strangers. These crimes are much more likely to leave behind DNA evidence that can rule out an innocent suspect, or point to the real rapist or killer. \n \n But when women kill, they usually kill someone close to them. And in most of those cases, DNA isn't relevant. When a woman is suspected of killing her husband or her child, investigators are likely to find her DNA all over the crime scene whether she's guilty or innocent\u2014so DNA testing can do little to exonerate her. Sure enough, 27 percent of the men in the exonerations registry were freed using DNA evidence. The same was true of only 7.6 percent of the women. \n \n Yet many exoneration projects, including the original Innocence Project founded in 1992, only work with convicts who can be absolved through DNA. Because courts consider DNA tests definitive and trustworthy, genetic evidence is often the most effective way to overturn a wrongful conviction. Innocence projects have tended to avoid cases in which the offender knew the victim, because it can be hard to disentangle what happened in a domestic crime. In some cases, Daniel said, \"you almost have to look into that person's brain to know what happened.\" About half the women in the registry went to prison for harming someone in their care. \n \n But reliance on DNA and aversion to domestic cases weren't the only hurdles for wrongly convicted women. In a whopping 63 percent of the women's cases, Daniel and Royal realized, it turned out that there was never a crime to begin with\u2014the death was actually a suicide or an accident. That was true in only 21 percent of the men's cases. \n \n This was a critical discovery. The tools innocence projects rely on are designed to solve crimes. When DNA evidence isn't available, innocence investigators may seek to establish alibis, interview witnesses overlooked by police, undermine mistaken witness identifications, or track down alternative suspects with a history of similar crimes. Attorneys have a much easier time getting a wrongful conviction reopened when they can point to the real culprit. \n \n Yet if a woman is wrongly convicted for an accident that kills her child, there is no crime to solve, no \"real killer,\" and probably no alibi. \n \n Overturning convictions for crimes that were really accidents is difficult and time-consuming. Attorneys may have to prove that the prosecution misused or misunderstood forensic science or withheld crucial evidence. Proving that something was an accident may require attorneys to understand highly technical and controversial evidence on fire science, shaken-baby syndrome, toxicology, or rare medical conditions, and hire expensive expert witnesses to bolster their arguments. These hurdles disproportionately affect women: Daniel and Royal have found that 37 percent of the women (but around 20 percent of the men) in the exonerations registry were cleared because their original convictions used false or misleading forensic evidence. \n \n There was one more thing that set exonerated women apart: Daniel and Royal have come to believe that, in many cases in which women were freed because no crime had been committed, sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive. \n \n \"Almost every case has something like this,\" Daniel told me, recounting one trial in which a prosecutor suggested a mother had killed her son so she could pursue a career in modeling. \"That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,\" Daniel said. The woman spent years in prison before the real perpetrator came forward. \n \n When Harper, the woman blamed after a serial killer murdered her son, was on trial, the prosecution portrayed her variously as thirsty for revenge on her ex-husband or, pointing out her pursuit of a postgraduate degree, career-obsessed with no time for a child. Her ex-husband testified that Harper considered an abortion when she first became pregnant (which Harper denied). \"And that was used to show she was capable of murder,\" Royal said, noting that the trial\u2014and jury selection\u2014took place in a rural, heavily conservative county in Illinois. \n \n In the case of Kristine Bunch, the prosecutor said he didn't think the blaze burned Bunch badly enough. Wouldn't a mother walk through fire to save her child? He offered evidence that Bunch was a bad mother, telling the jury in his closing argument that she had asked a friend to take custody of Tony, even though the friend had denied this rumor in her testimony. Not to mention the judge's comments about Bunch's pregnancy. \n \n These sorts of narratives have \"nothing to do with whether the evidence shows that a person did what they're being accused of,\" said Andrea Louise Lewis, an attorney who works for Royal and Daniel. \"And these women get wrongfully convicted in these cases where nothing happened. Nothing criminal happened at all.\" \n \n \n \n After Kristine Bunch gave birth to her second son, correctional officers put her in an ankle chain just long enough for her to reach the toilet in her hospital room. It had been three months since she went to prison. Bunch held her baby for a fleeting moment before her parents took him home with them. Then she made it her single-minded mission to find someone to help reopen her case. \n \n \"I realized, I'm going to have to fight,\" Bunch recalled. She sent out hundreds of letters and received hundreds of rejections. \n \n Daniel and Royal have come to believe that in many cases sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive. \n \n While Bunch despaired in prison, new research emerged showing that the signatures of an accidental fire are easy to confuse with signs of arson; as a result, many old arson cases have been called into question. In a similar vein, child abuse investigators once took it as gospel that a baby with brain swelling and certain forms of internal bleeding had been violently shaken within the past several hours. But a new body of evidence suggests that infections, infant strokes, and accidental falls can also cause the telltale symptoms of shaken-baby syndrome (SBS). Meanwhile, child abuse researchers now believe that a symptom like brain bleeding can take days\u2014not hours\u2014to cause serious problems. If a child has several caregivers\u2014a babysitter, relatives, and immediate family members\u2014it can be impossible to say with certainty who abused her. \n \n But it's prosecutors who decide whether to file charges or fight appeals, and not all of them buy the new science. When I sent questions about wrongly convicted women to the National District Attorneys Association, I was referred to Josh Marquis, an NDAA board member and Oregon district attorney who is a strident skeptic of the innocence community. Daniel and Royal noted that a disproportionate number of women are exonerated because new science cast doubt on their original conviction\u2014or even moved medical experts who once testified against them to change their minds. But Marquis said that he and many of his fellow prosecutors don't trust the developing science. New doubts about SBS, he said, are shared by only \"a very small group of doctors\" whose voices have been amplified by the defense bar. As for developments in arson science, he said, \"arson investigation is more of an art than a science.\" \n \n It was only when Bunch connected with an Indianapolis attorney named Hilary Bowe Ricks, and scraped together a modest fee using her $1.30-a-day prison earnings, that she learned that new arson science could cast her conviction into doubt. In 2006, Ricks convinced the Northwestern center to join the case, and the team, which by then included Daniel, soon found a bevy of problems with the conviction. Bunch's original defense attorney had argued that one of the trailer home's many electrical problems probably caused the fire. Any accelerant, he insisted, was likely from a kerosene heater the family sometimes ran in the living room. However, state investigators working on-site (using now-questionable science) observed burn patterns in Tony's bedroom that fire experts at the time saw as undisputed evidence of arson. And a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives chemist who examined 10 samples sent to his Washington, DC, lab testified at Bunch's original trial that the floor of both the living room and the bedroom tested positive for liquid accelerant. \n \n Bunch's new legal team obtained the raw data that the ATF chemist had analyzed. According to lawsuits her attorneys have since filed against the investigators for withholding evidence, someone had altered the result for the sample in Tony's bedroom, which was negative for accelerant, making Bunch seem guilty. It appeared to Ricks as though investigators hadn't found accelerant anywhere in the trailer home, except in the living room, where the heater stood. \n \n The fire that had taken Tony's life now looked like an accident. (The state investigators have denied any wrongdoing, and an ATF spokeswoman declined to comment.) \n \n Bunch's legal team brought this undisclosed evidence to the Indiana Court of Appeals. On March 21, 2012, a three-judge panel reversed Bunch's conviction. The state Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in August, and she walked out of prison, a free woman for the first time in more than 16 years. By Christmas, prosecutors quietly declined to retry her. \n \n \"When you walk out, you're exonerated, and you're free and clear. But that hurt, that humiliation, that shame\u2014it doesn't go away.\" \n \n \n \n A few months after Bunch was released, Daniel and Royal launched Northwestern's Women's Project, an exoneration effort focused exclusively on freeing wrongly convicted women. They have already agreed to represent six women\u2014cases that will involve child head trauma and arson science\u2014and in December, they asked the Illinois Supreme Court to grant their first appeal. Meanwhile, their team is poring over files from dozens of suspicious convictions around the country and amassing court transcripts for an in-depth study of wrongful convictions of women accused of killing their children. \n \n Daniel and Royal's tiny project may wind up in the vanguard of work to exonerate both men and women. More wrongful convictions are overturned each year, but fewer and fewer of them involve DNA: Paul Cates, a spokesman for the Innocence Project, told me that investigators have now cleared many \"easy\" DNA cases\u2014such as convictions that can be overturned by testing a single previously untested rape kit. Instead, more cases now involve complex DNA evidence, or none at all, and many more of those cases are ultimately found to involve an accident. Last year, a record 125 people were exonerated across the country; in 58 of those cases, courts found no crime was committed at all. \n \n Today, Kristine Bunch volunteers for the Women's Project, sorting through inmates' letters. She reads each one carefully, remembering the decade she spent writing pleas just like theirs. \"You live with this freaky numbness,\" she said. \"It's almost like you're underwater and everything is in slow motion. And you can't seem to pull yourself up out of it.\" \n \n She is thrilled that there is now an outfit giving convictions like hers its full attention, run by attorneys who understand that everything about a woman\u2014her career, her ambitions, how much she cries\u2014is ripe for judgment. In her off-hours, she is trying to get to know her 19-year-old son. Even though she saw him nearly every weekend in prison, she missed out on raising him, and building a strong relationship has proved difficult. \n \n So has the healing process. Many men who were wrongfully convicted didn't know their supposed victims. But with Bunch, the accident she was blamed for not only took 17 years of her life\u2014it took her child. \n \n \"You're accused of this horrible, horrible crime, you're put away, you have newspapers saying horrible, horrible things about you,\" she said. \"When you walk out, you're exonerated, and you're free and clear. But that hurt, that humiliation, that shame\u2014it doesn't go away because you've been exonerated. It's hard to step back out and act like you're normal and part of the world.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Exonerating women who are wrongfully convicted of violent crimes is no easy task\u2014just ask Kristine Bunch. She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a \"real culprit,\" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. \"That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,\" says Daniel. \"Almost every case has something like this.\" Click for Mother Jones' full article.",

It has been described by inventor Musk as a mix between Concorde, a rail gun, and an air hockey table that could take you from Los Angeles to San Francisco in under 30 minutes. \n \n Hyperloop Technologies said that magnetic fields in the tunnel will lift the pod before a \"thrust force\" is applied, accelerating the pod to speeds just shy of the speed of sound (767 mph). \n \n The same thrust force is simply reversed to decelerate the pod. As the pod slows down, the system's battery is recharged through what Hyperloop describes as regenerative breaking. \n \n \"Utilising a passive levitation system will eliminate the need for power stations along the Hyperloop track, which makes this system the most suitable for the application and will keep construction costs low,\" said Bibop Gresta, COO of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, in a statement. \"From a safety aspect, the system has huge advantages, levitation occurs purely through movement, therefore if any type of power failure occurs, Hyperloop pods would continue to levitate and only after reaching minimal speeds touch the ground.\" \n \n Critics have questioned whether Hyperloop will ever come to fruition, targeting cost and safety as potential major setbacks. ||||| Elon Musk's Hyperloop Dream Has Its 1st Public Demo \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Hyperloop One Hyperloop One \n \n Updated at 3 p.m. ET. \n \n Out in the Nevada desert today, the world got a good look at the first public test of the Hyperloop \u2014 a concept that could someday become a new mode of transportation. \n \n Don't call it a Wright Brothers' \"Kitty Hawk\" moment just yet, though. The demo focused on only one piece of a very complicated system. \n \n The Hyperloop, envisioned by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, would move passenger-filled pods through special tubes at incredibly high speeds \u2014 as in possibly crossing the 400 miles between San Francisco and Los Angeles in a mere 30 minutes. Musk offered up his ideas in 2013, and others got to work trying to build it. \n \n One of the startups that jumped at the challenge is Hyperloop One, formerly Hyperloop Technologies, tested its propulsion mechanism today. Take a look, via CNBC: \n \n The Wall Street Journal wrote earlier in the day: \n \n \"The focus of the test will be more on the propulsion technology \u2014 whether it can actually move the sled \u2014 than the speed. The track is shorter and there will be air resistance, two slowing factors which will be eliminated in future tests.\" \n \n On Tuesday, Hyperloop One announced new funding and new partners in transportation and engineering. One of those partners is Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. Gizmodo says that Ingels, known for big public infrastructure projects, \"will give some much-needed design direction for how Hyperloop One's projects might start to integrate with the cities they're meant to serve.\" Gizmodo also has this statement from the architect: \n \n \"With hyperloop we are not only designing a futuristic station or a very fast train, we are dealing with an entirely novel technology with the potential to completely transform how our existing cities will grow and evolve, and how new cities will be conceived and constructed.\" \n \n Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd said in a statement that the company would work with these new partners \"to redefine the future of transportation, providing a more immediate, safe, efficient and sustainable high-speed backbone for the movement of people and things.\" \n \n toggle caption Joshua Caldwell of Cryptic Butterfly Photography/Hyperloop One \n \n So will any of this actually work? NPR's Elise Hu asked the question when Musk announced his idea almost three years ago. Electrical engineer Marc Thompson told her it seemed that it would. But that's not the end of the story, said the Worcester Polytechnic professor: \"The devil's in the details in terms of testing, safety, passenger safety, egress, vibration, all that engineering stuff.\" \n \n Former U.S. Department of Transportation Assistant Secretary Emil Frankel also had reservations, which he shared with Elise at the time. \n \n \"To talk about these kinds of leapfrogging technology in a context when we can't really adequately maintain our existing infrastructure is really not terribly realistic. At least not in terms of the public policy debate,\" Frankel said. \n \n Hyperloop One and competitor Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, or HTT, don't seem deterred. HTT is making progress, too, Wired notes: \n \n \"We think we will be able to demonstrate full Kitty Hawk capabilities by the end of this year.\" ||||| CLOSE Competing teams will be showing off their Hyperloop prototypes in a bid to see who can build the best, most viable system. USA TODAY \n \n Elon Musk's SpaceX was the first to propose the notion of transporting people and cargo at speeds of 700 mph, a tech dubbed hyperloop. (Photo: SpaceX) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The hyperloop wars are on. \n \n On Monday, a crowdsourced enterprise led by NASA and Boeing veterans called Hyperloop Transportation Technologies announced it had licensed passive magnetic levitation technology to power its prototype system, which like other hyperloop templates, promises to shuttle humans and goods in a vacuum tube system at speeds up to 750 mph. \n \n How fast is that? Zipping from Los Angeles to San Francisco would take 30 minutes as compared to a six-hour drive or an all-day train ride. \n \n Hyperloop Technologies, one of a number of outfits pursuing hyperloop tech, plans to show off its prototype in the desert north of Las Vegas this week. (Photo: Hyperloop Technologies) \n \n The announcement comes just two days before rival Hyperloop Technologies Inc. plans to showcase the evolution of its technology to investors and media in the desert north of Las Vegas. On its website, Hyperloop Technologies features photos and videos showing off large tubes that would house long pods for either people or cargo. Both HTI and HTT are based in Los Angeles. \n \n Another player in the space is skyTran, located at NASA Research Park just south of San Francisco. The company recently unveiled a technology demonstration system showcasing how its two- and four-person vehicles will work, and are aiming to build a 30-mile track in Lagos, Nigeria. skyTran has raised $30 million and is operating in partnership with NASA. \n \n Hyperloop technology offers the possibility of moving people and things at great speeds without using fossil fuels. The pitfalls include making such transportation reliable while mitigating for potential catastrophes unfolding at around the speed of sound. \n \n And hyperloop remains more Buck Rogers than your next shuttle to work. \n \n The foundations of its tech are familiar: the maglev, or magnetic levitation, principle that allows a vehicle to achieve great speeds by riding on air is already at work on high-speed trains in Europe and Japan. But hyperloop would face the same infrastructure and regulatory hurdles that vex high-speed rail projects and autonomous cars. \n \n And that's not to mention the price tag. A tube system linking L.A. and San Francisco with hyperloop pods has been estimated to cost north of $6 billion. \n \n It's ON! We're 1 day away from some big announcements. Live-tweeting starts tomorrow @ 5PM PDT https://t.co/tASsQqwMyy#hyperloop \u2014 HyperloopTech (@HyperloopTech) May 9, 2016 \n \n In its Monday statement, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies says its design will tackle the safety concerns with a passive levitation system, which will eliminate the need for power stations along the Hyperloop track and keep construction costs low. \n \n \"From a safety aspect, the system has huge advantages, levitation occurs purely through movement, therefore if any type of power failure occurs, Hyperloop pods would continue to levitate and only after reaching minimal speeds touch the ground,\" said Bibop Gresta, chief operating officer of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, said. \n \n Also in the hyperloop race is SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who first popularized the idea of shuttling people and cargo in tubes in 2013. \n \n In January, a team from MIT won an inaugural hyperloop competition sponsored by SpaceX. Similar to HTT's approach, the MIT team proposed placing magnets on the pods that react to passive coils in the tubes, thereby generating lift or levitation. \n \n Hyperloop Transportation Technologies has announced that is licensing tech that would allow high-speed transportation at lower than anticipated costs when compared to existing magnetic transportation tech. (Photo: Hyperloop Transportation Technologies) \n \n \u201cThe beauty of the system we designed is that it\u2019s completely passive, an elegant property that will make our pod very scalable,\" team captain Philippe Kirschen, a master\u2019s student in aeronautics and astronautics, told MIT News when the team won. \n \n Musk has tweeted that SpaceX may build a test track for its emerging hyperloop tech, \"most likely in Texas.\" \n \n While SpaceX is backed by Musk's drive and billions and skyTran has government support, the other two entrants in the hyperloop sweepstakes \u2014HTT and HTI \u2014 have taken radically different approaches to financing their efforts. \n \n Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) is powered by financial donations and the know-how of space tech veterans donating their time to the project. In contrast, Hyperloop Technologies Inc. (HTI) has raised $37 million to date, and is co-founded by early Uber investor Shervin Pishevar and former SpaceX engineer Brogan BamBrogan. \n \n HTT's passive magnetic levitation approach is based on science developed by the late physicist Richard Post of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, east of San Francisco. \n \n By placing magnets on the hyperloop transportation pods and having them react - and cause lift - with coils in the transportation pods, one can avoid the costly approach currently used by maglev trains, which require pricey tracks laced with copper coils. \n \n In 2015, HTT said it would be installing its hyperloop tech in a proposed 75,000-resident solar-powered city in Quay Valley, Calif., halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. In February, HTT CEO Dirk Ahlborn announced that it was in talks with the Slovakian government about possibly building a hyperloop route in the former Eastern Bloc nation. \n \n Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter: @marcodellacava \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1T7rZcp ||||| One small push for Hyperloop, one giant thrust for the future of transportation. \n \n In the arid northern deserts of Nevada, far from the bright lights and towering edifices of Las Vegas, the Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One took a gamble and won, successfully testing its linear induction propulsion system. \n \n A grandstand full of journalists and Hyperloop One supporters watched as a series of stators (basically electromagnetic blades) quickly powered up under the sled, which then flew by at about the speed of a fast car (115 mph or so). \n \n Image: Hyperloop One/Mashable \n \n The test, while fast, was, to be honest, somewhat underwhelming. After the initial countdown, the sled took off from the start position and whizzed by on a track at a measured 2.4 Gs of acceleration. Special grabbers underneath the sled then slammed into a sandpit, which effectively slowed the sled down to zero and ended the test. \n \n Future tests on this track at the 39.9 acre facility will go much, much faster. \n \n The Hyperloop One speed-by.

Image: Lance Ulanoff/Mashable \n \n Originally the brainchild of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, Hyperloop transportation consists of sealed pods traveling at subsonic speeds in a low-pressure tube that's elevated above the ground on pylons. It's intended to be a low-energy (solar) and low-emission system. It could also be a viable mass transportation alternative for traffic-snarled corridors like those between New York and Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles and San Francisco, completing the latter trip in as little as 35 minutes. \n \n Musk produced a lengthy Hyperloop white paper and then open-sourced the concept in 2014. As a result, the Hyperloop race is on, and, with Wednesday's test, Hyperloop One may have just inched ahead of rival HTT. \n \n The Hyperloop One propulsion system test sled. Image: lance ulanoff/mashable \n \n Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd seemed elated by the short test's results and predicts that, with enough cooperation from local and state government bodies (the kind they've found in Nevada and Las Vegas), Hyperloop One will be moving cargo by 2019 and people as early as 2021. \n \n As for what Hyperloop One has in store for the short-term, BamBrogan said, \"a lot more of this testing.\" \n \n Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments. ||||| A few days ago, an executive with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies \u2014 one of two major companies seeking to turn Hyperloop from science fiction to reality \u2014 said the major expense incurred during construction would be \u201cthe tube.\u201d This is absolutely right if he\u2019s thinking about building Hyperloop just as a proof of concept. If he wants to build something functional, that people use, he should prepare to spend the bulk of his company\u2019s cash on carpeting. The problem with Elon Musk\u2019s hyperfast hypertransport \u2014 the one people aren\u2019t already talking about \u2014 is that riders are going to vomit everywhere. \n \n That\u2019s hyperbolic of course, but the fact remains that the way Hyperloop is being pitched to the public right now \u2014 a 750 mile-per-hour pneumatically-run speed tube designed to get Tesla owners from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 35 minutes \u2014 doesn\u2019t touch on human physiology and creature comfort. When people are commuting to and from work, trekking across town to take care of errands, or traveling long distances, they want to do so without feeling profoundly uncomfortable. Speed is great, but there\u2019s a reason people will forgo a crowded subway for ungodly traffic if it means they can at least enjoy some space in their car. \n \n In a vacuum, humans can handle a constant speed, whether it\u2019s at a snail\u2019s pace or a bullet\u2019s screech. But a real Hyperloop won\u2019t just travel several hundred miles and then reverse course in the opposite direction. There will be stops, a lot of them if this kind of technology emerges as the successor to our aging railroad system. That means pods will be speeding up and slowing down more frequently than most of us would want. And the United States is not flat \u2014 it\u2019s got a pretty gnarly terrain in some places. Hyperloop will be forced to go around these things, and above them in some instances. \n \n Currently, high-speed trains (all the rage in Asian countries like China and Japan) top off at around 200 miles per hour or so. Moving at this high rate of speed consistently produces few physical symptoms, but acceleration, deceleration, and turns get problematic after a certain point. The human body can only handle about 0.2 Gs of acceleration vertically or laterally. Hyperloop would involve accelerations that would potentially push way past this limit (up to seven times greater than the limits imposed on Japan\u2019s Shinkansen bullet train). \n \n When you move, G-forces act on your body, in both positive ways (e.g. pushing you back to your seat) and negative ways (e.g. pulling you forward into your seatbelt). When you throw in the ability to move in three different planes, you\u2019re contending with G-forces in three different directions. Your gastrointestinal tract can lurch in a different direction than your spinal column. That\u2019s when nausea sets in \u2014 and if the ride doesn\u2019t end soon or if you don\u2019t find a way to adjust, prepare to say hello again to your latest meal. \n \n The solution, naturally, is to go slower. The Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by Elon Musk and SpaceX requires teams to construct pods that go at least 240 miles per hour. Naturally, teams like MIT are building prototypes capable of moving considerably faster. As Hyperloop moves forward, however, the 240 mph range might actually be standard outside of the Great Plains. If too fast is too uncomfortable, the Hyperloop will slow down. \n \n It\u2019s important to emphasize that human physiology is relative \u2014 what causes one person to wretch is someone else\u2019s cup of tea. Some people can handle a bumpy ride better than others. The problem with the Hyperloop \u2014 in its most ideal form \u2014 is that any turns it makes will make everyone uncomfortable. As a technology, the Hyperloop is one of the most intriguing projects under development right now. But we should approach it with a healthy sense of skepticism before we start to see how actual human passengers react to getting shipped around nine-tenths the speed of sound. ||||| Browser game tests you to survive Elon Musk\u2019s Hyperloop \n \n Excited by the prospect of high-speed travel by riding in a pod through airless tubes in Elon Musk\u2019s concept of the Hyperloop? Want to give it a try now? Well, there\u2019s a 8-bit styled web browser game that has you navigating a pod with the hope of keeping it one piece. Called Break-a-Pod, it\u2019s ridiculously hard in a similar way as Flappy Bird was, but it was actually created by a team that\u2019s building a pod prototype with the hope of bringing it to SpaceX, the company behind Hyperloop. \n \n The game has you controlling a pod\u2019s speed and stability, with a goal of \u201cgoing as fast as you can without crashing or running out of power.\u201d It\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s also much harder than it looks. You only need to use the four arrow keys, with up to accelerate, down to brake, and right/left to keep it stable. Hitting the sides of the tubes too many times or losing control of the pitch sees you instantly explode. \n \n The team behind the game, which calls themselves rLoop, after forming on Reddit, explains that they \u201chope that the game will act as a vehicle to make the Hyperloop concept fun and accessible to a wider audience, and inspire further research and engagement.\u201d \n \n Break-a-Pod was also released as a way to bring attention to rLoop\u2019s IndieGoGo campaign, which has a goal of raising $66,000 to finish building their prototype pod. Should they receive enough funds, the game might also see a mobile release on iOS and Android, giving them another source of raising money for the Hyperloop project. \n \n SpaceX has already held an open contest for pod designs. Out of hundreds of entrants, the rLoop team was selected as one of 18 finalists, and has been invited to the next stage of the competition. Scheduled to be held in California later this year, the event is supposed to see the prototypes demonstrated, but SpaceX hasn\u2019t yet finished building a section of test track. \n \n VIA The Verge ||||| Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF \n \n In 2015, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies filed a permit to build a 5-mile prototype in Quay Valley \u2014 a utopian, eco-friendly community planned for Central California. And while we\u2019re rooting for them to succeed with their test track, it still doesn\u2019t change the Hyperloop\u2019s largest challenges. Because the biggest hurdle isn\u2019t the tech behind Hyperloop, it\u2019s the land rights and every other bureaucratic obstacle that goes along with building enormous infrastructure projects. \n \n Back in the summer of 2013, Elon Musk announced to the world that he had a revolutionary idea about the future of transportation. He called his concept the Hyperloop, and everyone was excited that they\u2019d soon zip between distant major cities at 600 miles per hour. The tech press quickly picked apart the technical minutia of such a proposal, debating whether Musk\u2019s idea was technologically possible. What so many reporters then and since have continued to ignore is that you can\u2019t build a mode of transportation between cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles without rights to the land in between them. Not to mention the other challenges things like environmental impact reports or liability considerations. \n \n \u201cAfter over two and a half years of research and development our team has reached another important milestone. This will be the world\u2019s first passenger-ready Hyperloop system,\u201d Dirk Ahlborn, the CEO of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, said in a statement released to The Verge about the plans for Quay Valley. \u201cEveryone traveling on California\u2019s I-5 in 2016 will be able to see our activities from the freeway.\u201d \n \n With every puff piece that\u2019s published about companies like Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (not to be confused with competing company Hyperloop Technologies), everyone seems focused on the tech, rather than the real challenge: Land rights and bureaucracy. Assuming their permit is approved for Quay Valley, the idea of building a Hyperloop track between two distant cities remains a techno-utopian fantasy arguably as misguided as Quay Valley itself. \n \n Josh Stephens makes this same point in a recent blog post: \n \n And yet, this combination of enthusiasm and magnetism doesn\u2019t buy farmland. It doesn\u2019t ease eminent domain takings. It doesn\u2019t blast through bedrock or relocate utilities. It doesn\u2019t design station area plans. It doesn\u2019t write [Environmental Impact Reports] or dismiss [California Environmental Quality Act] suits. Trains, whether propelled by steam, diesel, or a frictionless tube, are still terrestrial things. And what terra we have in California. The very same mountains, cities, canals, farmers, and habitats that complicate [High Speed Rail] also complicate Hyperloop. The more the Hyperloop people drop hints and make innuendos about zipping this way and that without addressing the monumental public policy challenges that they\u2019re going to face, governmental cooperation they\u2019re going to need, and money that it\u2019s going to cost, the less it\u2019s going to sound like Tesla for the masses and the more it\u2019s going to sound like a lost chapter of \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n None of this is new. Even before the official announcement back in August of 2013, I wrote a post raising skepticism that you\u2019d be able to build a Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles without putting it underground or out in the ocean. And even then, you\u2019d still have to get land rights and work with the government in myriad ways. \n \n \n \n So we\u2019ll wait with earnest optimism as Hyperloop Transportation Technologies to build a working Hyperloop prototype in Quay Valley, a planned community on virgin soil by sometime this year. But until we hear that any Hyperloop company has a legal and lobbying team as big as its tech team, we\u2019re going to remain pretty damn skeptical that this will happen within our lifetime. \n \n Advertisement \n \n This post was originally published on January 20, 2016.",

But most of the time, they wanted the other option: \u201cbody cam.\u201d \n \n Watching through a smartphone app, the men would ask the women, some of the unknown thousands of North Koreans sold to Chinese husbands and living secretly in northern China, to show their breasts or their backsides, to touch themselves or perform sex acts on one another. \n \n Most of the time, the women did as requested. They needed the money \u2014 even if it amounted to only a few dollars a day. \n \n \u201cIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t think it was going to be a big deal. I thought it would be okay because I wasn\u2019t actually sleeping with anyone,\u201d said Suh, who, until dreams of escape brought her to this dingy room in Laos, had been one of the legions of North Korean women performing online sex work in back rooms in China. \u201cBut then I found out how many perverts there are out there.\u201d \n \n Suh, a 30-year-old who escaped from North Korea in 2008, resorted to doing \u201cvideo chatting\u201d after her second child was born and her husband\u2019s meager construction earnings wouldn\u2019t stretch any further. \n \n \u201cThere are some people who just want to look at your face, but the majority of them are there for their sexual desires,\u201d Suh said, putting her head down so her long hair covered her cherubic face. \u201cI felt so disgusting.\u201d \n \n Together with two women from her village in northeastern China who were also doing chatting work, Suh fled over the summer. She made the heart-wrenching decision to leave her 5-year-old daughter with her Chinese husband. \n \n The women traveled by bus and car down through China to the border with Laos, which they crossed illegally in the black of night, Suh carrying her 18-month-old daughter, Ji-yeon, on her back. \n \n The women made it to Vientiane, the Laotian capital, where a Washington Post reporter spent two days with them as they paused on their journey to what they hoped would be a better life. The women talked for hours about their lives in North Korea and in China but, unlike some defectors who exaggerate their stories to make them more sensational, they appeared to play down their experiences, apparently out of shame. \n \n [North Korea claims it has made warheads with \u2018higher strike power\u2019] \n \n Most of their stories could be verified with the pastor and broker who were helping them escape, and it was clear that the women, faced with no other options, had resorted to performing on camera for men. \n \n The women had a friend film them at work before they left, so they could prove what they had been doing. The videos showed the women \u2014 sometimes in brightly colored underwear, sometimes naked \u2014 sitting against a low bed covered with a purple Hello Kitty quilt in front of two computers on a low table. Men, sometimes visible, sometimes not, gave them instructions. Most of the men they \u201cchatted\u201d with online were in South Korea, but a few were in America and even Africa. \n \n Safely out of China, the other two women, both called Kim, wanted to get to South Korea, but Suh had her heart set on a more ambitious destination: the United States, \u201cthe strongest country on Earth.\u201d \n \n \u201cI think my daughter is one lucky baby,\u201d Suh said, sitting on the bed in a grimy room in Vientiane and looking at Ji-yeon as she slept, snoring lightly. Their few possessions were in plastic shopping bags, save for the clothes drying on coat hangers dangling from the light fittings. The baby had not even one toy. \u201cAll the suffering is worth it. Our destiny has changed,\u201d Suh said. \n \n \n \n Suh, a 30-year-old woman, carried her 18-month-old daughter Ji-yeon on her back as they illegally crossed the border from Laos into Thailand at night. \u201cI think my daughter is one lucky baby. All the suffering is worth it. Our destiny has changed,\u201d Suh said after they\u2019d arrived in Vientiane. (Sin Huh) \n \n Lives at risk \n \n Defections such as that of Thae Yong Ho, North Korea\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom who fled to South Korea over the summer, make headlines because they are so rare. But less sensationally, a steady if diminishing stream of North Koreans is making their way out, down through China, across to Laos, then into Thailand and eventually to South Korea. \n \n Most are women from the northern provinces, considered down-and-out even by North Korean standards, and face an extremely precarious life in northeastern China. Many had been sold \u2014 some knowingly, thinking life couldn\u2019t get any worse. But other women had been tricked into thinking they were heading to jobs in China, only to find that the man who offered to help them escape, paying bribes to border soldiers and arranging passage, turned out to be a trafficker, selling the women and pocketing the profits. \n \n The buyers are men in the countryside who are too poor or unappealing to get a wife any other way, and the women are stuck in remote villages where they cannot communicate with the locals \u2014 if they are permitted to leave the house, that is. \n \n Since Kim Jong Un took control of North Korea at the end of 2011, security has been tightened, and it has become increasingly difficult to escape. That has driven up prices. Women ages 15 to 25 are the most prized, fetching between $10,000 and $12,000, brokers and humanitarian workers say, while women in their 30s can be acquired for half that. \n \n Increased prices mean that some Chinese families are spending their entire life savings to buy a North Korean woman, and as a result the women are sometimes shackled inside the house. \n \n But even if the women are allowed out and even after they learn some Chinese, venturing into the open is a risky business. If they\u2019re caught by the Chinese police, they face repatriation to North Korea and, at a minimum, time in a labor camp. \n \n \u201cThese North Korean women in China faced a dire dilemma, either having to remain hidden and submit to this kind of sexual exploitation, or risk working outside of their residence with the very real possibility that Chinese authorities could arrest them at any time and force them back to North Korea,\u201d said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. \n \n The State Department\u2019s 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report noted that North Korean women and girls \u201care subjected to sexual slavery by Chinese or Korean-Chinese men, forced prostitution in brothels or through Internet sex sites, or compelled service as hostesses in nightclubs or karaoke bars.\u201d \n \n The State Department reported that the Chinese government \u201cdoes not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.\u201d \n \n Although some women take the risk of working outside the home, shuttling between cleaning and babysitting jobs or working behind the scenes in restaurants, an increasing number feel they have no choice but to try to make money behind closed doors. \n \n That is where video chatting comes in. \n \n [These North Korean missile launches add up to something very troubling] \n \n Online sex work vs. escape \n \n About one-fifth of the North Korean women living in hiding in China are involved in this kind of online sex work, said Park, a broker who works to get women out. \n \n The Post agreed to withhold Park\u2019s full name to avoid jeopardizing this highly sensitive work. The newspaper also agreed to use the women\u2019s family names only, partly to protect relatives in North Korea. \n \n \u201cIf you\u2019re working in a restaurant or outside, you run the risk of being asked for your papers by the police. So doing this work is safer and the money is better,\u201d Park said. \u201cIn the village where they lived, every North Korean woman does this. It\u2019s so normal to be doing this.\u201d \n \n Some North Korean women in China are forced into this work, essentially held prisoner by pimps. The women The Post met were not forced, as such. But they had few other opportunities. \n \n Suh was sold eight years ago to a man in northern China who, she said, treated her well \u2014 he beat her \u201conly a few times.\u201d But the arrival of their second child made a tough financial situation untenable.

They found out about Park and Kim Sung-eun, a pastor from the Caleb Mission, a church in South Korea that helps bring defectors to safety, and asked to be helped out. For the second time in their lives, they escaped, this time to a safe house in northern China, and from there they made the journey to the border, then walked to Laos. \n \n \u201cI was so scared, but I kept on going, I just kept on going,\u201d Suh said. \u201cI kept walking toward Pastor Kim and Park.\u201d \n \n \n \n The women make the treacherous journey from southern China to Laos, walking across the border in the dark.

(Sin Huh) \n \n Laos was safer but still somewhat of a gray area; they may be sent back. Once they got to Thailand, the fear of repatriation to North Korea would be gone. \n \n While waiting to cross the Mekong River, the women talked about the difficult decisions they had had to make. Suh\u2019s 5-year-old is listed on her Chinese father\u2019s family register, which gives her legal status in China and enables her to go to school. But by the time Ji-yeon was born, the back channel for registration \u2014 involving bribes to willing officials \u2014 had closed. The baby doesn\u2019t legally exist. \n \n So when Suh decided to flee and realized she could only manage to take one child with her, she knew it had to be Ji-yeon. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019ve abandoned her,\u201d Suh said, breaking down into another torrent of tears as she recalled telling her older daughter she would be back soon. \n \n The day they were to cross into Thailand, the women were full of nervous excitement. But things soon went wrong. Heavy rain had swollen the Mekong, and their boat missed the drop point. \n \n They were discovered by local police and taken to a prison. They were terrified and sent an endless stream of messages to Park, asking if they would be sent back to North Korea. One photo they sent showed Ji-yeon standing in a cell, looking out through the bars. \n \n [Reaching a South Korean audience by finding laughs from North Korea] \n \n Instead, they were taken to Bangkok, where they are now being held at a detention center, the pastor said. \n \n Suh has applied for asylum in the United States, even though she speaks no English and knows she will receive little support, unlike in South Korea. Officials from the American Embassy in Bangkok have met with Suh and her daughter, the pastor said. He estimated that it would take about four months for their asylum claims to be processed. \n \n An embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok declined to comment. The United States has accepted 74 refugees from North Korea since Kim took power, according to State Department data. \n \n During the pause in Vientiane, the relief of being out of China had washed over the women, and the challenges ahead loomed.

As a result, the Chinese public security officials investigated the matter, found the responsible people and deported them.\u201d \n \n \n \n Another source from China told RFA that North Korean women working in the country are frequently forced into prostitution. \n \n \n \n \u201cIt simply hasn\u2019t come out in the past, but there have been many similar situations,\u201d he said, adding that he blamed the North Korean handler\u2019s \u201clack of morality\u201d for the recent deportation of the female food factory workers. \n \n \n \n Vulnerable to trafficking \n \n \n \n There are no official figures on the total number of North Koreans working in China, but in January, China\u2019s National Tourism Administration reported that 93,300 North Koreans were granted work visas to enter the country in 2013, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. \n \n \n \n A Korean peddler of Chinese ethnicity surnamed Ju said that while the opportunity to earn foreign currency as a worker in China had been highly sought after in the past, people were growing increasingly wary. \n \n \n \n \u201cIn the past, it was very hard to be hired as a worker at a restaurant in China where one can earn foreign currency, but it\u2019s no longer popular [to try],\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n \u201cMany parents know that female workers are driven to illegal acts while working abroad, including prostitution.\u201d \n \n \n \n Multiple sources told RFA that North Korean workers and waitresses who are sent to China find it hard to refuse unreasonable requests from corrupt handlers, because they fear repatriation. \n \n \n \n There are also several thousand North Korean women who flee their country to China to avoid blatant human rights abuses. \n \n \n \n According to the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2013 Trafficking in Persons report, China is a destination for women and girls, \u201clargely from neighboring countries,\u201d who are sometimes subjected to forced marriage and forced prostitution upon arrival. \n \n \n \n \u201cThe government continued to treat North Koreans found in China as illegal economic migrants, despite credible independent reporting that many North Korean female refugees in China are trafficking victims,\u201d the report said. \n \n \n \n \u201cThe government detained and deported such refugees to North Korea, where they may face severe punishment, even death, including in North Korean forced labor camps.\u201d \n \n \n \n The Chinese government did not provide North Korean trafficking victims with legal alternatives to repatriation, while Chinese authorities sometimes prosecuted citizens who assisted North Korean refugees and trafficking victims. \n \n \n \n The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is barred from access to North Koreans in northeast China, leaving them vulnerable to human traffickers, the report said. \n \n \n \n Reported by Joon Ho Kim for RFA\u2019s Korean Service.

But most of the time, they wanted the other option: \u201cbody cam.\u201d \n \n Watching through a smartphone app, the men would ask the women, some of the unknown thousands of North Koreans sold to Chinese husbands and living secretly in northern China, to show their breasts or their backsides, to touch themselves or perform sex acts on one another. \n \n Most of the time, the women did as requested. They needed the money \u2014 even if it amounted to only a few dollars a day. \n \n \u201cIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t think it was going to be a big deal. I thought it would be okay because I wasn\u2019t actually sleeping with anyone,\u201d said Suh, who, until dreams of escape brought her to this dingy room in Laos, had been one of the legions of North Korean women performing online sex work in back rooms in China. \u201cBut then I found out how many perverts there are out there.\u201d \n \n Suh, a 30-year-old who escaped from North Korea in 2008, resorted to doing \u201cvideo chatting\u201d after her second child was born and her husband\u2019s meager construction earnings wouldn\u2019t stretch any further. \n \n \u201cThere are some people who just want to look at your face, but the majority of them are there for their sexual desires,\u201d Suh said, putting her head down so her long hair covered her cherubic face. \u201cI felt so disgusting.\u201d \n \n Together with two women from her village in northeastern China who were also doing chatting work, Suh fled over the summer. She made the heart-wrenching decision to leave her 5-year-old daughter with her Chinese husband. \n \n The women traveled by bus and car down through China to the border with Laos, which they crossed illegally in the black of night, Suh carrying her 18-month-old daughter, Ji-yeon, on her back. \n \n The women made it to Vientiane, the Laotian capital, where a Washington Post reporter spent two days with them as they paused on their journey to what they hoped would be a better life. The women talked for hours about their lives in North Korea and in China but, unlike some defectors who exaggerate their stories to make them more sensational, they appeared to play down their experiences, apparently out of shame. \n \n [North Korea claims it has made warheads with \u2018higher strike power\u2019] \n \n Most of their stories could be verified with the pastor and broker who were helping them escape, and it was clear that the women, faced with no other options, had resorted to performing on camera for men. \n \n The women had a friend film them at work before they left, so they could prove what they had been doing. The videos showed the women \u2014 sometimes in brightly colored underwear, sometimes naked \u2014 sitting against a low bed covered with a purple Hello Kitty quilt in front of two computers on a low table. Men, sometimes visible, sometimes not, gave them instructions. Most of the men they \u201cchatted\u201d with online were in South Korea, but a few were in America and even Africa. \n \n Safely out of China, the other two women, both called Kim, wanted to get to South Korea, but Suh had her heart set on a more ambitious destination: the United States, \u201cthe strongest country on Earth.\u201d \n \n \u201cI think my daughter is one lucky baby,\u201d Suh said, sitting on the bed in a grimy room in Vientiane and looking at Ji-yeon as she slept, snoring lightly. Their few possessions were in plastic shopping bags, save for the clothes drying on coat hangers dangling from the light fittings. The baby had not even one toy. \u201cAll the suffering is worth it. Our destiny has changed,\u201d Suh said. \n \n \n \n Suh, a 30-year-old woman, carried her 18-month-old daughter Ji-yeon on her back as they illegally crossed the border from Laos into Thailand at night. \u201cI think my daughter is one lucky baby. All the suffering is worth it. Our destiny has changed,\u201d Suh said after they\u2019d arrived in Vientiane. (Sin Huh) \n \n Lives at risk \n \n Defections such as that of Thae Yong Ho, North Korea\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom who fled to South Korea over the summer, make headlines because they are so rare. But less sensationally, a steady if diminishing stream of North Koreans is making their way out, down through China, across to Laos, then into Thailand and eventually to South Korea. \n \n Most are women from the northern provinces, considered down-and-out even by North Korean standards, and face an extremely precarious life in northeastern China. Many had been sold \u2014 some knowingly, thinking life couldn\u2019t get any worse. But other women had been tricked into thinking they were heading to jobs in China, only to find that the man who offered to help them escape, paying bribes to border soldiers and arranging passage, turned out to be a trafficker, selling the women and pocketing the profits. \n \n The buyers are men in the countryside who are too poor or unappealing to get a wife any other way, and the women are stuck in remote villages where they cannot communicate with the locals \u2014 if they are permitted to leave the house, that is. \n \n Since Kim Jong Un took control of North Korea at the end of 2011, security has been tightened, and it has become increasingly difficult to escape. That has driven up prices. Women ages 15 to 25 are the most prized, fetching between $10,000 and $12,000, brokers and humanitarian workers say, while women in their 30s can be acquired for half that. \n \n Increased prices mean that some Chinese families are spending their entire life savings to buy a North Korean woman, and as a result the women are sometimes shackled inside the house. \n \n But even if the women are allowed out and even after they learn some Chinese, venturing into the open is a risky business. If they\u2019re caught by the Chinese police, they face repatriation to North Korea and, at a minimum, time in a labor camp. \n \n \u201cThese North Korean women in China faced a dire dilemma, either having to remain hidden and submit to this kind of sexual exploitation, or risk working outside of their residence with the very real possibility that Chinese authorities could arrest them at any time and force them back to North Korea,\u201d said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. \n \n The State Department\u2019s 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report noted that North Korean women and girls \u201care subjected to sexual slavery by Chinese or Korean-Chinese men, forced prostitution in brothels or through Internet sex sites, or compelled service as hostesses in nightclubs or karaoke bars.\u201d \n \n The State Department reported that the Chinese government \u201cdoes not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.\u201d \n \n Although some women take the risk of working outside the home, shuttling between cleaning and babysitting jobs or working behind the scenes in restaurants, an increasing number feel they have no choice but to try to make money behind closed doors. \n \n That is where video chatting comes in. \n \n [These North Korean missile launches add up to something very troubling] \n \n Online sex work vs. escape \n \n About one-fifth of the North Korean women living in hiding in China are involved in this kind of online sex work, said Park, a broker who works to get women out. \n \n The Post agreed to withhold Park\u2019s full name to avoid jeopardizing this highly sensitive work. The newspaper also agreed to use the women\u2019s family names only, partly to protect relatives in North Korea. \n \n \u201cIf you\u2019re working in a restaurant or outside, you run the risk of being asked for your papers by the police. So doing this work is safer and the money is better,\u201d Park said. \u201cIn the village where they lived, every North Korean woman does this. It\u2019s so normal to be doing this.\u201d \n \n Some North Korean women in China are forced into this work, essentially held prisoner by pimps. The women The Post met were not forced, as such. But they had few other opportunities. \n \n Suh was sold eight years ago to a man in northern China who, she said, treated her well \u2014 he beat her \u201conly a few times.\u201d But the arrival of their second child made a tough financial situation untenable.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Why are our lives so different, just because of where we are born?\" That's the question posed to the Washington Post by Suh, a 30-year-old North Korean woman now being held in a Bangkok detention center after being busted by local cops while trying to cross from Laos to Thailand. And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea\u2014either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says. And it's what led Suh (who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind) and the two other women to try to escape once more\u2014this time to Laos, then to Thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to North Korea.

    "document": "Presence of 3rd person's genetic markers never before revealed \n \n John Ramsey looks on as his wife Patsy Ramsey holds an ad promising a reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer of their 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, during a television interview on May 1, 1997. Eleven years later, Boulder's top prosecutor exonerated the Ramseys \u2014 but a new independent analysis of DNA evidence in the case calls that into question. ( Patrick Davison / Rocky Mountain News via AP ) \n \n The DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case doesn't support a pivotal and controversial development in Colorado's most vexing unsolved murder \u2014 a former Boulder prosecutor's decision to clear the girl's family from all suspicion in her death, a joint Daily Camera/9NEWS investigation has found. \n \n Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained exclusively by the two news organizations disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy's conclusion that a DNA profile found in one place on JonBenet's underpants and two locations on her long johns was necessarily the killer's \u2014 which Lacy had asserted in clearing JonBenet's family of suspicion. \n \n In fact, those experts said the evidence showed that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns came from at least two people in addition to JonBenet \u2014 something Lacy's office was told, according to documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, but that she made no mention of in clearing the Ramseys. \n \n The presence of a third person's genetic markers has never before been publicly revealed. \n \n Additionally, the independent experts raised the possibility that the original DNA sample recovered from JonBenet's underwear \u2014 long used to identify or exclude potential suspects \u2014 could be a composite and not that of a single individual. \n \n About this story Charlie Brennan of the Daily Camera and Kevin Vaughan of 9NEWS exclusively obtained laboratory test results and reports from the JonBenet Ramsey case on which then-Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy based her decision to exonerate members of the Ramsey family. The reporters sought a review of that evidence by independent experts. This is the result of their investigation. \n \n More from 9NEWS See additional coverage of the DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case at 9 and 10 p.m. Thursday and Friday on KUSA-Channel 9, or watch the full report at 9NEWS.com. \n \n \"It's a rather obvious point, but I mean, if you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,\" said Troy Eid, a former U.S. Attorney for Colorado. \n \n The documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS included results from the actual DNA testing process on the long johns and summary reports sent to Lacy's office in the months leading up her July 9, 2008, letter exonerating the Ramseys. \n \n The experts who examined the laboratory results at the request of the Camera and 9NEWS reached similar conclusions on multiple points: \n \n \u2022 Two of the three samples that led Lacy to declare publicly that no one in the Ramsey family could be responsible for the murder actually appear to include genetic material from at least three people: JonBenet, the person whose DNA profile originally was located in JonBenet's underwear during testing in the late 1990s and early 2000s, plus at least one additional as-yet-unidentified person or persons. Consequently, its meaning is far from clear. \n \n \u2022 The DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1 \u2014 first identified during testing on the panties \u2014 may not be the DNA of a single person at all, but, rather, a composite of genetic material from multiple individuals. As a result, it may be worthless as evidence. \n \n \u2022 The presence of that DNA on JonBenet's underwear and long johns, be it from one or multiple people, may very well be innocent; the profiles were developed from minute samples that could have been the result of inconsequential contact with other people, or transferred from another piece of clothing. If true, it would contradict the assertions that DNA will be key to finding JonBenet's killer. \n \n A Boulder police officer sits in her cruiser on Jan. 3, 1997, outside the 15th Street home in which 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found dead on Dec. 26, 1996. The murder remains unsolved nearly 20 years later. (David Zalubowski / Associated Press) \n \n This represents the first time independent experts have reviewed the DNA evidence on which Lacy based her widely questioned exoneration of the family. \n \n And the findings could cut both ways. \n \n \"It's certainly possible that an intruder was responsible for the murder, but I don't think that the DNA evidence proves it,\" said William C. Thompson, a professor in the Department of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California-Irvine and an internationally respected authority on DNA evidence and its applications in the criminal justice system. \n \n Similarly, the findings don't implicate or exonerate anyone in the family. \n \n Ramsey lawyer Lin Wood, who has not reviewed the documents or the work of the experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS, said, however, \"I have absolute and total confidence in the integrity of former District Attorney Mary Lacy, and I am also aware of internet comments by former Boulder police Chief Mark Beckner where he, within the last several months, affirmed that the Ramsey case was a DNA case. \n \n \"So I know what Chief Beckner has said publicly in recent months, I know what ... former District Attorney Mary Lacy has said, and until someone impugns her integrity, or contradicts former Chief Beckner's statement, I continue to believe, as I have said before, that this is a DNA case and that the best chance for solving the case will be a hit and match on the DNA in the future. I hope that day comes.\" \n \n 'The silver bullet misfired' \n \n Lacy was long known as a believer in the Ramseys' innocence, something others noticed as early as June 1998, when Boulder police detectives put on a detailed two-day presentation of the evidence and sought either charges against John and Patsy Ramsey or a grand jury investigation. \n \n \"My impression of her response to that was that she was among the very, very skeptical,\" said former Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, who attended the police presentation in his role as adviser to then-Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter. \n \n The experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS suggested that Lacy may have been guilty of \"confirmation bias,\" a phenomenon in which investigators become so blinded by their own theories that they give extra credence to evidence that supports them, and ignore evidence that does not. \n \n The lab that performed the DNA testing, for example, told Lacy in March 2008 that it was \"likely\" the two samples found on JonBenet's long johns came from \"more than two people\" and \"should not be considered a single-source profile,\" according to the documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS. \n \n But in exonerating the Ramseys with a three-page letter made public July 9, 2008, Lacy failed to disclose any of that, writing that \"the previously identified profile from the crotch of the underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of the murder matched the DNA recovered from the long johns.\" \n \n The word \"match\" actually never appears in the reports from Bode Technology, which conducted the testing in March through June of 2008. \n \n Similarly, the Camera and 9NEWS have learned that investigators in Lacy's office suggested no additional testing was needed once they learned male DNA had been located on the long johns that she later labeled as a \"match\" to the DNA found in JonBenet's panties. \n \n Correspondence from an investigator on Lacy's staff indicated that \"my bosses\" were \"very excited\" and \"pleased\" about the purported match, \"and don't see the need for additional testing (unless you strongly recommend otherwise).\" \n \n The twin realities pointed to by the experts \u2014 that the genetic profile may not be from a single individual and that DNA on the girl's clothing may have landed there innocently \u2014 turn on its head Lacy's assertion that investigators had identified the killer's genetic fingerprint and that it was the key critical to solving the case. \n \n Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor, noted that many people have come to see DNA evidence as a foolproof \"silver bullet\" to solving many crimes. \n \n \"Here, the silver bullet misfired,\" said Thompson, one of the experts who reviewed the evidence at the news organizations' request. \n \n 'Something I can't explain' \n \n Former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who called for a review of the Ramsey case in October 1999 to determine whether it merited the attention of a statewide grand jury \u2014 his panel of advisers told him it did not \u2014 said Lacy's exoneration made no sense to him at the time and is even more troubling now. \n \n \"This is an important development. This is new information,\" Owens said. \n \n \"She knew, based on your investigation, that this DNA wasn't necessarily from one person and that it, in fact, was potentially accumulated DNA,\" Owens said. \"She knew it at the time, and why she used this evidence to clear the Ramsey family ... is something I can't explain. And she should explain.\" \n \n Lacy did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story, sent to her by email, U.S. mail and left at her home. \n \n Donald R. Von Hagen, a spokesman for Virginia-based Bode Cellmark Forensics, as the lab is now known, said in an email that the company's report \"stands on its own\" and that he would not have further comment. \n \n The murder of JonBenet exploded into the national consciousness within days of the discovery of her body on Dec. 26, 1996, in the sprawling home she shared with her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and older brother, Burke, on 15th Street in Boulder. The 6-year-old's skull was fractured by a blow to the head, and her killer cinched a garrote around her neck, placed duct tape over her mouth and bound her wrists. \n \n Everyone from seasoned investigators to amateur sleuths to talk show hosts quickly settled on one of two theories: That JonBenet was slain by someone in her family, either accidentally or in a fit of rage, and that the killer then tried to make it look like a botched kidnapping; or, that she was the victim of a cunning intruder who intended to spirit the child out of the house, but ended up committing murder instead. \n \n John Ramsey, the girl's father, declined a request for an interview. \n \n \"I think we have said all that can be said and I need to get back to my job!\" Ramsey wrote in an email. \n \n 'We don't actually have to live with it' \n \n The implications of the conclusions reached by the experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS could, if considered by investigators still working the state's most famous cold case, dramatically impact the future direction of their work. At the time the Bode results were returned, Lacy's office had control of the Ramsey investigation, and Boulder police did not reclaim responsibility for the probe until Lacy left office the following year. \n \n On one hand, it could lead detectives to consider anew the possibility that someone in JonBenet's family was responsible for her death. And it could also lead them to take a new look at dozens of potential suspects who were ruled out because their DNA didn't match the profile known as Unknown Male 1. \n \n Eid, who served as Owens' chief counsel and was on the governor's statewide panel that reviewed the case in 1999, said in a recent interview he had suspected in 2008 that Lacy's exoneration was, at the very least, misleading. \n \n \"But now, it really looks wrong in the scheme of things,\" Eid said. \"And it's not one of these instances where you think, in hindsight, she made a tough call, but we've got to live with it. No, we actually don't have to live with it anymore. Right?\" \n \n Lacy's successor as Boulder's district attorney, Stan Garnett, remembers exactly where he was when he learned of Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramseys: sitting at LaGuardia Airport in New York waiting for a flight home when news of Lacy's letter crawled across a television screen. Although he called Lacy \"an honorable person\" and an \"honest district attorney,\" he also said he was \u2014 and is \u2014 puzzled by her decision. \n \n The job of a district attorney is to file charges in cases where the evidence warrants it, Garnett said. \n \n \"Our role is not to issue random exonerations of people in cases, and it's very confusing when that happens,\" Garnett added. \n \n Although Garnett said he is not bound by Lacy's decision, it has lasting ramifications for countless people beyond John Ramsey and Burke Ramsey, now 29. Patsy Ramsey succumbed to ovarian cancer in June 2006. \n \n Boulder police investigators continue to use the problematic DNA profile known as Unknown Male 1 to clear others who might potentially have been involved in the killing. A case investigator said dozens of suspects have been cleared that way. \n \n Boulder police Chief Greg Testa declined this week to comment on the DNA evidence. But in a video statement released to all media on Sept. 1, Testa said detectives in the department had submitted more than 200 DNA samples in the case for analysis. \n \n 'This could easily be a composite profile' \n \n At the crux of the evidence is the DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1. \n \n That profile was first developed in late 1998 and early 1999 from tests on JonBenet's panties \u2014 but analysts couldn't at that time identify sufficient genetic markers. Sending it to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System \u2014 the national genetic database commonly known as CODIS \u2014 requires at least 10 markers. \n \n Further lab work in 2003 yielded an additional marker, and the profile, featuring the required minimum of 10 genetic markers, was entered into CODIS that December. \n \n \"People believed back in those days almost all mixtures are two-person mixtures \u2014 that was like gospel truth,\" said Phillip Danielson, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Denver and science adviser to the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center. \n \n In the ensuing years, as the \"kits\" used to detect DNA became ever more sensitive, scientists came to realize that many mixtures contained genetic markers from more than two people. \n \n \"You know,\" Danielson said, \"looking at the profiles in this case, it seems pretty clear that their idea of this 'unknown male' \u2014 this could easily be a composite profile. Meaning that we have multiple contributors. But because of the low sensitivity of the kit, they interpreted those multiple contributors as being just one extra person.\" \n \n However, Lacy \u2014 and others \u2014 concluded that profile must belong to JonBenet's killer. \n \n Against that backdrop, an investigator in Lacy's office submitted JonBenet's panties, long johns, nightgown and other items for further testing at Bode's lab in Lorton, Va., in late 2007 and early 2008. \n \n The Bode scientists could not replicate the profile found in JonBenet's panties, which bothered Danielson as he examined the materials obtained by the two news organizations. \n \n \"Reproducibility and repeatability is a hallmark of science,\" Danielson said. \"To me, as a scientist, that does raise concern. If there was this unknown male DNA on the underwear, you would expect that Bode would have been able to reproduce that. Now, are there any possible explanations why they would not be? Sure.\" \n \n The sample could have been degraded, though Danielson said that's not likely given the way evidence is handled and stored. Another possibility is that the original tests consumed all of the foreign genetic material in the panties. It's also possible that variations in the way the original tests were done could account for the failure to find the same profile in the panties during the 2008 tests. \n \n 'Should not be considered a single source profile' \n \n When analysts at Bode tested the long johns, they focused on four distinct areas: the inside and outside of both the upper left and upper right sides of the garment. The tests on the two spots on the inside of the long johns yielded too little DNA to be useful. \n \n But on the outside of the long johns, Bode analysts found much more DNA. \n \n According to a March 24, 2008, report from Bode, a copy of which was obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, the sample from the right side, labeled as 2S07-101-05A, included DNA containing \"a mixture of at least two individuals including the victim and at least one male contributor.\" They got the same results on the left side, which was labeled 2S07-101-05B. \n \n But in notes included with the report, it's clear the Bode analysts concluded that those two samples contained genetic material from at least three people. After assuming that JonBenet was one of those people, the analysts were left with the \"remaining DNA contribution.\" \n \n \"Based on the results,\" according to the report, \"it is likely more than two people contributed to the mixtures observed in 2S07-101-05A and 2S07-101-05B therefore, the remaining DNA contribution should not be considered a single source profile.\" \n \n Christopher McKee, a former public defender in both Atlanta and Washington, D.C., and now director of the Schaden Experiential Learning & Public Service Programs at the University of Colorado Law School, concurred. \n \n \"My own personal review of the material and looking at the allele information at the various loci is that it looks and appears to me to be at least three individuals,\" McKee said. McKee also teaches an advanced course on Forensic Science in the Courts at the CU Law School, teaches on the subject around the country and has been recognized by courts and nationally as an expert on the topic. \n \n Danielson also said, \"There are too many alleles to be accounted for by only JonBenet and this alleged Unknown Male No. 1 profile.\" \n \n An allele is a specific genetic marker. \n \n Lacy's investigator asked Bode's analysts to compare the DNA from the two spots on the outside of the long johns with the Unknown Male 1 profile. \n \n Bode's analysts concluded that Unknown Male 1 \"could not be excluded as a possible contributor to the mixture DNA profile\" obtained from the outside of the long johns on the right side, according to a June 20, 2008, report obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS. On the left side, the Unknown Male 1 profile \"cannot be included or excluded from the mixture DNA profile.\" \n \n In other words, the link between the two spots on the long johns and the DNA in the underwear is tenuous at best, according to analysts at the lab Lacy used for the testing. \n \n 'There is no innocent explanation' \n \n But a little more than two weeks later, Lacy wrote the letter clearing members of the Ramsey family of suspicion. However, she included none of the caveats spelled out in the Bode reports and used language suggesting the lab work was ironclad. \n \n \"The Bode Technology laboratory was able to develop a profile from DNA recovered from the two sides of the long johns,\" Lacy wrote. \"The previously identified profile from the crotch of the underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of the murder matched the DNA recovered from the long johns at Bode. \n \n \"Despite substantial efforts over the years to identify the source of this DNA, there is no innocent explanation for its incriminating presence at three sites on those two different items of clothing that JonBenet was wearing at the time of her murder.\" \n \n The experts consulted by the news organizations disagreed, to varying degrees, on both assertions \u2014 that the Unknown Male 1 profile \"matched\" the DNA found on the outside of the long johns, and that there was \"no innocent explanation\" for the presence of that DNA on JonBenet's clothing. \n \n \"You have to understand a match is an analyst's judgment that the two samples fall into the 'included' category,\" Thompson said. \"A match doesn't mean that the material examined is necessarily identical \u2014 just that there's a sufficient consistency to think that it might have come from the same source.\" \n \n Thompson said his analysis found \"a strong level of consistency\" between the two long johns samples and the Unknown Male 1 profile. \n \n \"But,\" he said, \"there are also some genetic characteristics that could not be accounted for by either JonBenet Ramsey or Unknown Male 1, thus suggesting there could be DNA from other people.\" \n \n Danielson and another expert consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS offered similar opinions. \n \n \"To simply state that there's no innocent way that this DNA could have arrived at separate sites on JonBenet's underwear ... there's simply no scientific justification to make such a statement,\" Danielson said. \"It's just simply not true.\" \n \n Danielson offered a hypothetical: Say JonBenet had physical contact with other kids she was recently playing with, or had contact at a party on Christmas night, or say she touched anything bearing others' DNA; she could have then transferred that genetic material to her own clothes simply while getting dressed. \n \n McKee, based on his review of the evidence, called Lacy's actions based on the lab reports \"a cautionary tale.\" \n \n \"I don't think her letter at all reflects an appreciation or understanding for what that said in the report,\" McKee said. \"You know, as I read the (Lacy) letter, it seems to suggest that there's just one single profile that was found here.\" \n \n 'False logic of declaring this as exonerating' \n \n Michael Kane, who served as lead counsel to the Ramsey grand jury, is now senior legal counsel to the Judiciary Committee in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He expressed little surprise that Lacy's decision had been thrown into serious doubt. \n \n \"Until you ID who that (unknown sample) is, you can't make that kind of statement (that Lacy made),\" Kane said in an email. \"There may be circumstances where male DNA is discovered on or in the body of a victim of a sexual assault where you can say with a degree of certainty that had to have been from the perpetrator and from that, draw the conclusion that someone who doesn't meet that profile is excluded. \n \n \"But in a case like this, where the DNA is not from sperm, is only on the clothing and not her body, until you know whose it is, you can't say how it got there. And until you can say how it got there, you can't connect it to the crime and conclude it excludes anyone else as the perpetrator. And that's the false logic of declaring this as exonerating. It seems to me to be pretty self-evident.\" \n \n As for potentially innocent explanations to the presence of DNA on the clothes JonBenet was wearing when she died, all three experts said they are numerous. \n \n \"There have been some very intriguing studies where they had people hold hands for a very short period of time and then touch a knife handle,\" Danielson said. \n \n In some cases, subsequent tests found DNA from both people on the knife. In others, DNA from only the person who actually touched the knife. And in still others, no DNA was found from the person who actually touched the knife, yet DNA from the other person was found. \n \n Thompson recently testified in a case involving sex toys. Analysts located DNA on the sex toys, Thompson said, in \"quantities comparable\" to that found on JonBenet's long johns \u2014 but it turned out to have no link to the crime. \n \n \"The DNA came from a person who had carried the wrapped items from the crime scene to a truck to take to the crime lab,\" Thompson said. \"So somebody who had never touched the items, but had touched the exterior of the wrappers of the items, that person's DNA was apparently transferred onto the wrappers. Then when the wrapped items got back to the crime lab and were unwrapped, the analyst apparently touched the wrappers and then touched the items, transferring it onto the items \u2014 in a way that made it indistinguishable from DNA that would have been deposited there during that crime. \n \n \"So if that can happen in this sexual assault case that I worked on, it's easy to imagine similar scenarios that could have gotten the DNA found on JonBenet Ramsey's clothing to where it was found. And I think the fact that DNA can be transferred so easily in small quantities is a weakness of the technology at this time.\" \n \n 'Can't get my arms around that one' \n \n Lacy established herself as a supporter of the intruder theory in the Ramsey case when she was still Mary Keenan, a chief deputy specializing in sexual assault cases under the man she would soon succeed, then-District Attorney Alex Hunter. \n \n In June 1998, JonBenet's parents were questioned at length for the second time \u2014 Patsy Ramsey by Denver district attorney's investigator Tom Haney and Boulder prosecutor Trip DeMuth, and John Ramsey by retired El Paso County homicide detective Lou Smit and Kane, the attorney who directed the grand jury investigation. \n \n Lacy wasn't directly involved in the interrogations. But Haney recalls that after she saw videotape of the interview with Patsy Ramsey, Lacy chided him for being hard on JonBenet's mother. \n \n Haney said Lacy volunteering such an opinion seemed odd to him at the time. And, he said in a recent interview, \"It still does.\" \n \n Lacy took other steps that left many to believe she ruled out the Ramseys as suspects long before she issued her letter in 2008. \n \n Lacy succeeded Hunter as Boulder County's elected district attorney in 2001. It was in that role that, in 2003, she made her first public proclamation on her belief in the Ramseys' innocence. \n \n A federal judge in Atlanta \u2014 in dismissing a libel case filed against the Ramseys by a journalist they named as a potential suspect in their 2000 book \"The Death of Innocence\" \u2014 ruled that exhibits in the case led her to believe an intruder was more likely to have killed JonBenet than Patsy Ramsey. \n \n Although Lacy had not been a party to that suit, she nevertheless volunteered a public statement in support of the federal judge's ruling, saying, \"I agree with the conclusion that the weight of the evidence is more consistent with the theory that an intruder murdered JonBenet than it is with a theory that Mrs. Ramsey did so.\" \n \n After Patsy Ramsey succumbed to ovarian cancer in 2006 following a 13-year battle, she was buried alongside JonBenet in St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Ga. Lacy attended her funeral. \n \n Former Boulder police detective Steve Thomas, who had investigated the case in its first years, said that stunned him. \n \n \"I know of no other case in which a sitting district attorney or prosecutor attended the funeral of a person whom she knew a grand jury had voted to criminally indict, and traveled across the country to do so, as Mary Lacy did in the case of Patsy Ramsey,\" he wrote in an email. \n \n \"I can't get my arms around that one. I can assure you that many in law enforcement were also distressed by it.\" \n \n Thomas quit the investigation in August 1998 over multiple frustrations, including Hunter's reluctance at that time to take the case to a grand jury. He later wrote a book about the case and was sued by the Ramseys. That suit resulted in an undisclosed settlement. \n \n 'Culmination of what she wanted' \n \n Lacy also presided over what is widely seen as one of the greatest debacles in a case marred by numerous missteps: the high-profile 2006 arrest of John Mark Karr, a suspect unearthed by University of Colorado journalism professor Michael Tracey, followed almost immediately by an about-face. \n \n Karr was arrested in Thailand and brought back to Boulder with a sea of photographers recording virtually every moment of his transport \u2014 only to be abruptly cut loose a few days after arriving in Colorado when his DNA was found not to match the Unknown Male 1 sample. \n \n Numerous experts have cautioned about the importance of maintaining objectivity, both that of the scientists examining forensic samples, and those who are evaluating the results. They also underscored the importance of severely limiting what is termed contextual information, which is supplied to a laboratory along with items to be tested. \n \n In the case of testing done by Bode Technology for Lacy's office, the Bode staff was provided not only a PowerPoint presentation on the case, but a six-page Nov. 7, 2007, letter providing background so extensive that it even made mention that John Ramsey was president of Access Graphics, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary that had just cleared $1 billion in sales at the time of JonBenet's murder. \n \n \"Just as they need to make sure that evidence is not physically contaminated, you want to make sure that they're not cognitively contaminated, so that they're not aware and influenced by irrelevant contextual information that biases how they perceive and interpret the information, the judgments they make,\" said Itiel Dror, senior cognitive neuroscience researcher at University College London. He has presented training at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Justice and elsewhere on objectivity in forensic examination. \n \n \"The investigators, the lawyers and everybody else need to stay emotionally disconnected from the case as much as humanly possible, so they keep as objective as possible and not fall into a lot of cognitive problems, wishful thinking, self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Dror said. \n \n Grant, the former Adams County district attorney, was skeptical about the Karr arrest at the time as he watched it unfold from a distance. \n \n \"Just listening to him, and seeing the televised interviews, it just struck me as improbable that he had anything to do with it,\" Grant said. \n \n Lacy, he said, \"was one of the folks that was more skeptical of the someone-in-the-house theory from the beginning. When she agreed \u2014 I thought, hastily \u2014 to bring Mr. Karr back on the flimsiest of non-evidence, it kind of cemented for me that she was looking for some way to bolster the intruder theory.\" \n \n And alluding to the exoneration letter of July 2008, Grant said, \"That was the culmination of what she wanted to do all along.\" \n \n Not a DNA case 'pure and simple' \n \n The ramifications for the case in the wake of Lacy's letter were considerable, and continue to reverberate to this day. \n \n The day Lacy issued the letter, John Ramsey hailed the news in an exclusive interview with 9NEWS. \n \n \"The most significant thing to me was the fact that we now have pretty irrefutable DNA evidence, according to the DA's office,\" Ramsey said. \"And that's the most significant thing to me. And certainly we are grateful that they acknowledged that we, you know based on that, certainly could not have been involved. But the most important thing was we now have very, very solid evidence.\" \n \n It was first reported by the Camera in January 2013 that the grand jury that heard the Ramsey case from September 1998 to October 1999 had signed indictments against both John and Patsy Ramsey, charging both with child abuse resulting in death. \n \n Hunter declined to file those indictments with the court and prosecute the case at trial. While the standard for filing of charges is that of probable cause, the hurdle for conviction is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and Hunter didn't believe the evidence was strong enough for him to do so. \n \n A lawsuit filed against Garnett in September 2013 led to the unsealing the following month of the 1999 indictments, confirming the child abuse charges as well as charges against both parents for accessory to first-degree murder. \n \n But still, the subsequent Lacy exoneration held sway for many, coming, as it did, nearly 10 years later, from the very same office that had secured those indictments. \n \n As recently as September, Wood, the lawyer for the Ramsey family, cited the DNA-based exoneration in a tweet in the wake of national television broadcasts that had raised anew the question of whether someone in JonBenet's family was involved in her murder. \n \n \"In 2008, Boulder DA publicly exonerated them and apologized. DNA evidence conclusive. End of story,\" Wood tweeted. \n \n And the same day, Wood tweeted, \" This is a DNA case plain and simple.\" \n \n That contention is flatly refuted by the independent experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS. \n \n \"No, it is not,\" Danielson said. \"It's clearly not. We have a questioned profile that is very low level in terms of the amount of DNA. The quantity of DNA is very small, the profile is extremely complex. The one thing this case is not, it is not a 'DNA case pure and simple.'\" \n \n McKee, at the University of Colorado, agreed. \n \n \"I don't think any case is just a DNA case. And laboratories across the country operate, and their analysts are trained, not to talk in terms like that,\" said McKee, emphasizing that genetic evidence should be considered an investigative thread that is part of a larger fabric to be considered in its entirety. \n \n \"I think it would be a big mistake to say that, you know, DNA is the only thing that you're going to look at,\" McKee said. \"And certainly, in this case, I don't think it is the only thing to look at.\" \n \n They were echoed by Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor. \n \n \"I would say that the DNA evidence is not conclusive,\" Thompson said. \"I would say that the DNA evidence is indeterminate, leaving us uncertain as to what really happened in this case, and who really killed this little girl.\" \n \n Thompson added, \"I mean, wasn't there other evidence in this case as well? I heard something about a ransom note, and handwriting analysis, and so on.\" \n \n Wood, in an interview, said his tweets were based on Lacy's official statements, and on comments by former Boulder police Chief Beckner, made in a Reddit conversation on Feb. 24, 2015. \n \n \"My statements are 100 percent supported by the public statements of the Boulder district attorney and the former Boulder police chief,\" Wood said. \"They're almost verbatim.\" \n \n But those waiting for nearly 13 years for a match in the CODIS database to the Unknown Male 1 profile could wait forever for something that is never going to happen, Danielson said. \n \n Although the unknown male sample had been entered into CODIS, it has never been matched to any of the other DNA profiles in the system. According to the FBI, as of August that included 12,517,059 offender profiles, 2,462,335 arrestee profiles and 726,709 forensic profiles of unknown individuals, such as the one submitted from the Ramsey case. \n \n One possible answer to the question of why a match has never occurred is that the profile is a composite containing genetic material from multiple people. \n \n \"As I looked at this case, the more I looked, I was just like, 'Oh, OK, that would explain why no database hits,'\" Danielson said. \n \n A call for new testing \n \n The JonBenet Ramsey investigation remains under the control of the Boulder Police Department, which has been in command of the case since Garnett passed it back to the department's detectives when he became DA in 2009. \n \n Revelations about the questioned value of the DNA evidence as it now stands is stirring calls for renewed action on the case. \n \n Owens hesitated to be telling others what should happen now, but said he was unsurprised to have his longtime suspicions that the DNA cited by Lacy could, in fact, be innocently explained \u2014 and may even be insignificant to the investigation \u2014 confirmed. \n \n \"And it would be very good to hear from Mary Lacy or from others involved, in terms of what this new evidence should show them in terms of where we should go,\" Owens said. \n \n Eid, his former chief counsel who was part of the governor's October 1999 case review, hopes it will prod new action in the investigation, possibly employing the latest in DNA technology, which has evolved by quantum leaps since Lacy's letter was issued. \n \n No new DNA testing in the Ramsey case has been conducted since 2008. \n \n \"And there ought to be a process to reevaluate this in light of what you have brought forward. That's my view,\" Eid said. \"And you shouldn't feel locked in because some person who is no longer an elected official made a decision and said something. How many people have said things about this case that turned out to not be very relevant, or very accurate?\" \n \n One important step in the evolution of DNA testing, which was available in 2008 but has matured considerably since then, is known as Y-STR testing, which looks exclusively at male-inherited Y chromosome DNA. \n \n Testing in this manner on key pieces of evidence, such as JonBenet's underwear, long johns and perhaps the cord on the garotte used to strangle her or other items associated with the crime scene, would not pick up any of JonBenet's genetic markers. That would enable analysts to focus with greater accuracy on only male contributors to the mixed samples. \n \n \"If you are able to ignore, completely, the female contribution, and can focus just on the male, you are able to then get much more robust results,\" McKee said. \"I don't really see a reason why it hasn't been done, or why you couldn't do it.\" \n \n Danielson agreed, saying, \"With the Y-STR testing, you eliminate all of the female DNA. So you can amplify male DNA, even if the male DNA is a fraction of 1 percent of the DNA of the females' on the samples. So that's, if I were going to do any additional testing, that's the additional testing that I would do. It would help to at least answer some of the questions.\" \n \n Grant, the former Adams County district attorney and one-time adviser to Boulder prosecutors, also pointed out that if Lacy truly had faith in the profile on which she based her exoneration, she could have done far more than simply write a letter. \n \n \"A prosecutor can file a John Doe warrant identifying the suspect by that DNA profile,\" Grant said. \"If then-District Attorney Lacy was convinced that that suspect, that DNA profile, was the killer, and she was going to exonerate somebody else, then that's what she should have done. \n \n \"The fact that she didn't do that tells me something \u2014 tells me something about how strong she thinks the DNA evidence may or may not be.\" \n \n Garnett expressed faith in the work of the Boulder Police Department, and also said his own office remains committed to doing whatever can be done to solve a case that he sees as still severely compromised by mistakes made in the past. \n \n \"I'm not going to talk publicly about what we're doing or what we would do,\" Garnett said. \"But what I can tell you is that DNA evidence and the theory behind DNA work is changing almost daily, and I have excellent people on staff who review those issues and handle that, and we will make sure that any appropriate testing that can be done to update the theories of the evidence is done.\" \n \n Garnett said Lacy's 2008 decision was \"legally insignificant\" and \"has no meaning,\" largely due to the fact that the evidence she cited in her letter was never subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and cross-examination that all evidence in any case goes through in a courtroom. \n \n \"None of that happened with the bits and pieces of evidence that was the basis of the exoneration,\" Garnett said. \"And so it's just not significant.\" \n \n Eid observed that \"it's incredible the number of cases that get solved later. And also as DNA testing gets better, it sometimes removes doubt and sometimes adds doubt.\" \n \n Eid remains convinced that, \"It's not too late for justice.\" \n \n Charlie Brennan: 303-473-1327, brennanc@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/chasbrennan \n \n Kevin Vaughan: 303-871-1862, kevin.vaughan@9news.com or twitter.com/writerkev ||||| Mary Lacy was one of a team of four who walked through the home of JonBenet Ramsey just days after the 6-year-old beauty contestant was discovered dead in the house's basement in Boulder, Colorado, on Dec. 26, 1996. \n \n Interested in Jon Benet Ramsey? Add Jon Benet Ramsey as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jon Benet Ramsey news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n Just around the corner from JonBenet's room on the second floor, an indentation in the carpet was spotted and chills ran down her spine, she told ABC News. \"It was a butt print. We all saw it. The entire area was undisturbed except for that place in the rug,\" Lacy, who was then the chief deputy district attorney heading up the Sexual Assault Unit under Boulder County DA Alex Hunter, said. \"Whoever did this sat outside of her room and waited until everyone was asleep to kill her.\" \n \n The apparent presence of that indentation went on to help form a theory that Lacy believes to this day. \n \n The morning after Christmas in 1996, JonBenet was reported missing by her parents after they said a ransom note was found in their home. Her body bound and her mouth covered with duct tape, JonBenet was later discovered in the basement. An autopsy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxiation due to strangulation. The coroner's report stated that a blunt object had hit her so hard, there was an 8-inch fracture to her tiny skull. The report also showed some damage to JonBenet's hymen, indicating possible sexual assault. \n \n John and Patsy Ramsey, as well as JonBenet's brother, Burke Ramsey, were the only other people known to be in the house at the time of the slaying, and for years after her death, they were each trailed by a cloud of suspicion. John and Patsy Ramsey were at one point considered persons of interest in the case by authorities. \n \n But in 2008, Lacy -- who by then had been named Boulder County DA and taken over the investigation -- surprised even some of the most seasoned of her fellow prosecutors by exonerating the family. \n \n Now, for the first time in eight years, the former prosecutor is speaking out to ABC News about her decision to clear the Ramsey family as her exoneration letter has now come under scrutiny following a joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and Denver's KUSA-TV/9News. \n \n Helen Davis/AP Photo \n \n 'Trying to Prevent a Horrible Travesty of Justice' \n \n Former Adams County DA Bob Grant, one of a number of consultants on the case brought in early on by the Boulder County DA at the time, Hunter, told ABC News he was confounded by Lacy's 2008 decision. \"This is craziness,\" he said. \"This is not what prosecutors do. If prosecutors are going to exonerate someone they do it by charging someone else.\" \n \n But Lacy didn't charge anyone else in the murder. Instead, armed with newly discovered DNA evidence found on JonBenet's long johns that Lacy said she believes belongs to JonBenet's unknown murderer, she sent the Ramseys a letter of apology. It read, in part, \"to the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry.\" The letter made international news. \n \n The DNA evidence was discovered after Lacy sent the long johns to Bode Cellmark Forensics to be tested for touch DNA. She had attended a seminar in the summer of 2007 that explained the relatively new process. She felt it could advance the seemingly stalled case, she said. \n \n Some Boulder Police Department detectives who had long worked on the investigation and still considered the Ramseys persons of interests were furious. \n \n \"Here\u2019s what I was doing with the exoneration letter,\" Lacy explained. \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice. I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.\" \n \n In the 2008 letter, Lacy hung her hat on newly discovered touch DNA found on JonBenet's long johns, which she said was found to belong to an unknown male. Lacy argued that this unknown male DNA matched DNA found in two spots of blood in the crotch of JonBenet's panties. The unknown male DNA, reasoned Lacy, was the smoking gun that pointed to JonBenet's killer and that killer was not anyone in her family. Family members and 200 other potential suspects were excluded from the unknown male DNA found on the panties and long johns, she said. \n \n Lacy's theory? When the Ramseys left to have Christmas night dinner with friends, they left the front door unlocked, and a male intruder simply walked inside and waited for hours for the family to come home. During that time, Lacy believes, he wrote the rambling two-and-a-half page ransom note. \n \n That note referenced several lines from movies. \"The Boulder police should have checked all of the video stores to see who was renting those movies and they never did,\" said Lacy. \n \n However, the Boulder Daily Camera's investigation published Thursday found the DNA results in the Bode report are not necessarily as clear cut as Lacy concluded they were. According to the Daily Camera, they showed the Bode report to independent experts who say that the DNA samples from both the underwear and long johns may be composite samples from multiple people: JonBenet, an unknown male and, in one sample, a third unidentified person. To the extent composites were used in the search to identify the killer, the investigation states that the DNA profile \"may be worthless as evidence.\" According to the paper, the possible presence of a third individual's DNA on the long johns has never been publicly revealed. \n \n The experts also stated that the presence of the DNA on JonBenet's undergarments could have an innocent explanation because the \"profiles were developed from minute samples that could have been the result of inconsequential contact with other people or transferred from another piece of clothing.\" \n \n According to the paper, these opinions \"cut both ways\" on the competing theories of the case. They neither disprove the intruder theory nor \"implicate or exonerate anyone in the family.\" \n \n When asked about the impending Daily Camera report ahead of its publication Thursday, Lacy said she has taken criticism for her decision to write the exoneration letter in the past. \"I've withstood worse than this,\" she said. \"And it's nothing compared to what the Ramsey family has gone through targeted as suspects in their own daughter's murder.\" Lacy has not responded to ABC News' request for comment since the Daily Camera report was published. \n \n Is JonBenet's Murder a DNA Case or Not? \n \n There have been conflicting views over whether the mystery of JonBenet's murder can be solved by DNA alone. \n \n Former Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner, who headed up the department from 1998 to 2014, said in an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit last year that the investigation considered the DNA important, but that there was other crucial evidence in the case that couldn't be ignored. \n \n \"Mary Lacy, the DA who said the DNA exonerated them, made up her mind years before that a mother could not do that to a child, thus the family was innocent,\" Beckner wrote. \n \n Stan Garnett, the current Boulder County DA, told ABC News that no case is ever solely reliant on DNA. \"DNA is a part of the case,\" he said. \"But you have to account for everything else. There were problems with crime scene, you have the ransom note ... you have debates about the cause of death -- to solve this case we have to account for all of that.\" \n \n But forensic pathologist Lawrence Kobilinsky with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who has not worked on the case but who reviewed a summary of the Bode report put together by Boulder County investigator Andy Horita prior to the publication of the Daily Camera report, told ABC News that ignoring the unknown male DNA would be a huge mistake. \"This is definitely a DNA case,\" he said. Kobilinsky said the markers found on the long johns are not enough of a profile to \"match\" those found in the panties, as Lacy wrote in her letter exonerating the Ramseys, but he would describe the markers from both the long johns and the panties as being \"consistent\" and noted that the DNA does belong to an unknown male. \"Lacy did the right thing [in clearing the Ramsey family],\" he said. \n \n When questioned about hanging her hat on the DNA in her exoneration letter, Lacy said that she only did that because the DNA was \"something tangible people could understand.\" The truth is, she said, she cleared the Ramseys not just based on the DNA, but also from looking at the totality of the evidence. \n \n \"There was no motive [for the parents], and no psychopathy,\" Lacy said. She added that she is one of only two people who have read the entire transcripts of Patsy Ramsey's psychiatric interviews, in which Lacy said she saw no indication of jealousy toward JonBenet or any violent tendencies. In 2006 when Patsy Ramsey was dying of cancer and even on her deathbed, Lacy said the distraught mother was trying to solve the death of her daughter. \n \n Lacy, who was the Boulder County DA from 2001 until 2009, said the Boulder police investigation had ignored important evidence that pointed away from the Ramseys and instead focused on them while \"trying to get the death penalty.\" \n \n \"They were running around the country looking for something negative on that family,\" Lacy said. But the Ramseys, she said, were clean. \n \n The case is currently cold, but Boulder police say they are continuing to investigate any lead that comes in. It's recently attracted new attention this fall as the 20th anniversary of JonBenet's death approaches, and police have received hundreds of new tips. \n \n Ed Andrieski-Pool/Getty Images \n \n A Lacy 'Apology Tour' \n \n People who worked with Lacy remember her bringing John Ramsey into the Boulder County prosecutor's office around the time she exonerated the family. \"She wanted us all to shake hands with him. We didn't know what to say ... it was like an apology tour,\" said one of Lacy's former DA investigators, Gordon Coombes. \n \n Coombes, who worked in the Boulder prosecutor's office from 2008 to 2011, said he feels Lacy got too close to the family and lost her objectivity. \"It was understood that if you didn't fall in line with the intruder theory, you were out,\" he said. \n \n Another investigator who worked under Lacy, Ruth Aten-Shearwood, who is now a social worker in England, said that apart from a tight network of advisers, Lacy did not allow other investigators to work on the Ramsey case. Aten-Shearwood said she found out about the exoneration letter from watching the news. Said Aten-Shearwood, \"I had to pick my jaw up off the floor.\" \n \n Garnett, the current Boulder County DA, is running unopposed for his third term. Of Lacy's exoneration letter, he said, \"This letter is not legally binding. It's a good-faith opinion and has no legal importance but the opinion of the person who had the job before I did, whom I respect.\" \n \n When asked about the Ramseys, he said, \"They, like everyone else, are presumed innocent. There's not enough admissible evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to charge anyone with this crime.\" \n \n The Ramseys have always maintained their innocence. Burke Ramsey, now 29, recently filed a $150 million defamation suit against a forensic pathologist who claimed he was involved in the murder on CBS\u2019 \"The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey.\" Burke's attorney, Lin Wood, told ABC News that Burke was falsely accused of being responsible for the death of his sister. \n \n Wood told ABC News he has tremendous respect for Lacy and the work she did during her time as DA. \"This was a one-side, unfounded and brutal attack on Lacy who served well the citizens of Boulder for eight years,\" he said of the Daily Camera report. \n \n Later, he added that he is encouraged that the DNA is being called into question because \"now maybe all of those other suspects who were excluded will have to be reinvestigated.\" \n \n Lacy told ABC News she stands by her decision to exonerate the Ramseys, insisting that \"if the evidence had been there [to prosecute them], I'd have gone for it.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever\u2014especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence. A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) \"I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.\" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects.

Her baby girl was born without a brain. \n \n \"No one can say how long she will live,\" Morena Herrera of the Feminist Collective for Local Development told The Associated Press. \"It was painful to see the little creature. That's what the grandmother told us, and the doctors confirmed it.\" \n \n The country's Supreme Court last week prohibited an abortion for Beatriz, who suffers from lupus and kidney failure and whose lawyers said the pregnancy was threatening her life. Her plight drew international attention and a ruling from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights that El Salvador should protect her life and help her end the pregnancy. \n \n The Health Ministry stepped in late last week after the ruling and said it would allow the C-section because the pregnancy was already at 26 weeks and the country's strict abortion laws were no longer at play. Ultrasound images had indicated her fetus was developing with only a brain stem. \n \n The Health Ministry can determine what is most medically sound for a mother versus the unborn baby and was lauded internationally for working to save the woman's life. \n \n Doctors at the Maternity Hospital had been preparing to perform the C-section at the slightest danger signs to save Beatriz's life, said Maria Isabel Rodriguez of the health ministry. \n \n The woman was recovering under the close watch of doctors late Monday. \n \n El Salvador's laws prohibit all abortions, even when a woman's health is at risk. Beatriz and any doctor who terminated her pregnancy would have faced arrest and criminal charges. \n \n A majority of judges on the high court rejected the appeal by Beatriz's lawyers, saying physical and psychological exams by the government-run Institute of Legal Medicine found that her diseases were under control and that she could continue the pregnancy. \n \n Just as the Health Ministry was resolving the case, the Inter-American Court issued its ruling, but it no longer applied in the case. \n \n Abortion opponents said the case was being used to press for legalized abortion in El Salvador, which has some of the toughest abortion laws in Latin America, along with Chile, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Suriname. ||||| SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The pregnant woman at the centre of an abortion controversy in El Salvador had her malformed foetus delivered on Monday by Caesarean section to save her life and avoid breaking the law, although the baby did not survive. \n \n El Salvador's Health Ministry said doctors attending the woman, who uses the name \"Beatriz\" to protect her identity, performed a Caesarean to remove the foetus, thereby avoiding an abortion, which is illegal in the country. \n \n The Central American country banned all types of abortion in 1999, but Beatriz's foetus had a serious condition known as anencephaly, which results in only partial brain development. Such a foetus has little or no chance of surviving after birth. \n \n Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez said the operation took place about 2 p.m. (2000 GMT) and that Beatriz, who had been 27 weeks pregnant, was in stable condition. \n \n \"She's in good hands, being looked after well,\" she told Reuters. \"I expect things to go well over the next few hours.\" \n \n Shortly afterward, Rodriguez said that Beatriz's baby daughter died about five hours after the operation. \n \n Beatriz, 22, suffers from lupus and kidney problems, which posed a serious threat to her own health. \n \n The operation followed a non-binding resolution on Thursday by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that called on El Salvador to take action to save Beatriz's life after the country's courts had denied her an abortion. \n \n El Salvador's Supreme Court rejected Beatriz's request for an abortion on the grounds it breached the constitution, which it said protects life from the moment of conception. \n \n The Caesarean delivery provided El Salvador with a way out of the legal wrangle. \n \n Morena Herrera, a spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Colectivo Feminista, said that although Beatriz could have been spared unnecessary suffering, her life had been saved. \n \n Claudia Handal, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group Red Familia, said the rights of all had been respected. \n \n \"We're very happy because as we said from the beginning, it wasn't necessary to perform an abortion, the point was to respect the baby's life and to give Beatriz the care and the right to health that she deserved,\" Handal told Reuters. \n \n The case has drawn attention to abortion in El Salvador and attitudes toward the procedure in predominantly Roman Catholic Latin America. Some countries such as Colombia are relaxing their rules in order to permit abortions in cases of rape. \n \n (Editing by Dave Graham and Peter Cooney) ||||| A seriously ill woman denied a medical abortion has had a caesarean section to save her life and avoid breaking the law, although the baby did not survive, El Salvador's health ministry announced late on Monday. \n \n The 22-year-old woman, known only as Beatriz for privacy reasons, underwent the operation in the afternoon after 27 weeks of pregnancy, the ministry said.

    "document": "For years, scores of teenage boys across the Midwest couldn't put a face or a name to the source of their torment: a man who distributed their nude images across the internet and even goaded some into sexual activity. \n \n But on Tuesday, two of the young men sat in a federal courtroom in St. Paul as Anton Martynenko was sentenced to 38 years in prison for running a massive sextortion scheme described as the largest child porn production case ever prosecuted in Minnesota. \n \n \"We all can now be given freedom from this,\" said one victim, identified in court only as Grant, after the sentence came down. \n \n Martynenko, 32, of Eagan, pleaded guilty in January for his role in a scheme prosecutors said victimized more than 155 boys \u2014 mostly high school athletes between 14 and 16 \u2014 by using fake social media profiles, often posing as young women, to persuade them to send him nude photos and videos, which he later would post online. \n \n In passing sentence, U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle gave Martynenko two years' credit for his assistance to investigators on the Jacob Wetterling case. Martynenko shared information he picked up from suspect Danny Heinrich while the two were jail cellmates. \n \n Martynenko scoured high school sports websites for the names of teenage boys, then tricked them into swapping sexually explicit photos and videos. \n \n Some victims believed they were exchanging flirtatious messages with attractive young women, who actually were invented by Martynenko on one of the several \"decoy\" social media accounts he created. Other times, he hid behind social media profiles meant to look like a local high school hockey player and offered to pay victims to allow him to perform oral sex on them. \n \n Once Martynenko obtained the images, he threatened to post them online \u2014 and often did \u2014 and shared them with dozens of classmates as a way of pressuring and embarrassing his victims. \n \n Assistant U.S. Attorney Carol Kayser called Martynenko a \"tenacious predator\" who persisted in his four-year scheme even after interacting with local and federal law enforcement agencies. \n \n Prosecutors said Martynenko lured at least three boys into performing sex acts on him, and that two of his victims later committed suicide. \n \n \"We don't know what role his scheme had [in their deaths] but you can certainly imagine the depression and stress this added to their lives,\" Kayser said. \n \n Other victims like Roy, now 21 years old, spoke in court Tuesday. They said they also considered suicide as a result of \"crippling anxiety\" from having nude images posted across social media for friends, family and employers to see. \n \n \"My life has become a living hell,\" said Roy, who was 17 when Martynenko first messaged him. \n \n Target lists \n \n Grant was 15 when Martynenko reached out to him in 2012 purporting to be Cortney Jansgen, an attractive young manager of a modeling agency who pitched Grant on a $1,000 modeling gig. But first, Grant said, he had to share nude photos for a sample portfolio. Those images later circulated online after Grant turned down a request from another Martynenko account offering $300 for oral sex. \n \n The images \"spread like wildfire,\" Grant said, and he later spent sleepless nights trying to keep up with the latest social media alerts notifying that he had been tagged in another photo. Martynenko, Grant said, \"was a terrible human being who spent years of his life making hundreds of teen boys miserable.\" \n \n \"It's an honor to be able to be here to speak for them,\" Grant later said of the many other victims who couldn't attend Tuesday's hearing. \"I'm now going to enjoy my time without any fear of another attack. It's good to know that he's going to be unable to do that to us anymore.\" \n \n Investigators from suburban police departments that also worked the case attended Tuesday's hearing, which spanned several hours. \n \n The investigation began with a call from a Rosemount teenager to local police and eventually expanded to include the FBI. Martynenko was arrested in November 2015, minutes after sending his final Twitter message to a Minneapolis officer who was granted permission to operate a teen victim's account undercover. \n \n Authorities eventually unspooled detailed \"target lists\" of teenage boys that Martynenko sought to contact. In court Tuesday, Kayser showed the judge one list and a screenshot of some of the meticulous folders of boys' photos that Martynenko organized by name, age, school and occasionally penis size. \n \n In an interview after Martynenko's sentencing, U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger underscored the importance of using the internet safely. \n \n \"One of the things that keeps me up at night are the actions of a man like Anton Martynenko,\" Luger said. \"This case highlighted how deeply disturbing the criminal obsession of a man like Martynenko can be. How not only does he steal the innocence of teenage boys but through extortion, threats and physical acts he inflicted unspeakable psychological damage to his victims.\" \n \n A forensic psychologist who examined Martynenko testified Tuesday that he appeared amenable to intensive psychosexual treatment for addiction to pornography and other mental health problems. But he voiced concern at nearly 200 pages of chat logs between Martynenko and victims in which he expressed delight at \"exposing\" victims' nude photos. \n \n His mother, Natalie Martynenko, who also addressed the judge during the hearing, embraced emotional relatives and supporters after hearing her son's sentence. She acknowledged that her son's crimes were serious, and said she had hoped for a sentence heavier on treatment than it was on incarceration. \n \n \"He's my only child,\" she said in the courthouse lobby. \n \n A tearful Martynenko meanwhile apologized to victims in court, calling his own actions \"disgusting,\" but arguing that he is \"not an evil person trying to ruin lives.\" \n \n He described his online activities as a \"getaway\" from anxiety and depression but \"I literally couldn't have handled myself any worse than I did.\" \n \n \"I have to pay for what I've done,\" Martynenko said. \"I'll do anything the rest of my life to make it up.\" \n \n Kayser argued that Martynenko still failed to take full responsibility for his actions, including denying sexual activity with a third victim and maintaining he did not post some of the messages. \n \n Marsh Halberg, an attorney for Martynenko, sought the mandatory minimum of 15 years for the three child pornography charges to which his client pleaded guilty. He argued that 40 years was essentially a life sentence. \n \n \"This will always follow him no matter what he does,\" Halberg said. \n \n Twitter: @smontemayor ||||| Anton Martynenko | Anoka County Jail \n \n - A 32-year-old man from Eagan, Minnesota was sentenced to 38 years in prison Tuesday for using social media to obtain child pornography from more than 155 high school boys in multiple states. Prosecutors sought a 40-year prison sentence for Anton Martynenko, but two years were shaved off his sentence for giving federal investigators notes on jail conversations he had with Danny Heinrich, the man who killed Jacob Wetterling. \n \n Sextortion case \n \n According to court documents, Martynenko \u201cregularly scoured internet sites devoted to high school athletes to locate his targets.\u201d In many cases, he posed as a teenage girl to solicit nude photos from the boys, which he then posted on social media. \n \n Prosecutors say Martynenko collected child pornography, but also \u201cdelighted in the humiliation, embarrassment, and potential negative consequences his actions caused his victims.\u201d \n \n Prosecutors are aware of three boys who engaged in sexual activity with Martynenko, which he claims were consensual encounters. At least two of Martynenko\u2019s victims committed suicide, but it is not known what role, if any, his scheme had in their deaths. \n \n Martynenko pleaded guilty in January. Prosecutors said this is the single largest child pornography production case in Minnesota history. \n \n \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve been given freedom today,\u201d one of Martynenko\u2019s victims said at Tuesday\u2019s sentencing. \u201cIt\u2019s very satisfying to see this man sit in prison for the rest of his life.\u201d \n \n Wetterling case connection \n \n According to a pre-sentencing filing, Martynenko informed his attorneys of conversations he had with Danny Heinrich, during his time at the Sherburne County Jail. Martynenko \u201cfelt it was his moral duty to convey the information he had obtained from Mr. Heinrich relating to both Jacob Wetterling\u2019s murder as well as the sexual assault of Jared Scheierl.\u201d \n \n Martynenko met with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office on Aug. 17 and provided 40 pages of notes on the conversations he had with Danny Heinrich. Six days later, Martynenko met with his attorney and said Heinrich had returned from a meeting with his own lawyers and was bragging to everyone that he was \u201cgoing to be very famous in the coming weeks and to be sure to watch for him on television.\u201d \n \n Heinrich later told Martynenko, \u201cin great detail,\u201d how he abducted, sexually assaulted and killed Jacob Wetterling. \n \n \u201cDid he help solve the Heinrich-Wetterling case? He did not,\u201d said assistant U.S. attorney Carol Kayser. \u201cHe wanted to be painted as a hero. And he is not.\u201d",

All told, he tricked more than 155 boys, mainly between 14 and 16, in multiple states, KMSP reports. Martynenko, who pleaded guilty in January, \"delighted in the humiliation, embarrassment, and potential negative consequences his actions caused his victims,\" prosecutors said, per court docs. Once Martynenko had the boys' photos, he'd threaten to post the pics online, and he'd often follow through. He also managed to persuade three boys into committing sexual acts on him, and two of his victims ended up killing themselves. One of the victims who appeared in court, now 21, said \"my life has become a living hell\" from the experience, while the other, who's around 19, noted Martynenko was \"a terrible human being who spent years of his life making hundreds of teen boys miserable.\" Side note: Martynenko had two years lopped off his sentence for helping investigators on the Jacob Wetterling case. He'd shared a jail cell with Danny Heinrich, Jacob's killer, at one point and had apparently procured information. (The break in the Wetterling case came in September after 27 years.)",

One of Martynenko's victims called him a \"terrible human being\" who \"spent years of his life making hundreds of teen boys miserable.\" \"I'm now going to enjoy my time without any fear of another attack,\" the victim said. \"It's good to know that he's going to be unable to do that to us anymore \u2013 \"He's my only child,\" said Natalie Martynenko of her son, Anton, after he was sentenced to 40 years in prison on child pornography charges Tuesday in a Minnesota courtroom. Anton Martynenko, a 31-year-old from St. Paul, Minn., was arrested in November 2015 after sending his final tweet to an undercover Minneapolis police officer posing as a teen victim. Authorities say he threatened to send nude photos of teen boys if they didn't send him more, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. Police say he also threatened to show his victims' genitals to their parents. In court Tuesday, the judge heard testimony from one of Martynenko's teenage victims, who described being blackmailed by Martynenko. \"I'm now going to enjoy my time without any fear of another attack,\" the teen said. \"It's good to know that he's going to be unable to do that to us anymore.\" Martynenko apologized in court for his \"disgusting\" actions but said he was \"not an evil person trying to ruin lives.\" His attorney, however, said his client appeared to be taking part in psychosexual treatment. \"This will always follow him no matter what he does,\" the attorney said. Martyn \u2013 \"We feel like we've been given freedom today,\" says one of Anton Martynenko's victims. \"It's very satisfying to see this man sit in prison for the rest of his life.\" The 32-year-old Minnesota man was on Tuesday sentenced to 38 years in prison in what prosecutors say is the largest child pornography production case in Minnesota history, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. According to the AP, Martynenko posed as a teen girl on social media to solicit nude photos from more than 155 high school boys in multiple states. Prosecutors say he shared the photos with at least three of his victims, who then engaged in sexual activity with him. At least two of the boys Martynenko is believed to have had sex with committed suicide, though it's not clear if his scheme had a role in their deaths. In court documents, prosecutors said Martynenko \"delighted in the humiliation, embarrassment, and potential negative consequences his actions caused his victims.\" At Tuesday's sentencing, a federal judge shaved two years off the 40-year sentence prosecutors had sought for Martynenko, who used \"internet sites devoted to high school athletes to locate his targets,\" per the Star Tribune. The judge also ordered Martynenko to register as a sex offender",

    "document": "Morley Safer CBS News \n \n Morley Safer, the CBS newsman who changed war reporting forever when he showed U.S. Marines burning the huts of Vietnamese villagers and went on to become the iconic 60 Minutes correspondent whose stylish stories on America's most-watched news program made him one of television's most enduring stars, died today in Manhattan. He was 84. He had homes in Manhattan and Chester, Conn. \n \n Safer was in declining health when he announced his retirement last week; CBS News broadcast a long-planned special hour to honor the occasion on Sunday May 15 that he watched in his home. \n \n A huge presence on 60 Minutes for 46 years -- Safer enjoyed the longest run anyone ever had on primetime network television. Though he cut back a decade ago, he still appeared regularly until recently, captivating audiences with his signature stories on art, science and culture. A dashing figure in his checked shirt, polka dot tie and pocket square, Morley Safer -- even his name had panache -- was in his true element playing pool with Jackie Gleason, delivering one of his elegant essays aboard the Orient Express or riffing on Anna Wintour, but he also asked the tough questions and did the big stories. In 2011, over 18.5 million people watched him ask Ruth Madoff how she could not have known her husband Bernard was running a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. The interview was headline news and water cooler talk for days. \n \n \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways.\" \n \n In some of his later 60 Minutes pieces, Safer profiled the cartoonists of The New Yorker, interviewed the founder and staff of Wikipedia and reported on a billion-dollar art trove discovered in a Munich apartment. In his last story broadcast on March 13, he profiled the visionary architect Bjarke Ingels. \n \n \"Morley was one of the most important journalists in any medium, ever,\" said CBS Chairman and CEO, Leslie Moonves. \"He broke ground in war reporting and made a name that will forever be synonymous with 60 Minutes. He was also a gentleman, a scholar, a great raconteur - all of those things and much more to generations of colleagues, his legion of friends, and his family, to whom all of us at CBS offer our sincerest condolences over the loss of one of CBS' and journalism's greatest treasures.\" \n \n \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways. He was a master storyteller, a gentleman and a wonderful friend. We will miss him very much,\" said Jeff Fager, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and Safer's close friend and one-time 60 Minutes producer. \n \n CBS News President David Rhodes said, \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture. His writing alone defined original reporting. Everyone at CBS News will sorely miss Morley.\" \n \n Safer was a familiar reporter to millions when he replaced Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes in 1970. A much-honored foreign correspondent, Safer was the first U.S. network newsman to film a report inside Communist China. He appeared regularly on the CBS Evening News from all over the world, especially Vietnam, where his controversial reporting earned him peer praise and government condemnation. \n \n \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture.\" \n \n Safer's piece from the Vietnamese hamlet of Cam Ne in August of 1965 showing U.S. Marines burning the villagers' thatched huts was cited by New York University as one of the 20th century's best pieces of American journalism. Some believe this report freed other journalists to stop censoring themselves and tell the raw truth about war. The controversial report on the \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\" earned Safer a George Polk award and angered President Lyndon Johnson so much, he reportedly called CBS President Frank Stanton and said, \"Your boys shat on the American flag yesterday.\" Some Marines are said to have threatened Safer, but others thanked him for exposing a cruel tactic. Safer said that the pentagon treated him with contempt for the rest of his life. \n \n He spent three tours (1964-'66) as head of the CBS Saigon bureau. His helicopter was shot down in a 1965 battle, after which Safer continued to report under fire. In 1990, he penned a memoir of his Vietnam experience, \"Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam\" (Random House), in which he goes back to reminisce and to interview the enemy's veterans. \n \n When he joined Mike Wallace at the beginning of 60 Minutes' third season, they toiled to put stories on the air for a program that dodged cancellation each season. But their work was immediately recognized with an Emmy for Safer's 1971 investigation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began America's war in Vietnam. The two pressed on for five years, moving the broadcast from the bottom fourth to the middle of the rankings. Then in August 1975, with a new Sunday evening timeslot, Safer put 60 Minutes on the national stage. Interviewing Betty Ford, the first lady shocked many Americans by saying she would think it normal if her 18-year-old daughter were having sex. The historic sit-down also included frank talk about pot and abortion. \n \n By 1978, the broadcast was in Nielsen's Top 10. Safer's eloquent, sometimes quirky features balanced out the program's \"gotcha\" interviews and investigations, perfecting the news magazine's recipe. It became the number-one program for the 1979-'80 season - a crown it won five times. 60 Minutes remained in the top 10 for an unprecedented 23 straight seasons. \n \n It was another Safer story that would become one of the program's most honored and important. \"Lenell Geter's in Jail,\" about a young black man serving life for armed robbery in Texas, overturned Geter's conviction 10 days after the December 1983 segment exposed a sloppy rush to injustice. Safer and 60 Minutes were honored with the industry's highest accolades: the Peabody, Emmy and duPont-Columbia University awards. 60 Minutes founder Don Hewitt often pointed to the story as the program's finest work. \n \n Morley Safer's Pick: Lenell Geter's in Jail \n \n Safer hit more journalistic home runs, but sought out the odd stories that piqued his curiosity. The offbeat tales were more suited to his raconteur style and cultural sensibility. He found esoteric subjects all over the world and here in the U.S., ranging from a tiny Pacific island nation economically dependent on guano to the strange choice of tango dancing as a national hobby for the shy people of Finland to the strange yet harmonious stew of cowboys and artists in the Texas town of Marfa -- all narrated in his drolly delivered and precise prose. His conversational wit with his subjects was just as sharp as his written word. In a profile of the prim Martha Stewart, a smirking Safer passed her livestock pen and said to the domestic diva, \"Your barnyard? It's remarkably odor-free.\" \n \n Some of these features had national impact, however, like his November 1991 report, \"The French Paradox,\" which connected red wine consumption to lower incidents of heart disease among the free-eating French. Wine merchants say this report was single-handedly responsible for starting the red wine boom in America. His 1993 segment \"Yes, But is it Art?\" enraged the modern art community when it criticized expensive, contemporary installations featuring household items like toilets and vacuums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City may have held a grudge; years later, it refused to allow Safer onto its premises to review a Jackson Pollock retrospective for CBS Sunday Morning. \n \n Safer's life was a work of art into which 60 Minutes fit seamlessly. He vacationed in Europe, often combining field trips for his stories. He made a regular pilgrimage to The American Academy in Rome to hone his painting skills, a hobby he began from an early age. He mounted a small exhibition of his paintings in 1985. He also had a special affinity for cars and did 60 Minutes segments on England's Rolls Royce and Italy's legendary Lamborghini. He owned a silver 1985 Ferrari convertible, which he had raced occasionally and also owned a Bentley when he lived in London, bought with his winnings from a card game. \n \n Other highlights from Safer's 60 Minutes work include a poignant segment in 1978 called \"The Music of Auschwitz,\" about an inmate who played in an orchestra to avoid the Nazi gas chambers; his 1979 profile of Katharine Hepburn; \"The Beeb,\" a 1985 Emmy-winning take on BBC Radio; \"The Enemy,\" the 1989 story for which Safer returned to Vietnam; and in 1979, \"Marva,\" about Chicago teacher Marva Collins, whose alternative school for disadvantaged kids proved such students could excel. Safer's follow-up on \"Marva\" in 1996, in which he debunked a subsequent book that claimed Collins' students would not succeed in the long run, earned him his fourth duPont-Columbia University award. \n \n In addition to the four duPonts, Safer won every major award, including the Paul White Award from the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1966 when he was only 35 -- an award usually given for lifetime achievement. The other awards given to Safer over his long career include three Peabody awards, three Overseas Press Club awards, two George Polk Memorial awards, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism first prize for domestic television, the Fred Friendly First Amendment award, 12 Emmys and a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Government. \n \n CBS News hired the Canadian-born Safer in 1964 in London, where he was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He got the job in an odd turn of events. One of Safer's CBC colleagues seeking a job with CBS sent a demo tape of a roundtable he anchored that included Safer. CBS news executives liked Safer better and gave him a job in the London Bureau. The young correspondent took over his new job behind the desk once occupied by another CBS legend, the late Edward R. Murrow. After a year, he was asked to open the Saigon Bureau to report on the simmering conflict in Vietnam. He was then named bureau chief in London in 1967 and reported on a variety of foreign stories beyond Britain, many of them risky assignments, including the Nigerian-Biafran War, the Middle East conflict and the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. \n \n During this period he also filmed the historic CBS News Special Report \"Morley Safer's Red China Diary\" (August 1967), the first broadcast by a U.S. network news team from inside Communist China. Safer's Canadian citizenship helped get him into the country posing as a tourist interested in archeology. He and his cameraman, John Peters, were able to film the everyday lives of Chinese with a home movie camera. In a close call, suspicious authorities took Safer and Peters to meet an archeologist, who tested his knowledge. Safer knew enough about China's archeological periods to avoid arrest. \n \n Safer's reporting and writing also appeared on the CBS News documentary series, \"CBS Reports.\" He had a regular feature on CBS Radio, \"Morley Safer's Journal,\" that ran in 1970s. In May 1994, he hosted \"One for the Road: A Conversation with Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer,\" a CBS News special marking Kuralt's retirement. \n \n Safer was born Nov. 8, 1931 in Toronto and eventually became an American citizen, holding a dual citizenship. Telling MacLeans he felt \"stateless,\" he believed this status was an advantage. \"I bring a different perspective and I have no vested interests,\" he told the magazine in 1998. \n \n Growing up, he was influenced by the writing of Ernest Hemingway and decided he would be a foreign correspondent. He attended the University of Western Ontario for only a few weeks when he dropped out to begin writing for newspapers. He first wrote for the rural Woodstock Sentinel-Review before landing a job with the much larger London (Ontario) Free-Press. He then went on to England with the help of the Commonwealth Press Union, which promised to place him in a job there. After a short stint on the Oxford Mail and Times, Reuters hired Safer in London in 1955. When he returned late that year, he found work as an editor and reporter in the Toronto headquarters of the CBC. He was chosen to produce \"CBC News Magazine\" in 1956, on which he also occasionally appeared . His first on-camera work was on assignment for the CBC covering the Suez Crisis in November 1956. \n \n The CBC sent him back to London in 1961, from which he covered major stories in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, including the war for Algerian Independence, until he joined CBS. He was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin the night the Communists began building the Berlin Wall in August 1961. \n \n Safer was asked to characterize his legacy as a journalist in a November 2000 interview with the American Archive of Television. \"I have a pretty solid body of work that emphasized the words, emphasized ideas and the craft of writing for this medium. It's not literary, I wouldn't presume to suggest that. But I think you can elevate it a little bit sometimes with the most important part of the medium, which is what people are saying -- whether they're the people being interviewed or the guy who's telling the story. It's not literature, but it can be very classy journalism.\" \n \n He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jane, one daughter, Sarah Bakal, her husband, Alexander Bakal, three grandchildren, a sister, and brother, both of Toronto. \n \n Funeral arrangements are private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. ||||| Morley Safer, 60 Minutes' longest-serving correspondent, died this week at age 84. Last week, the broadcast aired a tribute in honor of his retirement after 46 years on the broadcast. \n \n To celebrate Safer's remarkable tenure, executive producer Jeff Fager called on an in-house dream team -- editor Warren Lustig and producers David Browning, Katy Textor and Michelle St. John -- to create the tribute that aired Sunday night. \n \n But how do you condense five decades -- that included more than 900 stories -- into a one-hour broadcast? That was the enormous challenge they faced. \n \n \"In the simplest terms, we set out to capture Morley,\" says Browning, Safer's longtime producer, in the 60 Minutes Overtime video above. \"You want to make sure that what you're showing is representative of his work and the great variety of work that he's done.\" \n \n That work included a groundbreaking 1965 CBS News report from Cam Ne, Vietnam, where Safer showed U.S. Marines torching villagers' huts, and a 60 Minutes story on Lenell Geter, a black man in Texas wrongly accused of armed robbery and later exonerated as a result of Safer's report. \n \n There were countless stories, on every imaginable topic, each tale uniquely his own. \"They were works of art almost,\" Fager explains. \"What makes a story a Morley story is his original voice. And by that I mean not just the timbre, but [also] the quality of the storytelling, his writing.\" \n \n Fager recalls working as Safer's producer and bringing him the first draft of a script. Safer would look at it, stare out the window for a few seconds, and then quickly scroll a piece of paper into his trusty typewriter and rework it to his own satisfaction. Textor showed Overtime one of her scripts with a yellow piece of paper taped on where Safer had added his own better-written line. \n \n \"He simply had this ability to take it to the next level,\" Browning explains. \"There's an old saying of Mark Twain's that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. And that's what Morley did. He was lightning.\" \n \n While Safer claims his stories were aimed more at the ear than the eye, Fager says the correspondent's genius was his ability to link the two. \"You see lines. You hear lines. You experience while you're watching a connection with his writing to the picture,\" he says. \n \n \n \n Safer didn't take himself too seriously, his colleagues say, and liked to entertain his viewers. \"Morley's advice was always: if you can get them to laugh, you're home free,\" recalls Textor. \"He knew that if he could get a chuckle, you were pretty good. You were going to be okay.\" \n \n He also had an eye for the absurd. An amateur artist in his spare time, Safer got a kick out of ridiculing pretentiousness in the art world, even if it meant gently mocking collectors as they showed him around. \"Morley has always had a great sense of smoking out phonies and smoking out phony stories and things that just aren't right,\" Browing says. \n \n Some of Safer's most memorable pieces were offbeat - or downright bizarre: A story on the popularity of tango in Finland, for instance, or a tale of crime and punishment on Furudu, a tiny island in the Maldives. \n \n \"Morley discovered [that] a story could be essentially what you made it to be,\" says Browning. \"If you found an interesting place to go and an interesting cast of characters, it really didn't matter if there was a huge headline there. As we say in the broadcast, the journey was really the story.\" \n \n It was a journey Safer enjoyed immensely. \"I've led a charmed life,\" he said in an interview. \"I mean, in every respect, I've led a charmed life as a reporter, as an individual. A lot of it is, as I said, blood, sweat, toil, and tears, but a lot of it is pure, unadulterated luck, and I've been a very lucky guy.\" \n \n Photos courtesy of CBS News, CBS Photo Archive and Morley Safer \n \n The video above was produced by Lisa Orlando, and edited by Lisa Orlando and Will Croxton.",

Atkins, a former first responder, also contracted a flesh-eating bacterial infection but survived, according to CNN affiliate KTRK . He had been kayaking through floodwaters to check on neighbors affected by the hurricane, according to a Facebook post in September \n \n \"We're surprised we saw three of them in the region, but given the exposure to all the construction and potential injuries that people would have ... it shouldn't be surprising. It's well within what we would expect given those numbers,\" said Dr. Philip Keiser, the Galveston County local health authority. \n \n Yet such infections as necrotizing fasciitis are very rare, Keiser said.

Such an infection can spread quickly and kills the body's soft tissue, especially if it infects a wound that is not properly cared for, Keiser said. The infection also can become lethal within a short amount of time. \n \n \"What happens is, you get some kind of break in the skin, and in that area -- between the skin and the muscle -- it's a fairly open space where the bacteria can grow,\" Keiser said. \n \n \"I have seen these things spread over hours. Even in one case, as I was examining a patient, I could see the red spread in the minutes I was examining him, and that's the real danger to it,\" Keiser said. \"As it spreads, it's going up the space between the muscle and skin, and as it does that, it kills all the nerves and the blood vessels can clot.\" \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n To prevent such deadly infections, proper wound care is key, according to Keiser and the CDC. \n \n Keep open wounds covered with clean, dry bandages until they heal, especially if you are working in floodwaters, and avoid contact with natural bodies of water if you have an open wound. Don't delay treating minor, non-infected wounds, and wash hands often with soap and water. \n \n Also, if you notice any redness or swelling of a wound, or if you have a fever, seek medical attention. ||||| Josue \"Cochito\" Gedeon Perez Zurita September 01, 1986 - October 16, 2017 \n \n \n \n Share this obituary \n \n GALVESTON: Josue \u201cCochito\u201d Gedeon Perez Zurita age 31 of Galveston died Monday, October 16, 2017 at Jennie Sealy Hospital in Galveston.

(AP) \n \n A 31-year-old Texas man died of a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection last week, nearly two months after Hurricane Harvey made landfall and the man began repairing homes damaged by the floods. \n \n On Monday, the Galveston County Health District said the man went to a hospital on Oct. 10 with a \u201cseriously\u201d infected wound on his upper left arm. He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis \u2014 a rare bacterial infection that kills soft tissue \u2014 and died six days later. \n \n The Houston news channel KHOU identified the man as Josue Zurita. An obituary said Zurita was a hard-working carpenter who left Mexico to help provide for his family, and that he became infected while working to rebuild Harris and Galveston counties. \n \n \u201cHe's a very caring person,\u201d Brenda Avalos, the wife of one of Zurita's cousins, told KHOU. \u201cHe has a lot of friends here in Galveston that love him. Everybody is very sad. He was very young and always smiling.\u201d \n \n [Houston spent massively on new stadiums, not its aging dams. As Harvey proved, that was a very bad.] \n \n Philip Keiser, the local health authority for Galveston County, said in a news release published by the health district that the infection most likely occurred when bacteria from hurricane debris or floodwater entered the man\u2019s body through a wound or cut. This case was the only known instance of necrotizing fasciitis in Galveston County related to Hurricane Harvey, according to the news release. \n \n Keiser told CNN that he has seen such infections spread over mere hours. \n \n \u201cEven in one case, as I was examining a patient, I could see the red spread in the minutes I was examining him, and that's the real danger to it,\u201d Keiser said. \u201cAs it spreads, it's going up the space between the muscle and skin, and as it does that, it kills all the nerves and the blood vessels can clot.\u201d \n \n Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane late on the night of Aug. 25. Analysts described the storm as a 1-in-1,000-year flood event that dominated huge swaths of Southeast Texas. In mid-September, Texas officials said more than 80 people had died as a result of the storm and the subsequent flooding throughout Houston and coastal areas, though it would take weeks to determine an exact death toll. \n \n Infectious disease after a flood is typically a short-term concern, as The Post's Ben Guarino reported last month. In September 2005, shortly after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the CDC reported 30 cases of MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus bacterium, among a group of evacuees sent to Dallas. \n \n Tetanus booster shots can be one means of defense against infectious diseases. The health district's news release also noted that proper wound care is vital to preventing infections. That includes keeping wounds covered with clean, dry bandages until they heal, and seeking medical attention for any redness, swelling or fever. Even minor, noninfected wounds \u2014 like blisters or scrapes \u2014 should be treated immediately. \n \n [Texans\u2019 do-it-ourselves rescue effort defines Hurricane Harvey] \n \n Stress also has a negative effect on the immune system, and ensuring food hygiene can be especially difficult in disaster zones. People\u2019s risk of getting sick increases further when they are packed into crowded areas, like a mega-shelter, after a natural disaster. \n \n The CDC warns against eating or drinking anything contaminated by floodwater that can cause diarrheal disease, such as E. coli or salmonella infection. \n \n CNN reported that on Sept. 15, a 77-year-old woman, Nancy Reed, also died of flesh-eating bacteria near Houston. A medical examiner report said the cause of the Reed's death was necrotizing fasciitis. Reed was helping her son clear out his home when she accidentally injured herself and contracted the disease, according to an associate pastor at the church that hosted Reed\u2019s memorial service. \n \n One man, J.R. Atkins, told KHOU earlier this month that he was fighting flesh-eating bacteria. Atkins, a former first responder, wrote on Facebook about how he \u201cnearly died\u201d after noticing a small bite on his left arm that gradually swelled to his hand. Atkins spent time in the ICU after kayaking through his neighborhood checking on people affected by the floods. \n \n On Facebook, Zurita was remembered his for his smile and willingness to help his neighbors. \n \n \u201cI'll never forget sitting on the front porch playing Lotteria [Mexican Bingo],\" read one post. \n \n Read more: \n \n Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier",

Josue Zurita, a carpenter helping repair flooded homes, died on Oct. 16, six days after he went to the hospital with a serious infection to his upper left arm, KHOU reports. Necrotizing fasciitis had already claimed the life of a 77-year-old Houston-area woman; a man who'd kayaked through floodwaters to check on neighbors and contracted the bacteria survived, per CNN. Dr. Philip Keiser, the local health authority for Galveston County, which announced Zurita's death on Monday, says the risk of contracting necrotizing fasciitis is \"well within what we would expect\" given the amount of construction and resulting injuries after the storm. \"You get some kind of break in the skin, and ... it's a fairly open space where the bacteria can grow,\" he notes. The infection can \"spread over hours,\" Keiser adds. Several types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis, which kills the body's soft tissue. The risk of disease following a flood is usually short-lived, per the Washington Post. But to prevent infection, it's important to treat even minor wounds by cleaning them thoroughly, then covering them with clean, dry bandages. Tetanus shots can prevent infection. Zurita was remembered in an obituary as a \"loving father and hardworking carpenter\" who moved to the US from Mexico to support his wife and daughter back home. \"He's a very caring person,\" a relative tells KHOU. \"He was very young and always smiling.\" (Sewage in floodwaters was a prime culprit for spreading infection.)",

Rand Paul of Kentucky blasted Trump's decision to launch strikes. | AP Photo Trump's Syria strikes divide Congress \u2014 but not along partisan lines \n \n President Donald Trump\u2019s missile attacks against the Syrian government on Thursday night split Congress into several camps, winning bipartisan backing from some senior lawmakers while also sparking a coalition of those on the left and right who raised constitutional concerns. \n \n Congressional leaders in both parties largely signaled their support. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called Trump\u2019s strikes \u201cappropriate and just\" and said he looks \"forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort.\" \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Top Democrats, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also offered their support, but both made clear they believed any escalation would require the approval of Congress. \n \n \u201cTonight\u2019s strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons,\" Pelosi said, but added, \u201cThe crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes.\" Durbin said \u201cany further action will require close scrutiny by Congress, and any escalation beyond airstrikes or missile strikes will require engaging the American people in that decision.\" \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \u201cMaking sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do.\u201d The New York Democrat added, though, that \u201cit is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, libertarian-minded Republicans like Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky blasted Trump's decision to launch strikes without first getting approval by Congress. \n \n \u201cThe President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution,\u201d Paul said in a Tweet. \n \n They were joined by liberal Democrats, including Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who also argued the use of force requires congressional approval under the Constitution. \n \n Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who was the lone member of Congress to vote against the 2001 war authorization against Al Qaeda, called the strikes an \u201cact of war\u201d and said Congress needs to come back into session and debate the matter. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called Trump's failure to seek congressional authorization \"unlawful.\" \n \n On the other side were Republican defense hawks, who offered full-throated praise for Trump\u2019s decision \u2014 including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, two of Trump\u2019s fiercest GOP critics on other issues. \n \n \u201cUnlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,\u201d McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. \u201cFor that, he deserves the support of the American people.\u201d \n \n Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another GOP defense hawk who has sometimes been critical of Trump, also issued a statement of support. \n \n \u201cBy acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,\u201d Rubio said. \n \n Congress and the White House have long been at odds over the president\u2019s constitutional war powers. \n \n Both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were authorized by Congress. But President Barack Obama did not seek congressional authorization for the 2011 military intervention in Libya. \n \n Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), along with more than 100 colleagues, signed a 2013 letter that sharply warned Obama against a unilateral attack. \"Engaging our military in Syria when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the Constitution,\" they wrote. \n \n Other GOP signatories included Rep. Lynn Jenkins of Kansas, who applauded Trump as \"decisive,\" and Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, who commended Trump for his \"swift action.\" A slew of other Republicans who praised Trump \u2014 including Don Young of Alaska, Martha Roby of Alabama, Roger Williams of Texas \u2014 opposed or leaned heavily against Obama's request to authorize the use of force in Syria while heaping praise on Trump Thursday night. \n \n The Congressional Research Service addressed the issue of war powers in a report last month, noting that \u201cin the post-Cold War world, presidents have continued to commit U.S. armed forces into potential hostilities, sometimes without a specific authorization from Congress.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt is generally agreed that the Commander-in-Chief role gives the President power to utilize the armed forces to repel attacks against the United States,\u201d CRS said in its report. \u201cBut there has long been controversy over whether he is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.\u201d \n \n The U.S. military has been conducting airstrikes in Syria since 2014, but these have been aimed at the Islamic State. The Obama and Trump administrations have cited as their legal justification for these strikes the authorization for use of military force passed by Congress after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. \n \n Thursday\u2019s strike was the first U.S. military action targeting the Bashar Assad regime in Syria, which Trump cast as retaliation for Assad\u2019s most recent chemical attack on his own people. \n \n \u201cTonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cIt is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.\u201d \n \n Elana Schor, Seung Min Kim and Heather Caygle contributed to this report. \n \n \n \n Members of Congress react to air strikes against Assad forces in Syria The United States launched air strikes against the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad on Thursday.

They\u2019re all part of the popular crowd, at least when it comes to baby names. \n \n \n \n Think Korie and Silas, of \"Duck Dynasty\" fame. Think George, as in the son of Duchess Kate, aka, the future king of England. And think Kanye (yes, seriously), the father of compass-inspired cutie North West. \n \n They are among the biggest trends of baby names on the rise in 2013, according to BabyCenter\u2019s annual baby names survey and list of top 100 names of 2013. In the boys category, Jackson moved up to take the top name, ending the 8-year reign of Aiden, while Sophia remained the top name for girls for the fourth year in a row. \n \n While the list is not the official Social Security Administration list, it is based on the names of a large sample, the 550,000 babies born this year to moms registered on BabyCenter\u2019s website. \n \n Linda Murray, BabyCenter Global editor in chief, says names with personal meaning \u2013 such as family names, grandparents and inspiring role models\u2014 were behind many of the top baby name trends. \n \n On the list of top 10 boys names are: Jackson, Aiden, Liam, Lucas, Noah, Mason, Jayden, Ethan, Jacob and Jack. The list of top 10 girls names is: Sophia, Emma, Olivia, Isabella, Mia, Ava, Lily, Zoe, Emily and Chloe. \n \n See the full list of top 100 names on BabyCenter \n \n Murray adds that this year, more than half of moms say they found name inspiration in people they know, while celebrity influence was on the decline. \n \n But, even though celeb names are less popular, some are still moving up in presence on the list. Of the key characters on the reality show \"Duck Dynasty,\" the name Korie increased by 89 percent and Mia was up 44 percent while Phil, Sadie and Silas were up 32, 23 and 15 percent, respectively. \n \n What\u2019s the appeal of this camouflage-loving crew? Moms apparently love their likable personalities and that they are a loving, funny family of real Americans who have made it big, the study found. \n \n Of course it\u2019s no surprise that royal baby George has such a powerful influence, but one twist is that the name George \u2014 for a girl \u2014 is up 37 percent in popularity, while versions Giorgio and Georgia also went up. \n \n What was more surprising was that baby North West gave both her parents names a boost, with Kanye going up 38 percent, likely a result of his improved image since he has shown himself to be a family man. The name West is up 22 percent and Kimberly is up 6 percent. \n \n In other celebrity upticks, the women of the HBO show \"Girls\" have all become a hit, with character names Marnie and Shoshanna up 62 and 67 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, series creator Lena Dunham\u2019s name moved up by 26 percent, more than double that of her character name of Hannah. \n \n \n \n And while the gals from \"Girls\" are a hit, celebrity bad girls are decidedly not. The study found that some celebs who received negative press in the past year had their name popularity tumble, such as Reese Witherspoon (Reese went down 45 percent), Paula Deen (Paula was down 20 percent), and Lindsay Lohan (Lindsay was down 17 percent). \n \n Among the TODAY anchors\u2019 names, Al and Hoda had the most gains in popularity, with Al increasing by 18 percent, and Hoda by 15 percent. Willie had a modest gain of 4 percent. Savannah and Carson both had the biggest drop of 12 percent while the names Matt and Natalie dropped by 11 percent. \n \n What about Kathie Lee and Tamron? Well, BabyCenter found no babies with those names in its database. Maybe next year, ladies.",

    "document": "By Phil Williams \n \n Chief Investigative Reporter \n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Are leaders of a for-profit public school trying to hide the fact their students are failing? \n \n That's the question that some are asking tonight as a result of an email uncovered by NewsChannel 5 Investigates. \n \n At the center of the controversy is the Tennessee Virtual Academy -- a for-profit, online public school that Republican lawmakers touted as a way to improve education in Tennessee. Two years ago, state lawmakers voted to let K12 Inc. open the school, using millions of taxpayer dollars. \n \n But, now, those lawmakers are concerned about standardized test results that put it among the worst schools in the state. \n \n In fact, the email suggests that even school leaders are becoming increasingly concerned by how their students' grades may look to parents and the public. \n \n \"That is not something I would ever be told in my school -- I mean, it's just not acceptable,\" said state Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat who is also a career teacher. \"Quite honestly, I was horrified.\" \n \n The email -- labeled \"important -- was written in December by the Tennessee Virtual Academy's vice principal to middle school teachers. \n \n \"After ... looking at so many failing grades, we need to make some changes before the holidays,\" the email begins. \n \n Among the changes: Each teacher \"needs to take out the October and September progress [reports]; delete it so that all that is showing is November progress.\" \n \n \"Does it talk about we need to make changes in curriculum? Does it talk about we need to make changes in our teaching strategy? No,\" Rep. Johnson observed. \"Those changes we need to make are deleting grades from the computer system.\" \n \n \"And that's cheating in your mind?\" NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked. \n \n \"In my mind, sure. I mean, yes.\" \n \n The email adds, \"This cannot be late!\" \n \n \"To come in and say 'everybody who made failing grades the first two months, we need to delete those grades,' to me that's a huge issue,\" Johnson added. \n \n And the suggestions from K12 leaders don't end there. \n \n In traditional classrooms, if students score a 60 on one test and a 90 on a second test, they're stuck with a 75 average. But the email suggests that teachers erase the bad grades, leaving students with just the good grades. \n \n The email continues, \"If you have given an assignment and most of your students failed that assignment, then you need to take that grade out.\" \n \n Read the TNVA email, response \n \n \"This doesn't say give them a second chance,\" we noted. \n \n \"No, it does not,\" the lawmaker agreed. \"It just says take that out. To me, this appears like it's grade fixing.\" \n \n K12 officials refused to sit down to answer our questions, but the Tennessee Virtual Academy's principal said in an email that the goal was to \"more accurately recognize students' current progress.\" \n \n \"By going back into our school's electronic grading system and recording students' most recent progress score (instead of taking the average throughout the semester) we could more accurately recognize students' current progress in their individualized learning program,\" principal Josh Williams said in the statement. \n \n \"This also helped differentiate those and identify those who needed instructional intervention and remediation.\" \n \n Williams compared K12's grade deletions to the \"common practice in traditional schools\" of allowing \"make-up tests, alternative assessments and extra credit opportunities.\" \n \n Yet, the internal email also suggests that Virtual Academy teachers had already attempted those sorts of efforts to boost student grades. \n \n \"In early December, all teachers gave their students an opportunity to improve their grades by giving additional assignments,\" it says. \n \n \"Yet, we are still seeing failing grades.\" \n \n As to K12's explanation, Mitchell Johnson, interim director of the Tennessee Education Association, questioned how deleting data helps K12 to better understand students' needs. \n \n \"They're probably changing the grades to make themselves look better,\" he speculated. \n \n It's a practice that the TEA official suggested would not sit well with privatization advocates if they saw a \"delete it\" email from a traditional public school. \n \n \"I think that they would be incensed, and I'm hoping that the reformers will be as incensed about what has happened here -- as they would be if it had happened within a public school setting,\" he added. \n \n In the email, teachers were also told that their main focus is on reading and math -- and that they are not as concerned about students making F's in history and science. \n \n But the principal of the Tennessee Virtual Academy noted that, ultimately, the school's success or failure will be judged based on the standardized tests that students take at the end of the year -- not on individual grades. \n \n Because of concerns about the Tennessee Virtual Academy's performance, Gov. Bill Haslam has proposed legislation that would cap the number of students who could enroll at 5,000. It's at about 3,200 right now. \n \n There is also a bill up in a House subcommittee Tuesday that would essentially shut it down. \n \n E-mail: pwilliams@newschannel5.com ||||| Humphrey on the Hill Tom Humphrey's blog on politics and legislative news in Tennessee \n \n NASHVILLE \u2014 A House committee killed legislation that would have closed Union County-based Tennessee Virtual Academy on Tuesday after one Knoxville legislator effectively blocked another from talking to the committee about allegations that the for-profit school altered the bad grades of some students. \n \n Instead, the House Education Subcommittee approved a bill pushed by Gov. Bill Haslam's administration that puts some new restrictions on virtual schools, but only after eliminating \u2014 with the governor's approval \u2014 a proposed 5,000-student enrollment cap that was originally part of House Bill 151. \n \n Democratic Rep. Mike Stewart of Nashville sponsored the bill (HB728) that would have effectively repealed the law passed in 2011 that allowed for-profit virtual schools to operate in Tennessee. \n \n The 2011 bill was sponsored by Rep. Harry Brooks, R-Knoxville, who is now chairman of the House Education Committee and sponsor of the Haslam administration bill changing some rules for running virtual schools. \n \n Stewart told the committee that Tennessee Virtual Academy, part of a system of virtual schools operated around the nation by K12 Inc., has proved itself in a year of operation a \"bad idea\" for both its students, who have had low scores in testing, and for taxpayers. \n \n \"The only people that are benefiting are in K12, a Virginia corporation that is rising statewide to siphon off millions of dollars every year ... for enormous profits,\" said Stewart, adding that K12 CEO Ronald Packard was paid $3.9 million last year and $5 million the year before. \n \n Rep. Roger Kane, R-Knoxville, told Stewart his talk of Packard's salary was a \"red herring\" and otherwise criticized the Nashville lawmaker's statements \u2014 drawing applause from perhaps 25 Virtual Academy teachers, students and parents of students in the audience. \n \n One Virtual Academy teacher, Summer Shelton of Knoxville, told the panel she had taught in Knox County and elsewhere \u2014 including Europe \u2014 and considered the academy as having \"the most dynamic curriculum\" and the best overall, especially beneficial to children with special problems, such as feeling stressed in regular schools. \n \n Legislative staff found that Tennessee Virtual Academy is receiving $7.5 million in state funding this year. \n \n Stewart told the committee that the company receives $5,300 per student \"essential to turn on a website\" and has refused to give any information on how much it spends \u2014 which he estimated at $1,000 to $2,000 per student. He challenged K12 to provide the information, though there was no response during the session. \n \n After the meeting, Ken Meyer, director of government relations for K12, told reporters that Stewart's figures are wrong and K12 has lost money in its first year of operation. \n \n Actually, he said the Tennessee operation gets $4,700 per student, gives Union County about $300 in accordance with its contract, and thus receives only about $4,400 per student. Meyer said the company's costs are about $6,600 per student, adding he was going by memory and would give more precise figures later. \n \n Stewart also cited an email sent to Virtual Academy teachers in December that says they should \"take out the October and September progress (reports); delete it so that all that is showing is November progress reports.\" \n \n He distributed the email, which was provided by Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, to him and to WTVF-TV in Nashville, which aired a report on the matter Monday evening. Johnson, a Knox County schoolteacher, said she had been given the email by a Virtual Academy teacher. \n \n Stewart asked that Johnson be allowed to speak to the committee. Brooks objected, saying the email had nothing to do with the Stewart bill under discussion. The committee chairman made a motion to end all discussion and proceed immediately to a vote on the bill. \n \n Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis, presiding at the subcommittee meeting, promptly declared Brooks' motion approved by voice vote, then immediately called for a vote on the bill. It was declared defeated on voice vote. \n \n Afterward, Johnson and Shelton spent several minutes discussing the email, which Shelton said had been misunderstood. She said the school had a new \"grade book\" for teachers to report student progress. Some teachers were averaging grades while others were using the most recent grade, Shelton said. The email was to clarify that the most recent grade \u2014 as a measure of progress \u2014 should be used, she said. In many situations, she said the student had taken a test twice, in which case the second grade is used. \n \n After hearing out Shelton, Johnson said she understood much of the lengthy explanation, but overall \"it's not quite jiving 100 percent.\" She also questioned why K12 or Virtual Academy executives had not testified or answered questions. \n \n The Haslam administration bill, sponsored by Brooks, was approved on a 6-3 vote. \n \n As amended, it imposes a 1,500-student cap on new virtual schools launched in the state, but not on those already operating. The original bill would have covered Tennessee Virtual Academy \u2014 which now has about 3,200 students \u2014 with a 5,000 cap. That was dropped by an amendment. \n \n The bill has other provisions that declare a virtual school that has below-standard student performance for two consecutive years can be closed by the state's education commission. \n \n The commissioner would also have the option to instead impose an enrollment cap.",

It didn\u2019t out rogue liberal IRS agents with an ax to grind against nonprofit tea party groups. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n But the watchdog report did break new ground, clearly declaring that the IRS crossed the line in asking about donors to conservative groups. It reveals the IRS to be a stubborn agency that isn\u2019t ready to fix all the problems in the report. And it warns that a crackdown on these 501(c)(4) groups isn\u2019t coming any time soon. \n \n ( PHOTOS: 10 slams on the IRS) \n \n Here\u2019s the top five things takeaways from the Inspector General report: \n \n IRS agents weren't partisan \n \n Republicans looking for a smoking gun on partisan motive will have to keep looking \u2014 the report stops short of calling the IRS intentionally partisan, even if the questions might have been inappropriate. \n \n Most of the report focuses on reprimanding the IRS for choosing ineffective criteria that could be construed as partisan rather than focusing on a partisan motive. Only about 15 percent of the potential cases had the terms \u201cTea Party,\u201d \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201c9/12\u201d in their organization name. The remaining cases were flagged for other reasons. \n \n The report found that the narrow focus of the criteria \u201cgives the appearance that the IRS is not impartial in conducting its mission.\u201d \n \n \u201cUsing the names or policy positions of organizations is not an appropriate basis for identifying applications for review by the team of specialists,\u201d the inspector general said. \n \n ( Also on POLITICO: Watchdog: IRS used 'inappropriate criteria') \n \n The report never directly accuses the IRS of bias, just the appearance of impropriety. \n \n Despite the inappropriate search criteria, the majority of applications flagged by the Cincinnati office had indications of significant violations of tax policy. The report found that about 69 percent of the fully documented cases on the list were properly identified. \n \n Unclear on whether the IRS misled Congress \n \n The report remains silent on what is emerging as the biggest Republican grievance \u2014 how Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller and former Commissioner Doug Shulman failed to disclose to Congress what they learned about the targeting program after May 2012. \n \n Miller wrote letters to the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Republicans months after he was briefed but never disclosed that the agency was giving an extra critical eye to conservative groups. Government oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) also accused division head Lois Lerner of misleading Congress after her June 2011 discovery. \n \n \u201cIt appears that you provided false or misleading information on four separate occasions last year in response to the committee\u2019s oversight of the IRS\u2019s treatment of conservative groups applying for tax exempt status,\u201d Issa and committee member Rep.

That may be the biggest victory for frustrated conservatives. \n \n The report also makes clear that the IRS knew that it overstepped its bounds when it asked for donor records. \n \n \u201cOfficials informed us that they decided to destroy all donor lists that were sent in for potential political cases that the IRS determined it should not have requested,\u201d the report said. ||||| This just out: The Treasury Department's Inspector General report argues that the IRS developed \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d in focusing on conservative groups. Here are the key findings: \n \n The IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention. Ineffective management: 1) allowed inappropriate criteria to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, 2) resulted in substantial delays in processing certain applications, and 3) allowed unnecessary information requests to be issued. \n \n And here's the full report: \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/05/201310053fr-revised-redacted-1.pdf \n \n My colleagues Juliet Eilperin and Zachary Goldfarb have a write-up of the report as well. ||||| \"Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review.\" \n \n That's the title of the Inspector General's report on the IRS's treatment of tea-party related groups. It's not a very good title. A better one might be \"How a group of I.R.S. employees created a politically biased test for 501(c)(4) applicants, got smacked down, quietly created another politically biased test, and then got smacked down even harder -- but in the process, created a lot of delays and trouble for the groups caught in their net.\" \n \n Okay, so that's not such a good title, either. \n \n \n \n The key story of the report seems to be this: In the summer of 2010, in response to a huge surge in 501(c)(4) applications and media stories that some of these groups were illegally acting like political organizations, a group of IRS officials developed inappropriate criteria for identifying overly politicized 501(c)(4)s applicants. Those criteria included looking for the words \"tea party\" or related terms. In July 2011, the director of the IRS told them to knock it off and use more politically neutral criteria that focused on the activities of the group rather than the name or ideology of the group. \n \n Here's where things get interesting: In January 2012, that same group of IRS officials goes rogue and changes the test back without getting management approval. According to the IG report, \"they believed the July 2011 criteria were too broad.\" They're found out three months later and, in May 2012, a new IRS director again demands the test is revised to \"more clearly focus on activities permitted under the Treasury Regulations.\" That's the test the IRS is using now, and the IG seems comfortable with it. \n \n Management, however, isn't happy with what's been going on. They issue \"a memorandum requiring all original entries and changes to criteria...be approved at the executive level prior to implementation.\" \n \n So that's the core of the story. But it's not the whole story. Much of the report is about confusion, incompetence, and unacceptable delays in the IRS unit that manages questionable 501(c)(4) applications. There's no allegation here of politicization. But it's nevertheless unacceptable: \n \n Many organizations waited much longer than 13 months for a decision, while others have yet to receive a decision from the IRS. For example, as of December 17, 2012, the IRS had been processing several potential political cases for more than 1,000 calendar days. Some of these organizations received requests for additional information in Calendar Year 2010 and then did not hear from the IRS again for more than a year while the Determinations Unit waited for assistance from the Technical Unit. For the 296 potential political cases we reviewed, 33 as of December 17, 2012, 108 applications had been approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been denied, and 160 cases were open from 206 to 1,138 calendar days (some crossing two election cycles). \n \n Those aren't reasonable delays. Then there's this charming tidbit: Some of the \"letters requested that the information be provided in two or three weeks (as is customary in these letters) despite the fact that the IRS had done nothing with some of the applications for more than one year.\" Imagine you're the director of a hopeful 501(c)(4) that applied to the IRS a year ago, got no response, and then all of a sudden you receive a letter demanding tons of information within two or three weeks. It's absurd. \n \n These delays impose a real cost, too. It's been noted that none of the groups caught in this net were rejected for 501(c)(4) status. That's true. But many of them are still waiting for a ruling, and others saw their activities held up for over two years. \n \n Some of the information the IRA requested was also inappropriate, and could've revealed donor information that the 501(c)(4) designation is designed to keep secret. Again, quoting the IG report: \"The Determinations Unit requested donor information from 27 organizations that it would be required to make public if the application was approved, even though this information could not be disclosed by the IRS when provided by organizations whose tax-exempt status had been approved.\" \n \n The key question related to the political test remains: Why hasn't anyone been fired? It's not definitive whether there's any evidence that the IRS employees who created the tea-party-focused test and then recreated it after the director objected did so for political reasons. It certainly seems possible. And even if their actions were entirely non-political there was a lot of incompetence and a bit of insubordination. What were the consequences? \n \n The key procedural questions related to uncertainty and delays in the 501(c)(4) designation process are laid out in the report. Of the IG's nine recommendations, the IRS has agreed to implement seven of them, and has proposed alternatives for the remaining two (the disagreements are over how to document the reasons that applications are chosen for review and how to train IRS specialists on the issue). \n \n Unless significant further evidence comes out, however, this doesn't look like the rot went particularly deep. The most cynical interpretation of the facts of the case laid out by the IG are that a group of mid-level IRS employees created a politically motivated screening process for 501(c)(4) applications. They were stopped, twice, by IRS management, and procedures were put in place to ensure they couldn't do anything like it again. The employees failed, but the system seems to have worked, though not before a lot of groups received some pretty shabby treatment.",

    "document": "In the United States, youth have the highest burden of nonfatal self-inflicted injury (ie, deliberate physical harm against oneself, inclusive of suicidal and nonsuicidal intent) requiring medical attention.1 One study found that emergency department (ED) visits for these injuries during the 1993 to 2008 period varied by age group, ranging from 1.1 to 9.6 per 1000 ED visits, with adolescents aged 15 to 19 years exhibiting the highest rates.1 Self-inflicted injury is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide\u2014the second-leading cause of death among those aged 10 to 24 years during 2015.2 This study examined trends in nonfatal self-inflicted injuries treated in hospital EDs among US children, adolescents, and young adults aged 10 to 24 years (hereafter referred to as youth). \n \n Methods \n \n The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\u2014All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) collects data on all first-time visits for nonfatal injuries treated in 66 US hospital EDs through stratified probability sampling, allowing for the derivation of national estimates.3 Self-inflicted injuries were identified by reviewing injury cause narratives and other coded data within ED records. This study used publicly available secondary data and was exempted by the CDC from institutional review board review. \n \n Self-inflicted injury ED visit rates were calculated from 2001 through 2015 by sex, age (10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years), along with injury method (poisoning, sharp object, blunt object), and 95% CIs using US Census population estimates as denominators. Rates were weighted to obtain nationally representative estimates and age-adjusted to the 2000 US Census population. Trends in self-inflicted injury ED visit rates were assessed using joinpoint regression software (Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute), version 4.3.1.0. The annual percentage change described the rate of change for each linear segment. \n \n Results \n \n From 2001 to 2015, NEISS-AIP captured 43 138 youth self-inflicted injury ED visits. The overall weighted age-adjusted rate for this group showed no statistically significant trend until 2008, increasing 5.7% (95% CI, 3.0%-8.4%) annually thereafter and reaching 303.7 per 100 000 population (95% CI, 254.1-353.3) in 2015 (Table). Age-adjusted trends for males overall and across age groups remained stable throughout 2001-2015 (Figure, Table). Overall age-adjusted rates for females demonstrated no statistically significant trend before 2009, yet increased 8.4% (95% CI, 5.6%-11.2%) yearly from 2009 to 2015. After 2009, rates among females aged 10 to 14 years increased 18.8% (95% CI, 12.1%-25.8%) per year\u2014from 109.8 (95% CI, 69.9-149.7) in 2009 to 317.7 (95% CI, 230.3-405.1) per 100 000 population in 2015. Rates among females aged 15 to 19 years showed a 7.2% (95% CI, 3.8%-10.8%) increase per year during 2008-2015. Rates among females aged 20 to 24 years exhibited a 2.0% (95% CI, 0.8%-3.1%) increase per year throughout 2001-2015 (Figure, Table). \n \n Trends for all self-inflicted injury methods were stable for males. Poisoning was the most common method of self-inflicted injury for females, with rates remaining stable until 2007 and increasing 5.3% (95% CI, 0.5%-10.4%) annually thereafter. Female rates for self-inflicted injuries by sharp object increased 7.1% (95% CI, 5.2%-8.9%) annually throughout 2001-2015; female rates for blunt object injuries were stable during 2006-2015 (Table). \n \n Discussion \n \n Youth self-inflicted injury ED visit rates were relatively stable before 2008. However, rates among females significantly increased thereafter\u2014particularly among females aged 10 to 14 years, who experienced an 18.8% annual increase from 2009 to 2015. This study only included ED cases; thus, rates were underestimated. Also, limited statistical power could have resulted in some trends not showing statistical significance. Findings are consistent with previously reported upward trends in youth suicide rates during 1999-2014, in which rates increased most notably after 2006 with females aged 10 to 14 years experiencing the greatest increase.4 Findings also coincide with increased reports of depression among youth, especially young girls.5 Other potential underlying reasons for the observed increasing trends, particularly among young females, warrant further study. \n \n These findings underscore the need for the implementation of evidence-based, comprehensive suicide and self-harm prevention strategies within health systems and communities. These strategies include strengthening access to and delivery of care for suicidal youth within health systems and creating protective environments, promoting youth connectedness, teaching coping and problem-solving skills, and identifying and supporting at-risk youth within communities.6 \n \n Section Editor: Jody W.

One important reason to focus on reducing self-harm is that it is key risk factor for suicide,\" said Dr. Mark Olfson, a Columbia University psychiatry professor who was not involved in the study. \n \n The sharpest increase occurred among girls aged 10 to 14, nearly tripling from 2009 to 2015, from about 110 visits per 100,000 to almost 318 per 100,000. \n \n Older teen girls had the highest rates \u2014 633 visits per 100,000 in 2015, but the increase after 2008 was less steep. \n \n Drug overdoses and other self-poisonings were the most common method among girls and boys, followed by intentional cutting with sharp objects. The study doesn't include information on which methods were most common by age nor on how many injuries were severe or required hospitalization. \n \n All the injuries were intentional, but not all were suicide attempts, said lead author Melissa Mercado, a behavioral scientist. \n \n The study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Nearly 29,000 girls with self-inflicted injuries and about 14,000 boys were treated in emergency rooms during the study years. \n \n Rates among boys didn't change much during those years. Rates in girls were also stable until around 2008. ER visits for self-injury among young women aged 20 to 24 also increased but at a slower pace, rising from 228 per 100,000 in 2001 to 346 per 100,000 in 2015. \n \n The results underestimate the problem since they don't include self-injuries treated in doctors' offices or elsewhere, Mercado said. \n \n Researchers said the findings underscore the need to beef up prevention efforts including finding ways to help at-risk kids feel less isolated and more connected to their peers, and teaching coping and problem-solving skills. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Lindsey Tanner on Twitter: @LindseyTanner.

The sharpest increase occurred among girls aged 10 to 14, nearly tripling from 2009 to 2015, from about 110 visits per 100,000 to almost 318 per 100,000. Older teen girls had the highest rates\u2014633 visits per100,000 in 2015, but the increase after 2008 was less steep. Drug overdoses and other self-poisonings were the most common method among girls and boys, followed by intentional cutting with sharp objects. The study doesn't include information on which methods were most common by age nor on how many injuries were severe or required hospitalization, reports the AP. All the injuries were intentional, but not all were suicide attempts, said lead author Melissa Mercado, a behavioral scientist.",

This is mental illness.\u201d \n \n At a rally in suburban Nashville on Saturday, Trump mentioned his New York state handgun carry permit and added that anyone who attacked him would be \u201cshocked\u201d, because he would emulate Charles Bronson in the vigilante film Death Wish. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m a very, very big second amendment person,\u201d Trump said in Tennessee. \u201cThis is about self-defense, plain and simple.\u201d \n \n Trump reminisced about the Bronson-starring 1974 film and got people in the crowd to shout out the title in unison.

It doesn\u2019t seem to work.\u201d \n \n Instead, at both rally and in the interview, as on the day of the shooting, the Republican frontrunner blamed mental illness for such shootings as that at Umpqua Community College. \n \n Trump also defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years, by noting his ability to cut costs. He pointed to transportation as one place where he could save money. \n \n \u201cI look at the cost of a road where they\u2019re gonna spend $600m building a simple road,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna save you a little bit.

He claimed instead that the major tax cut in his plan would hurt him financially. Under the current tax code, Trump said, \u201cI have very big deductions, some of them are ridiculous.\u201d \n \n He also hit back when NBC\u2019s Todd pointed to polls which have him losing by a landslide to both vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in any such general election matchup. \n \n Trump, who has long touted his poll numbers in the Republican primary, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t focused on Bernie Sanders.\u201d \n \n He added: \u201cI\u2019ve been a guy that wins most of the time.

Anthony Weiner leaves Federal court, Friday, May 19, 2017, in New York. Weiner pleaded guilty to transmitting sexual material to a minor. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, whose penchant for sexting strangers ended his political career and sparked a probe that upended the presidential race, pleaded guilty Friday to a sex charge, tearfully apologizing for communications with a 15-year-old girl that he said destroyed his \"life's dream in public service.\" \n \n Weiner, who could go to prison, pleaded guilty to a single count of transmitting obscene material to a minor. He admitted exchanging online messages with the girl beginning in January 2015 and \"sharing explicit images and encouraging her to engage in sexually explicit conduct.\" \n \n \"I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse,\" he said. \n \n In court, the 52-year-old former Democratic congressman paused repeatedly as he fought back tears and tried to compose himself. He said he knew the texting was \"as morally wrong as it was unlawful.\" \n \n Pleading to the charge, which requires him to register as a sex offender, could bring a sentence of up to 10 years. But Weiner is likely to serve a much shorter term if he is sentenced to prison. He signed a plea agreement with prosecutors in which he agreed not to appeal any sentence between 21 and 27 months in prison. His lawyer can request leniency at a sentencing scheduled for Sept. 8. \n \n Wearing his wedding ring and a dark blue suit with a maroon tie, Weiner read from a prepared statement after U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska addressed him: \"Tell me what you did, sir.\" \n \n He said he \"compulsively sought attention from women who contacted me on social media\" beginning with his service in Congress and continuing through the first half of last year. \n \n \"I engaged with many of them in both sexual and nonsexual conversation,\" he said. \"These destructive impulses brought great devastation to my family and friends and destroyed my life's dream in public service. Yet I remained in denial even as the world around me fell apart.\" \n \n Weiner said he began getting mental health treatment in the fall, when he said he \"came to grips for the first time with the depths of my sickness.\" He said he continues to follow the treatment daily. \n \n \"I had hit bottom,\" he said. \"Through treatment I found the courage to take a moral inventory of my defects.\" \n \n Weiner apologized to \"everyone I have hurt,\" including the girl he \"mistreated so badly.\" \n \n Finished speaking, he wiped his eyes with tissues. \n \n Weiner was already in federal custody ahead of the hearing, which lasted less than a half hour. Afterward, he shook hands with prosecutors, telling them: \"Thanks, guys. I appreciate your service.\" \n \n He then went down the courthouse elevator surrounded by his lawyers and court officers and left the building. He said nothing to reporters. His wife, Huma Abedin, was not in court. \n \n Abedin, a top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last year, separated from Weiner in September after revelations he had sent more sexually charged messages online. \n \n That same month, the FBI began investigating Weiner after the North Carolina girl told the news website DailyMail.com that she and Weiner had exchanged lewd messages for several months. \n \n She also accused him of asking her to undress on camera. As part of his plea, Weiner agreed to forfeit his iPhone. \n \n The investigation led FBI agents to seize his laptop computer, which led to the discovery of a new cache of emails that Clinton had sent to Abedin. \n \n In late October, just days before the election, FBI Director James Comey stunned the country by announcing that his agency was reopening its closed investigation into Clinton's handling of State Department business on a private email server so it could analyze the newly discovered correspondence. \n \n That inquiry was brief. Comey announced shortly before the election that the new emails contained nothing to change his view that Clinton could not be charged with a crime. But Clinton partly blamed her loss to Republican Donald Trump on Comey's announcement. \n \n Weiner, who represented New York in Congress from 1999 to 2011, resigned after revelations that he was sending sexually explicit messages to multiple women. \n \n He ran for New York City mayor in 2013 and was leading several polls until it was revealed he had continued his questionable behavior. His failed mayoral bid was the subject of the documentary \"Weiner.\" ||||| Former representative Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) was sentenced Sept. 25 to 21 months in jail for transferring obscene material to a minor. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \n \n This post, originally published in May, has been updated with news that Weiner has been sentenced to 21 months in jail for sexting with a minor. \n \n He was a congressman, he was a sexter. \n \n He was a mayoral candidate, he was a sexter. \n \n He was the subject of a cringing documentary, he was a sexter. \n \n He was ultimately the owner of a computer, seized by the FBI for sexting, that ended up playing a massive role in the 2016 presidential election. He was the husband of one of Hillary Clinton's trusted aides, and now he's about to be her ex-husband. \n \n And now, Anthony Weiner will go to jail. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison Monday after pleading guilty in May to a single charge of sending obscene material to a minor, related a 15-year-old girl he'd been talking to online. \n \n This is Weiner's story, and it's a sad one. \n \n Since the New York Democratic congressman resigned in 2011, Weiner popped back into the public sphere like the creatures from one of those whack-a-mole games at the arcade, often when we'd least expect him. And each time, the political world couldn't look away. And each time, we felt something different about this man and his phone and his self-described addiction. \n \n [Why do politicians cheat?] \n \n Weiner's story was first late-night-TV-worthy (a picture of his you-know-what out there on Twitter? And his last name is Weiner?!). \n \n It morphed into a classic politician sex scandal, his devoted and poised wife standing next to him: \u201cI have said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have,\u201d he said in a 2013 news conference as new sexts emerged in the middle of his failed run for mayor of New York City. \"\u2026 There is no question that what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me.\u201d \n \n Then-New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, at a 2013 news conference. (Eric Thayer/Reuters) \n \n Then Weiner's story became a bloody car crash unfolding on our TV screens as \u201cWeiner,\u201d a May 2016 documentary about that mayoral run that immolated his higher-profile wife. Huma Abedin was in the middle of trying to hold together a presidential campaign for her longtime boss and friend, Hillary Clinton, and the documentary probing the rifts in her marriage was just plain weird. \n \n \u201cIt was astonishing for Abedin to have allowed such a film as 'Weiner' to be made at all \u2014 much less to put a high-definition, close-up lens to the most humiliating chapter of her life,\u201d wrote The Washington Post's Karen Tumulty. \n \n Also, what about Weiner? \u201cWhy would Weiner want such a film out there? Is it a blind addiction to the spotlight? Some kind of twisted PR ploy? An effort to humanize himself?\u201d I asked at the time. \n \n Apparently Weiner got some kind of boost from it. He tried to bait Donald Trump Jr. into running against him for mayor of New York City. \n \n .@anthonyweiner on @DonaldJTrumpJr 4 Mayor of NYC: \"I'd come out of retirement just to beat him like a rented mule\" pic.twitter.com/C9YCDZ74A0 \u2014 Joe Toohey (@joetoohey) July 26, 2016 \n \n Too soon Anthony!!!

A few months after the documentary was released, Weiner sexted again. This time with his toddler son in the bed next to him.

But Weiner wasn't done with us. \n \n The FBI seized his computer to investigate whether he had sent inappropriate photos or videos to a minor. And on that computer, they found something else: emails Clinton sent and received using a private server while secretary of state. \n \n Eleven days before the presidential election, Weiner's sexting turned into a political bomb for Democrats. Then-FBI Director James B. Comey told Congress the FBI had found new Clinton emails in an unrelated investigation. \n \n \u201cI can't consider for a second whose political fortunes will be affected in that way,\u201d Comey would testify to Congress months later. \n \n Clinton lost the election. She'd later come to the conclusion that Anthony Weiner's sexual desires \u2014 and the FBI's decision to tell Congress the world about her previously undiscovered secretary of state emails sitting on a server with Weiner's sexts \u2014 were a big reason she lost. \n \n \u201cWhen we heard this Huma looked stricken,\u201d Clinton wrote in her new book \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d \u201cAnthony had already caused so much heartache.

It was inevitable that this guy we wanted nothing more of would play a starring role in one of the biggest news stories of one of the biggest presidential elections in recent memory. \n \n Arguably, Weiner is STILL haunting us. Comey testified to Congress in May that Abedin had \u201cforwarded hundreds and thousands\u201d of Clinton emails to her husband, which is one reason the FBI director decided to alert Congress so close to the election. Turns out there were far fewer emails on Weiner's computer, the FBI announced several days later. \n \n That evening, Trump fired Comey (although he didn't originally say it was because of Comey's misstatements, it was a good excuse to pull the trigger). And now Trump is living with the consequences of that decision, an investigation into whether he obstructed justice.

These destructive impulses brought great devastation to family and friends, and destroyed my life\u2019s dream of public service. And yet I remained in denial even as the world around me fell apart. \n \n In late January 2016, I was contacted by and began exchanging online messages with a stranger who said that she was a high school student and who I understood to be 15 years old. Through approximately March 2016, I engaged in obscene communications with this teenager, including sharing explicit images and encouraging her to engage in sexually explicit conduct, just as I had done and continued to do with adult women. I knew this was as morally wrong as it was unlawful. \n \n This fall, I came to grips for the first time with the depths of my sickness. I had hit bottom. I entered intensive treatment, found the courage to take a moral inventory of my defects, and began a program of recovery and mental health treatment that I continue to follow every day. \n \n I accept full responsibility for my conduct. I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse. I apologize to everyone I have hurt. I apologize to the teenage girl, whom I mistreated so badly.

Prosecutors said 21 to 27 months would be \"fair and appropriate,\" and the AP notes that Weiner agreed not to appeal any sentence of that length. He also could be spared jail altogether. Keeping track: Having trouble remembering all the Weiner scandals? This timeline of his career from the AP might help. Affecting an election: If Hillary Clinton blames James Comey for her loss, then she should be blaming Weiner, too. CNN lays out how his sexting got tangled up in her email trouble. How sad: Amber Phillips assesses it all at the Washington Post, including the question of why on earth Weiner and Abedin allowed a documentary to be made about them.

A 23-year-old with no criminal history, Ramirez had been granted a permit to live and work legally in the U.S. under DACA, which specifically protects children who were brought to the U.S. by their undocumented parents. These young people, also known as DREAMers, named after the proposed DREAM act. \n \n If Ramirez\u2019s detention was intentional, he would be the first DACA recipient arrested under the Trump administration, an act that could signal further arrests of immigrants who had been considered, for the moment at least, legal residents of the U.S. \n \n Just last month, President Donald Trump seemed to imply that protections would still apply to immigrants who were granted DACA, telling David Muir of ABC News that people \u201cshouldn\u2019t be very worried. I do have a big heart. We\u2019re going to take care of everybody.\u201d \n \n Now, Ramirez, who is still in custody, has filed a challenge against his detention, arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights by arresting him after he had previously been granted permission to stay in the United States. \n \n In his lawsuit, Ramirez claims he had disclosed his DACA paperwork twice to ICE officers, once in his father\u2019s home and a second time while in a processing center. \n \n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, because you weren\u2019t born in this country,\u201d one of the agents reportedly said. \n \n ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. \n \n This post has been updated throughout. ||||| Immigrants and civil-rights attorneys have filed a petition in federal court in Seattle seeking the release of a 23-year-old Mexican immigrant brought illegally into the United States as a child but given a work permit under the Obama administration. \n \n Immigrants and civil-rights attorneys have filed a petition in federal court in Seattle seeking the release of a 23-year-old Mexican immigrant brought illegally into the United States as a child but given a work permit under the Obama administration. \n \n The petition challenges the immigration detention and seeks the release of Daniel Ramirez Medina, who his attorneys say was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents Friday. The agents were conducting an action at his father\u2019s house and Medina was detained, according to the news service Reuters and a news release by the attorneys in his case. \n \n ICE countered in an email Tuesday night that Medina \u2014 whom they identify as \u201cMr. Ramirez\u201d \u2014 was a \u201cself-admitted gang member\u201d encountered during the arrest of a felon who had previously been deported. \n \n He is in custody at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma \u201cto await the outcome of removal proceedings,\u201d said ICE Northwest spokeswoman Rose Richeson. \n \n \u201cICE officers took Mr. Ramirez into custody based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety,\u201d Richeson said. \n \n ICE did not respond when asked whether Medina has a criminal history. His attorneys said the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, considered him to be \u201clawfully present and is legally authorized to work in the United States,\u201d a status that would usually preclude a serious criminal history. \n \n Medina\u2019s attorney, Mark Rosenbaum, said his client \u201cunequivocally denies being in a gang\u201d and said \u201che was repeatedly pressured\u201d by ICE to \u201cfalsely admit affiliation.\u201d Richeson\u2019s statement, he said, \u201cis inaccurate.\u201d \n \n Lawyers allege that Medina is the first immigration action taken by the Trump administration against someone who has been allowed to stay in the country under the Obama administration\u2019s 2012 \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d (DACA) program, which deferred deportation or other adverse immigration actions against individuals who entered the U.S. illegally as children. \n \n The lawsuit alleges Medina has been in the United States since he was 7 years old. \n \n Sen. Maria Cantwell said Tuesday that she is \u201clooking into this troubling situation,\u201d and U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, blaming the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdeportation force,\u201d demanded Medina\u2019s immediate release. \n \n \u201cTrust in our government depends upon the executive branch keeping its word,\u201d said Rosenbaum, director of the Public Counsel Law Center in Los Angeles. He accused the federal government of a \u201cbait and switch,\u201d by having people register for the DACA program and then trying to deport them. \n \n Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and Councilmember M. Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez in a news release reaffirmed Seattle\u2019s place as a Sanctuary City in defiance of the Trump administration. They called for the immediate clarification of the status of Medina and whether the administration has changed its stance on the DACA recipients. \n \n In the meantime, they reiterated that \u201cno City of Seattle official will ever ask about your immigration status\u201d and police will not help ICE detain or deport immigrants \u201cwho are doing nothing more than raising their families\u201d and contributing to the city\u2019s success. \n \n But Murray warned that \u201cICE officials still have the power and jurisdiction to enter into the boundaries of Seattle and conduct their harmful actions without notifying the city,\u201d and urged immigrants to review their rights on a Facebook workshop. \n \n The lawsuit prompted a quick response by the court. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Donohue in Seattle late Tuesday issued an order requiring the government to respond to the petition by Thursday and set a hearing for Friday. \n \n The judge ordered the government to reveal whether Medina is still detained and why, \u201cgiven that he has been granted deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program?\u201d \n \n The judge is demanding immigration officials say whether he has been placed in \u201cremoval proceedings\u201d to deport him as the result of ICE\u2019s initial custody determination. If not, he asks the government to explain why he is still being held. Donohue also asks whether Medina has asked for or received a bond hearing. \n \n The lawsuit alleges the government has violated Medina\u2019s due-process rights, according to a joint news release by the Public Counsel Law Center, the Barrera Legal Group and the firm of Gibson Gunn & Crutcher, a firm with offices in Los Angeles. \n \n It seeks his immediate release and an order barring ICE from any further actions. \n \n The detention comes on the heels of controversial ICE immigration raids following the election of President Trump and his promise to deport illegal and criminal immigrants. \n \n DACA was created by Obama and provided a reprieve from deportation for those who qualify along with renewable work permits. The lawsuit alleges Medina twice had his permit renewed before his detention. It\u2019s estimated that as many as 750,000 young people \u2014 called Dreamers \u2014 have taken advantage of the program. ||||| Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, who has no criminal record, was arrested along with his father despite having received protection under Obama\u2019s Daca program \n \n US authorities have arrested an immigrant from Mexico who was brought to the United States illegally as a child and later given a work permit during the Obama administration in what could be the first detention of its kind under Donald Trump. \n \n Daniel Ramirez Medina, a 23-year-old with no criminal record, was taken into custody last week at his father\u2019s home in Seattle by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers. The officers arrived at the home to arrest the man\u2019s father, though court documents did not make clear the reason the father was taken into custody. \n \n Immigrant rights groups brace for more deportation raids: 'This is the beginning' Read more \n \n Ramirez, now in custody in Tacoma, Washington, was granted temporary permission to live and work legally in the United States under a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, established in 2012 by Barack Obama, according to a court filing. \n \n The program protects from deportation 750,000 people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, sometimes called \u201cDreamers\u201d, and gives them the temporary right to work legally in the United States. \n \n Trump has promised a crackdown on the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. A move against Daca recipients like Ramirez would represent a significant broadening of immigration enforcement under Trump. \n \n Ramirez filed a challenge to his detention in Seattle federal court on Monday, arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights because he had work authorization under the Daca program. \n \n Ethan Dettmer, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher who is one of the lawyers representing Ramirez, said he was not aware of any other Daca recipient who had been arrested. \n \n \u201cWe are hoping this detention was a mistake,\u201d Dettmer said. \n \n Another one of his lawyers, Mark Rosenbaum of the legal advocacy group Public Counsel, characterized the Daca program as a promise from the federal government\u2019s executive branch that Daca recipients would not be targeted for deportation. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe have no reason to believe that promise will be broken. This case should not see the inside of a courtroom,\u201d Rosenbaum said. \n \n Ramirez was in custody and unavailable for comment. Representatives for Ice declined immediate comment on the lawsuit. \n \n Emily Langley, a spokeswoman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Seattle, said the justice department was still reviewing the case. \n \n US immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally. The Department of Homeland Security secretary, John Kelly, said the operations, conducted in at least a dozen states, were routine and consistent with regular operations. But immigrant advocacy groups and Democrats have expressed concern that the Trump administration will escalate immigration enforcement efforts in line with the president\u2019s tough stance toward undocumented immigrants. \n \n Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, but since assuming office he has kept his public comments on Daca vague. \n \n How immigration activists mobilized to thwart deportation raids last weekend Read more \n \n In an interview with ABC News last month, Trump said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with people covered by Daca. \u201cThey are here illegally. They shouldn\u2019t be very worried. I do have a big heart. We\u2019re going to take care of everybody. We\u2019re going to have a very strong border,\u201d Trump said at the time. \n \n Under Daca, the government collected information including participants\u2019 addresses that potentially could be used to locate and deport them if the program is reversed. \n \n Ramirez was brought to the United States from Mexico in about 2001 when he was about seven, according to the lawsuit. The government granted him a Daca card in 2014 and renewed it in 2016, finding that he was no threat to public safety. He has a three-year-old son, according to the complaint. \n \n Ramirez in his lawsuit is seeking his immediate release and an injunction forbidding the government from arresting him again. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Friday. ||||| (CNN) A federal judge in Seattle on Friday declined to release from detention a 23-year-old immigrant who had been protected from deportation under Obama-era rules. \n \n Magistrate Judge James Donohue set a February 24 bond hearing for Daniel Ramirez Medina, thereby extending for a week a case that has roiled pro-immigration groups. \n \n Ramirez is originally from Mexico and had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA , his lawyers said. The program, created by President Barack Obama's executive order in 2012, is meant to shield qualified individuals from deportation. \n \n Ramirez was detained by US immigration officials in Washington state last week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Medina had admitted to being a gang member, while his attorneys denied that accusation and said he was not a threat to public safety. \n \n \"There is no basis for detaining our client,\" defense attorney Theodore Boutrous said in a press conference after the hearing. \"It is outrageous.\" \n \n The case raises questions about what it could mean for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Ramirez came to the United States when he was 7 years old and became a DACA recipient in 2014 and renewed in 2016, according to court papers filed by his attorneys. \n \n Immigration rights groups say they believe this may be the first time a Dreamer has been arrested without cause. \n \n Ramirez's lawyers have filed suit in federal court saying their client is being unlawfully held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. \n \n \"The federal government may not arbitrarily or capriciously deprive DACA recipients of these benefits, as they have here with Mr. Ramirez,\" his lawyers wrote in briefs filed in court. \n \n Differing accounts of Ramirez's history \n \n The government and Ramirez's lawyers have presented very different depictions of him. \n \n His attorneys argue Ramirez is being \"presently detained without justification\" and that he presents \"no threat to national security or public safety.\" \n \n An ICE spokesperson offered a different account. \n \n ICE said Ramirez was taken into custody \"based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety.\" \n \n Rose Richeson, an ICE spokesperson, said, \"Mr. Ramirez -- a self-admitted gang member -- was encountered at a residence in Des Moines, Washington, during an operation targeting a prior-deported felon. He was arrested February 10 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and transferred to the Northwest Detention Center to await the outcome of removal proceedings before an immigration judge with the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review.\" \n \n Mark Rosenbaum, counsel for Ramirez, disputed the ICE's characterization in a statement: \"Mr. Ramirez unequivocally denies being in a gang. While in custody, he was repeatedly pressured by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation. The statement issued tonight by Ms. Richeson of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is inaccurate.\" \n \n The conflicting stories come amid immigrant rights attorneys' fears that President Donald Trump's administration will target the Dreamers, who were temporarily allowed to live and work in the United States after passing background checks. About 750,000 people have received permission to stay under DACA. \n \n The arrest \n \n ICE agents arrived last Friday morning at Ramirez's father's house, according to the court papers filed by Ramirez's attorney. The agents had an arrest warrant for the father. The court papers allege that ICE officials asked whether Ramirez was in the state legally and he responded that he was. \n \n On the advice of his brother, who also is a DACA recipient, Ramirez declined to answer more questions. \n \n ICE agents took Ramirez to a Seattle processing center where he told them that he had a work permit. Ramirez was told by one of the ICE agents, \"It doesn't matter, because you weren't born in this country,\" according to the lawsuit. \n \n Ramirez remains in ICE's custody in Tacoma, according to court documents filed by his lawyers. \n \n Ramirez had moved from California to Washington in May. He moved with his 3-year-old son to join his father in search of better economic opportunities, according to his lawyers. \n \n ICE said that Ramirez was arrested in Des Moines, Washington, a suburb south of Seattle. His lawyers' court filing states the arrest happened in Seattle. \n \n In response to the case, Seattle's mayor Ed Murray and City Councilmember M. Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez, reiterated its sanctuary city policy. \n \n \"The Seattle Police Department will not help ICE detain or deport immigrants who are doing nothing more than raising their families and contributing to the vibrant culture and successful economy of our city,\" according to their joint statement. \n \n They're also requesting details of the arrest from Seattle's local ICE office. \n \n I join @CMLGonzalez in seeking answers about the arrest of a Dreamer in our city. Uncertainty only creates more fear https://t.co/TLw7TJDhNQ pic.twitter.com/XphztAq81N \u2014 Ed Murray (@MayorEdMurray) February 15, 2017 \n \n Outcry over detainment \n \n A small group of demonstrators gathered in Tacoma demanding Ramirez's release Tuesday. \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement: \"We should not be wasting resources on deporting law-abiding and contributing members of our communities. Dreamers represent the best of America. We must get to the bottom of this so that it doesn't happen again.\" \n \n Washington Sen.

The children had \"hardly eaten for months.\" \n \n The boys are 3 and 5 years old, and the girl is 8, authorities said, and they all exhibited bruises and signs of other physical as well as emotional abuse. \n \n The girl, who appeared to have suffered the most extreme abuse, was chained to the floor to prevent her from getting any food, they said. \n \n \"It seems that the little girl was the major target of this abuse,\" Miller continued, adding that she looked \"like a concentration camp victim.\" \n \n The girl was in the hospital for about five days, he said, and seemed \"traumatized.\" \n \n There was evidence that she was may have been put in the closet as well as that she was sometimes shackled at the ankle and at other times by a collar around her neck, Miller said. \n \n Eraca Dwan Craig, 31, and Christian Jessica Deana, 44, were both arrested at the scene on suspicion of felony child cruelty, false imprisonment and other charges. \n \n The women, who are domestic partners, do not appear to have criminal records in Monterey County.

Investigators believe she was shackled at times at the ankle and at other times by a collar around her neck. \n \n One deputy reported the girl was chained \"to keep her from obtaining food.\" \n \n Miller said it appeared she had \"hardly eaten for months.\" \n \n The girl and the 5-year-old boy were legally adopted children, he said, while the 3-year-old boy is the biological son of one of the women, who are domestic partners. \n \n The rescued 8-year-old was immediately hospitalized for about five days, Miller said, and appeared to be \"very traumatized.\" \n \n The children were placed in foster homes. \n \n \"It seems that the little girl was the major target of this abuse,\" he said. \"It was a particularly heinous case.\" \n \n He said there were indications the women were preparing to leave the area soon. \n \n Detectives said moving boxes were packed and the women told them they were planning to move to the Fresno area. \n \n Miller said when children are rescued from terrifying conditions, they are not usually \"jumping up and down in joy. They may have forgotten what joy is like.\" \n \n Law enforcement officers' description of the grim scenario stands in contrast to the women's online business profiles. \n \n Posting as Cristian Deanda-Craig on LinkedIn.Com, Deanda wrote about her cactus nursery in New Mexico: \"I am currently in a place that makes me happy both personally and professionally.

The case was ultimately thrown out for failure to pay two days before her arrest. \n \n Craig earned about $36,000 a year as a New Mexico correctional officer, according to her filing, but was receiving unemployment assistance and food stamps in Salinas at the time of her bankruptcy petition. \n \n The children were listed as her dependent sons and daughter in the filing, which was made when her youngest son was 6 months old. \n \n Neither woman appears to have a criminal record in Monterey County. \n \n Asked why his office delayed announcing the arrests, Miller said officials were investigating the case and wanted to wait until after the women were charged by the District Attorney's Office and arraigned in court. \n \n They were arraigned in Monterey County Court on Tuesday and are being held at Monterey County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each, although Miller said late Friday officers were in court asking for the bail amounts to be raised. \n \n Deanda and Craig are scheduled for a preliminary hearing on March 28. \n \n Julia Reynolds can be reached at 648-1187 or jreynolds@montereyherald.com. \n \n Donations \n \n \u00b7 Send donations to: Monterey County Association of Families Caring for Children, P.O.

At a hearing conducted last fall by a disciplinary panel established by the Canadian Judicial Council, the 19-year-old homeless complainant said Justice Camp\u2019s comment made her hate herself and feel like a slut. After the panel unanimously recommended his removal, Justice Camp went to great lengths to save his job. He publicly apologized to the complainant and his fellow judges. \n \n Justice minister on resignation of 'knees together\u2019 judge (The Canadian Press) \n \n He called his knees-together comment \u201cunforgivable,\u201d and acknowledged that he had perceived the complainant\u2019s fragility. He attended in-depth counselling and education sessions with several feminist scholars, three of whom testified at his disciplinary hearing last fall (attended daily by his wife and daughter) that he was sincerely interested in changing. \n \n Related: Before Justice Camp, these two judges were recommended for removal \n \n Unfounded: Police dismiss 1 in 5 sexual assault claims as baseless, Globe investigation reveals \n \n And he fought for an opportunity to appear in person before the larger body of judicial council members who considered the panel\u2019s recommendation, to explain to them that he had acted out of \u201cignorance, not animus.\u201d \n \n The council would receive only written submissions from him. \n \n By a vote of 19 to 4, the judicial council said in its ruling released on Thursday that the deep harm Justice Camp had done to public confidence made his dismissal necessary. \n \n \u201cWe find that the Judge\u2019s conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the Judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\u201d the council said. \n \n All four dissenters, who found Judge Camp guilty of misconduct but opposed his dismissal, are male, and from the Atlantic provinces (one is Chief Justice of the Tax Court of Canada). \n \n Alice Woolley, the president of the Canadian Association for Legal Ethics and a law professor at the University of Calgary, who, along with three other professors, filed the first complaint against Justice Camp, said she is pleased with the outcome. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would have been served by carrying this on any further,\u201d she said. \u201cThe denunciation was unequivocal. I think [resigning] was the admirable decision on his part and the right thing to do.\u201d \n \n Constance Backhouse, chair in sexual assault legislation at the University of Ottawa\u2019s law school, said rape myths are still pervasive in the justice system and society. \n \n \u201cOur legal system still remains mired in 19th-century stereotypes about women, who are suspected of duplicity, promiscuity, malice, and false testimony,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our legal thinking reflects the wider culture, which shares far too many of these notions. Until we get over the premise that it is women alone who are responsible for protecting themselves from rape, I suspect we will see more such trials and more protests demanding a woman\u2019s right to sexual autonomy.\u201d \n \n The law of consent and the judiciary\u2019s handling of sexual-assault trials continue to create controversy. In Nova Scotia, a judge acquitted a taxi driver last week of sexually assaulting a female passenger, saying \u201ca drunk can consent.\u201d That ruling is under appeal. The woman was so drunk she had urinated on herself and passed out in the back seat. \n \n Recommendations that judges in effect be fired are rare in the Canadian system, which deems judicial independence a cornerstone. Justice Camp is only the third judge whose removal has been recommended since the judicial council was established in 1971. Both of the others also resigned rather than be removed under a provision of the Constitution that requires Parliament to approve dismissing a judge. \n \n Justice Camp\u2019s comments came in the trial of Alexander Wagar in Calgary. The ruling came to light a year later, when the Alberta Court of Appeal overturned it, saying the judge had applied myths and stereotypes about sexual-assault victims. (By then, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had promoted him from provincial court.) The judicial council received scores of complaints. Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley asked for the public disciplinary hearing. \u201cOn reviewing the transcripts, I felt it was important that victims know this was not an acceptable way to be treated by the justice system,\u201d Ms. Ganley said in an e-mail to The Globe after Justice Camp resigned. \n \n Justice Camp, a father of three, received his law degree in 1975 from Stellenbosch University in South Africa, passed exams in Canada in 1998 and was admitted to the Alberta bar in 1999. In 2012, the Progressive Conservative government of Alison Redford appointed him to the Provincial Court. Before then, he practised business law in Calgary. \n \n Federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould brought a motion to the House of Commons in which she declared the government\u2019s intent to support the recommendation for removal. Shortly afterward, Justice Camp issued a brief statement through his lawyer, Frank Addario of Toronto, expressing his \u201csincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the Wagar trial.\u201d \n \n With a report from Patrick White \n \n Report Typo/Error ||||| A judge who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn't keep her \u201cknees together\u201d confirmed he will resign after the Canadian Judicial Council recommended his removal. \n \n Justice Robin Camp issued a statement Thursday in which he said he will resign from the Federal Court of Canada effective Friday. \n \n \u201cI would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,\u201d Camp\u2019s statement went on. \n \n \"I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" \n \n The Canadian Judicial Council\u2019s report called Camp\u2019s conduct \u201cso manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that the judge was rendered incapable of executing the judicial office.\" \n \n Justice Camp\u2019s lawyer Frank Addario had argued that removal was not necessary to preserve public confidence in this case. Four of the council's 23 members did not support removal. \n \n Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was in the process of moving forward on the council\u2019s recommendation in Parliament Thursday when she learned of Camp\u2019s resignation. \n \n Wilson-Raybould later told reporters that the extremely rare removal would have been needed \u201cto ensure the integrity and public confidence in the justice system and the judiciary.\u201d \n \n \u201cSexual assault and gender-based violence is in no form acceptable and we will continue to stand up for victims of sexual assault and gender-based violence,\u201d Wilson-Raybould added. \n \n Norman Sabourin, Executive Director and Senior General Council at the Canadian Judicial Council, told CTV News Channel removals are recommended when the \u201cpublic has lost confidence in a judge\u2019s ability to discharge the duties of office.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe report of the council emphasizes that all judges have to know the law but also have to possess empathy, have to understand that people who come before them are often vulnerable people and they have to treat them with a degree of civility and deference,\u201d Sabourin said. \n \n Camp, who was appointed to the federal court in 2015, faced judicial review after it was revealed that he had stated in a 2014 Alberta provincial court decision that \"pain and sex sometimes go together\u201d and asked the complainant why she didn\u2019t just \u201ckeep her knees together.\u201d He also said, \"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if they're drunk.\" \n \n Alexander Wagar was acquitted by Camp. \n \n Alberta\u2019s Appeal Court ordered a new trial and last month Wagar was again acquitted. \n \n The complainant, who was 19 at the time of the first trial, told the disciplinary hearing last year that Camp's comments had made her hate herself. She said she had contemplated suicide as a result of her experience. \n \n After Thursday\u2019s decision, the complainant said \"I was feeling so unhopeful and pretty down and not very hopeful about the justice system but it has kind of turned around by this.\u201d \n \n \u2018Watershed moment\u2019 \n \n Alice Woolley, the University of Calgary law professor who complained about Camp\u2019s conduct, said she was pleased with the decision. \n \n \u201cActors within the legal system can make really terrible decisions and terrible mistakes and in his case engage in real misconduct,\u201d she said. \n \n \u201cBut the legal system orients towards progress,\u201d she added. \u201cIt tries to get it right in the end.\u201d \n \n Kathleen Mahoney, who is also a law professor at the University of Calgary, told CTV News Channel that she believes the removal is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in how courts treat sexual assault. \n \n \u201cI think this is a very strong statement from the judges of Canada that the time has come that gender bias in these kinds of decisions will no longer be tolerated,\u201d she said. \n \n Mahoney added that she believes the case highlights the need for mandatory judicial training focusing on gendered issues such sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual harassment. \n \n The Conservatives have introduced legislation that would require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases. The justice minister agreed Thursday that judges need to be properly trained. \n \n Camp\u2019s decision is not the only recent case to raise questions about how judges handle sexual assault. \n \n In Halifax earlier this month, Justice Gregory Lenehan acquitted a taxi driver accused of sexually assaulting a passenger so intoxicated that she passed out. \n \n Lenehan said in his ruling that \u201cclearly, a drunk can consent.\u201d \n \n With a report from CTV\u2019s Glen McGregor and files from The Canadian Press ||||| Federal Court Justice Robin Camp, dubbed the \"knees together judge\" for his comments in a sex assault case, has submitted his resignation following a recommendation from Canada's judicial watchdog that he be removed from the bench. \n \n In a ruling announced Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) said that at a 2014 sexual assault trial he was presiding over, Camp \"showed obvious disdain for some of the characteristics of the regime enacted by Parliament in respect of sexual assault issues.\" \n \n \"We find that the judge's conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\" the council's ruling reads. \n \n In a statement from his lawyer, Camp announced his intention to resign and apologized. \n \n \"I have advised Chief Justice Crampton that effective March 10, 2017, I will resign as a member of the Federal Court of Canada,\" the statement read. \n \n \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the [sex assault] trial. I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" \n \n Before Camp's statement was issued, Justice Minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould rose in the House of Commons seeking unanimous consent for a motion to remove Camp from the bench, but that consent was denied. \n \n Conservative Saskatchewan MP Tom Lukiwksi then rose on a point of order and complained the minister had not ensured she had the unanimous consent of all parties before moving her motion. \n \n Votes in both the House of Commons and the Senate are required to remove a federal judge, a move presumably no longer required with Camp's resignation. \n \n Wilson-Raybould told reporters on Parliament Hill she learned of Camp's decision after she sought support for her motion. \n \n The unexpected move by the federal Justice Minister was stopped by an opposition MP 1:05 \n \n Court transcripts from the 2014 sexual assault trial show Camp, who was then a provincial court judge, called the complainant, who was homeless and 19 years old at the time of the alleged assault, \"the accused\" numerous times \u2014 a mistake he repeated at the judicial council hearing before correcting himself. \n \n Camp also told the young woman \"pain and sex sometimes go together\" and asked why she didn't just keep her \"knees together.\" \n \n 'Antithetical' to contemporary values \n \n The judge apologized several times for those comments, underwent counselling and took additional training on Canada's sexual assault laws. \n \n But that wasn't enough for the CJC. \n \n \"The statements made by Justice Camp during the trial and in his decision, the values implicit in those statements and the way in which he conducted himself are so antithetical to the contemporary values of our judicial system with respect to the manner in which complainants in sexual assault cases should be treated that, in our view, confidence in the system cannot be maintained unless the system disassociates itself from the image which the judge, by his statements and approach, represents in the mind of a reasonable member of the public,\" wrote the majority. \n \n Parliament considers training for judges \n \n NDP MP Murray Rankin said that by resigning, Camp took the only course of action available in light of the conclusions of the judicial council. \n \n Rankin added that Camp's case bolsters a private member's bill by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose to ensure judges know Canada's sexual assault laws. Parliament voted unanimously this week to send that bill to committee for further study. \n \n Ambrose, in a statement welcoming the council's ruling, said her bill was designed to hold the judiciary responsible for the ongoing training of its judges. \n \n \"Unfortunately, there is not enough accountability on the part of the judiciary in ensuring that judges have the updated training Canadians expect them to have. This needs to change,\" Ambrose said in the statement. \n \n Until Thursday, Camp had fought hard to keep his job. \n \n He asked to speak directly to the 23 chief and associate chief justices who make up the CJC. But the majority said Camp had already \"been fully and fairly heard,\" and declined saying nothing had changed since his public hearing last fall. \n \n Camp then asked the Federal Court to stop the judicial council from deliberating his fate and to review an earlier decision he be dismissed. His lawyer Frank Addario argued the judicial council should consider the fact that Alexander Scott Wager, the man who was accused of sexual assault in the original trial, had once again been acquitted. The judge refused to stall the CJC. \n \n Since the council's creation in 1971, no judge has gone to such lengths to keep his job. There have only been two other cases where the council recommended Parliament remove a judge from the bench and in both cases the men resigned almost immediately. \n \n Just like any other judge facing discipline, Camp's legal battle has been paid for by taxpayers through the Commission for Federal Judicial Affairs, which has refused to say how much it has cost so far. \n \n Four judges dissented from the majority and said Camp should not lose his job because he has rehabilitated himself through counselling and further education.",

    "document": "Three happy marriages, beginning to crack; three dissatisfied blondes; and, crawling out from the cracks, the thought of violent crime. Such is the substance of three new films, all derived from works by popular authors. The longest is \u201cGone Girl,\u201d adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own novel; the most nattily dressed is \u201cThe Two Faces of January,\u201d taken from Patricia Highsmith; and last, courtesy of Georges Simenon, comes \u201cThe Blue Room,\u201d the Frenchest of the three, so much so that the plot relies on confiture de prunes. \n \n \u201cGone Girl,\u201d directed by David Fincher, starts with Nick (Ben Affleck)\u2014in his own words, \u201ca corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth Missouri boy.\u201d He used to live in New York and write for magazines, but the work dried up and he returned home, to the uneventful town of North Carthage, with his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike). According to your point of view (and the film is all about viewpoints, and the urge to shuffle them around), Amy is one or more of the following: the inspiration for the \u201cAmazing Amy\u201d series of children\u2019s books, written by her parents; a flat-out dazzler, too cool for the neighborhood; a rich kid, spawned by a snotty family; the original desperate housewife, becalmed and unadored; or a heap of trouble\u2014the Clytemnestra of the Midwest. Oh, and another thing. She may be dead. \n \n Nick owns a bar with his twin sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), and he stops there one morning for an early Scotch. He then drives home to find the front door open, a glass table smashed, and no sign of his wife. Their cat is a witness, but, if it knows anything, it\u2019s not coughing up. The police arrive, and Detective Boney (Kim Dickens) declares a missing-persons case; before long, Nick is knee-deep in press conferences, candlelit vigils, and public appeals, flashing a polite, reluctant grin that is parsed, by tabloids and TV hosts, as proof of guilt. (You can\u2019t blame them. The Affleck smile, from the dawn of his career, has looked more creepy than consolatory\u2014softening that firm, all-American jaw but never quite reaching the eyes.) Suddenly, after an hour, we flip to Amy, and to her version of what happened\u2014so different, and so close to wacko, that it seems like another story altogether. I would happily unveil the rest of it, but, in deference to the twenty-one people who have yet to read the novel, I will say nothing more without a lawyer present. \n \n At first blush, \u201cGone Girl\u201d is natural Fincherland. Not geographically; he seems less absorbed in North Carthage, described by Amy as \u201cthe navel of the country,\u201d than he was in the California of \u201cZodiac\u201d or the Harvard of \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d Those are his masterpieces: the two movies that I can\u2019t not watch when they turn up on TV, and the two occasions on which his pedantry and his paranoia have fused together, engrossing us in a crazed aggregation of detail. Nothing could equip him better for the coiled and clustered goings on in the new film, and, for good measure, he has hired Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whom he last used for \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d to compose the score. They don\u2019t let him down. \u201cGone Girl\u201d boasts one major act of savagery, drenched in a downpour of blood, and what we hear during it sounds like the wah-wah pedal of Satan. So why doesn\u2019t the movie claw us as \u201cThe Social Network\u201d did? Who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a Web site? \n \n The glum fact is that \u201cGone Girl\u201d lacks clout where it needs it most, at its core. We are accustomed to Fincher\u2019s heroes being as obsessively smart as he is, if lacking his overarching patience, whereas Nick remains, to put it gently, a lunkhead. Amy has twice the brain, and ten times the cunning, but, despite the best efforts of Rosamund Pike, her character, onscreen as on the page, feels cooked up rather than lived in. That can work on film, as shown by another beauty, Gene Tierney, in \u201cLaura\u201d and \u201cLeave Her to Heaven,\u201d but the scheming of Tierney\u2019s heroines was matched by a rare, ornate febrility in the movies themselves. Fincher\u2019s method, on the other hand, is dogged and downbeat, so that Amy sticks out like a cartoon in a newsreel. (One expected the same of the title character in \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d who was equally extreme, but somehow Rooney Mara gave her life\u2014all drilled intensity where Pike offers elegant drift.) \u201cGone Girl\u201d is meant to inspire debates about whether Amy is victimized or vengeful, and whether Nick deserves everything he gets, but, really, who cares? All I could think of was the verdict of Samuel Butler on Thomas Carlyle: \u201cIt was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four.\u201d Or, in the words of Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), Nick\u2019s unflappable attorney: \u201cYou two are the most fucked-up people I have ever met, and I specialize in fucked-up people.\u201d \n \n Perry has a grand time. His wave to the press corps, camped out on Nick\u2019s sidewalk, is a cool mixture of dismissal and salute. He knows that our attention is straying from the main couple toward the outlying figures: Tanner himself, Detective Boney, and, best of all, Margo\u2014a fine performance, both grounded and wounded, from Carrie Coon. Against that, we have Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), a wealthy ex of Amy\u2019s, wandering in as if from another film, and eating up the final slice of the action with a silly Gothic subplot. It comes straight from the novel, and you can picture the outcry if Fincher had chopped or changed it, but so what? A director\u2019s task is not to suck up to readers, or to flatter his source, but to imagine it afresh, as film, while seizing on those aspects that matter to him most. What grabs Fincher about \u201cGone Girl,\u201d I suspect, is not the mystery in Missouri but the sight of a media wolf pack in full cry. Hence the time that he devotes to two cable-TV hosts, played by Sela Ward and Missi Pyle, who rifle through Nick\u2019s privacy, and his state of mind, in their lust for a story. Fincher is right: these days they are the story, and I wish that he would tell it again from their angle, through the eyes of bloggers, and via the phones of the people we see laughing outside Nick\u2019s bar, taking selfies at a hot spot of fame. So, \u201cGone Girl Redux\u201d: the campaign starts here. ||||| Even with the well-established praise for director David Fincher as a master filmmaker \u2014 his movies lushly drenched in shadow, his capacity for tough stuff matched only by his care in presentation \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget or overlook his sense of humor, the spoonful of sugar that helps the malevolence go down in his films. \n \n At his best, Fincher has a sense of humor that not only cuts through the darkness but actually contrasts it to significant effect. After the dour, sour, sadistic Scandanavian misfire of \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d it\u2019s a pleasure to note that Fincher\u2019s latest adaptation, of Gillian Flynn\u2019s best-selling novel of the same name, is both wicked and wickedly fun. \n \n Not only brutal but also brutally funny, \u201cGone Girl\u201d mixes top-notch suspenseful storytelling with the kind of razor-edged wit that slashes so quick and clean you\u2019re still watching the blade go past before you notice you\u2019re bleeding. \n \n See video: New \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 Trailer Suggests That Ben Affleck Murdered His Wife (Video) \n \n Like some mix of \u201cScenes from a Marriage\u201d and \u201cAce in The Hole\u201d as shot by Michael Mann with a Hitchcock Blonde to kill (or die) for in the lead, \u201cGone Girl\u201d tells the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). The film begins in New Carthage, Mo., on their fifth anniversary; Nick runs a few errands and blows off some steam, returning home to find an empty house, an upended coffee table shattered in the living room, and no sign of Amy. \n \n When the cops (played by the superb Kim Dickens and a mostly silent but excellent Patrick Fugit) arrive, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s been a struggle inside the Dunne\u2019s house; as Nick and Amy narrate their marriage to us and the police investigate an ever-increasing number of clues, though, it\u2019s clear there were signs of struggle inside the Dunne\u2019s marriage as well. \n \n Made up of police inquiries and diary entries, love stories and other fake-outs, \u201cGone Girl\u201d is, in no small part, a story about storytelling and the difference between perception and reality, with comforting tales interrupted by the low, ominous thud of the metaphorical other shoe dropping. Amy\u2019s mom and dad are best-selling authors of children\u2019s books, with their series \u201cAmazing Amy\u201d an improved version of their daughter\u2019s life; Nick and Amy\u2019s American dream marriage with the big house and the big love looks is utterly perfect until you shake it and the rot comes spilling out. \n \n Also read: Tyler Perry\u2019s \u2018For Better or Worse\u2019 Fall Premiere Draws Best Ratings Since OWN Series Debut \n \n And when upsetting revelations come out in the case, celebrity defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry, a natural as a hearty, likable cynic with great media presence) smoothly states how \u201cWe\u2019ll have to \u2026 realign the public\u2019s perception \u2026\u201d \n \n Flynn\u2019s script is loaded with nicely-tuned observations, not just about the rules and rituals of the modern American marriage but also about a media that shrieks speculation more than it speaks the truth and worries about slogans more than facts. The author\u2019s clever, cruel and cool work also gives Pike the role of a lifetime in the shining, secretive Amy, while still making her human and comprehensible. Affleck, who\u2019s personally had to endure a level of media scrutiny that makes a colonoscopy look dignified, brings much of that history to Nick\u2019s affability and desire to please. When he needs to play the part, Nick does, but he\u2019s not as smart as he thinks he is. Both performers are brilliant. \n \n Also read: Ben Affleck Admits to Being Really Good at Counting Cards in Blackjack \n \n With its shifting perspectives and timelines, its constant conflict between what\u2019s said and what\u2019s truly seen, \u201cGone Girl\u201d is clean, clear, and perfectly constructed. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and editor Jeff Baxter, both regular Fincher collaborators, deliver the kind of work that looks easy but, assuredly and on reflection, is decidedly not. The score, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is a more mixed proposition, effective in the places it works and distracting on several occasions where it doesn\u2019t. \n \n The supporting cast is a thing of wonder \u2014 there are familiar faces like Dickens, Fugit, and Perry all pushed to greatness, with Missi Pyle perfect as the film\u2019s version of harridan-for-justice Nancy Grace, Neil Patrick Harris elegantly worrisome as on old suitor of Amy\u2019s, and Carrie Coon (\u201cThe Leftovers\u201d) a revelation as Nick\u2019s loving, tough sister Margot. \n \n Also read: 7 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall 2014 \u2013 From a \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 to a \u2018Maze Runner\u2019 \n \n The best Hitchcock films struck a balance between elegance and violence, a peculiar mix of champagne fizz and spilled crimson blood; \u201cGone Girl,\u201d with its giddy revelations and grim-grin reversals incorporating ugly facts and uglier fictions, fits perfectly into a modernized version of that superb tradition. \n \n \u201cGone Girl\u201d portrays marriage not just as warfare by other means but as many different kinds of battle \u2014 class conflict, sexual gamesmanship, wrangling over money, fighting over the future \u2014 with plenty of blood spilled. That\u2019s part of what makes it as damned good as it is; \u201cGone Girl\u201d is that rare entertainment that rewards your intelligence instead of insulting it, that rare thriller interested in emotional wounds as much as physical ones. \n \n \u201cGone Girl\u201d will earn plenty of loud shouts of applause, awed sounds of surprise, and shocked laughter, but what makes it worthy of them is all the hushed, uneasy conversations it\u2019s guaranteed to inspire in the long, unsettled silence to come after. ||||| 'Gone Girl\u2019 review: thrilling until it\u2019s not \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); \n \n \n \n window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-7', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 7', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Photo: Merrick Morton / Associated Press Image 1 of / 7 Caption Close Image 1 of 7 Ben Affleck stars as Nick, who beomes a suspect when his wife goes missing in \u201cGone Girl.\u201d Ben Affleck stars as Nick, who beomes a suspect when his wife goes missing in \u201cGone Girl.\u201d Photo: Merrick Morton / Associated Press Image 2 of 7 In this image released by 20th Century Fox, Rosamund Pike appears in a scene from \"Gone Girl.\" The film, based on the best-selling novel, will release on Oct. 3.

Until then it\u2019s brilliant, not just a triumph of story but of strategy, a movie that keeps the audience grasping and reaching in all the wrong directions, while consistently delivering something a little better, a little crazier and a little more disturbing than expected. \n \n And then before it\u2019s over, it all kind of goes ... not to hell \u2014 it\u2019s not as bad as that \u2014 but to purgatory, or limbo. This most satisfying of films turns dissatisfying. This Swiss watch of storytelling turns into a bad digital clock circa 1986, flashing the wrong numbers. If only the dip in quality came in the middle, or even at the beginning, we might still be able to class \u201cGone Girl\u201d as among the year's best. But when a movie, in its final minutes, forsakes its own logic and embraces false cleverness, that can\u2019t be ignored. \n \n \u201cGone Girl\u201d is based on Gillian Flynn\u2019s enormously popular novel of the same name, and the novel\u2019s very popularity might be the main problem here. There are things that can work in print that just can\u2019t be made to work onscreen. Yet when it\u2019s an acclaimed story that half the audience will know going in, no broad changes can be considered, even ones for the better. \n \n Latest entertainment videos Now Playing: Now Playing Parents Prank Kids With Light Bulb and Ironing Board on Christmas Eve Storyful \n \n Jessica Alba Welcomes Third Child with Cash Warren InStyleTime \n \n New Year 2018 accidents already brings death, injury and destruction Euronews_News \n \n Las Vegas Rings in 2018 Under Unprecedented Security TMTime \n \n Kevin McCarthy has the movies to look forward to in 2018 Fox5DC \n \n 'Real Housewives' Star Going To Rehab Following Arrest Buzz60 \n \n 'Real Housewives' Star Going To Rehab Following Arrest Veuer \n \n Does this all sound vague? Alas, we\u2019re going to have to hover in the Land of Vague in discussing \u201cGone Girl,\u201d because this is just one of those movies: Give away too much of the story, and you\u2019ve just killed about three-quarters of its appeal. \n \n Story of marriage \n \n So we\u2019ll stay general. \u201cGone Girl\u201d is the story of a marriage, as well as a pretty straight-faced satire \u2014 or is it an indictment? \u2014 of the way gossip is passed off as news on cable television. Ben Affleck plays Nick, a guy with a cloud of sadness around him, who goes home to find that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), is missing and that there are signs of a struggle. He calls the police, who, being cops, start suspecting him of murder. But who knows? This time they could be right. \n \n For the first hour, \u201cGone Girl\u201d takes place on two tracks. It follows Nick in the present day, as he becomes the center of both the investigation and of the media\u2019s piranha-like lust. And it goes back in time, telling the tale of Nick and Amy\u2019s courtship and marriage as related (and narrated) by Amy in her diary. \n \n Juicy roles \n \n Affleck has had good roles before, but I don\u2019t think he has ever had one that capitalizes on as much of what he can do onscreen. He is a big slab of a guy, but his aura is not of strength, but of uncertainty, perhaps moral weakness. He is instantly likable and then occasionally, upon reflection, dislikable. He has a blitheness that is either amusing or engaging or off-putting, depending on the viewer's angle. He can just as easily charm the world as irritate millions \u2014 he has literally done both, in real life \u2014 so anybody\u2019s reaction to him is easy to believe, so long as it's extreme. \n \n Rosamund Pike will come as more of a surprise. Her previous roles have hinted at her intelligence and ability \u2014 she even made audiences believe she was in love with a cigar-chomping Paul Giamatti in \u201cBarney\u2019s Version\u201d \u2014 but this is the juiciest role she has had to date, and she makes a meal of it. Everyone who sees \u201cGone Girl\u201d will walk out raving about Rosamund Pike. \n \n Director David Fincher lands a tone for \u201cGone Girl\u201d that\u2019s broad and precise enough to encourage a series of witty performances within the thriller framework. The story may be the star here, but everyone is vivid within it, not just the principals, but Kim Dickens as a detective, Tyler Perry as a hotshot lawyer and Carrie Coon as Affleck's twin sister. \n \n And then it all sort of ... \u201cimplodes\u201d would be too strong a word. Perhaps \u201cfrays?\u201d \u201cBecomes dented?\u201d \u201cLoses its glow?\u201d But that\u2019s all in the last 20 minutes. Try to put it out of your mind for those first two hours. \n \n Mick LaSalle is The Chronicle\u2019s movie critic.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Chilling,\" \"unsettling,\" and \"manipulative\" is what critics are saying about Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy, a husband and wife trying to make it in a small town in Missouri\u2014just the type of descriptors you probably want for a mystery-thriller about what happens when Nick becomes a suspect in Amy's sudden disappearance. Here's what the critics have to say: For Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle, the movie starts off \"brilliant, not just a triumph of story but of strategy,\" and maintains that momentum throughout \u2026 until the last 20 minutes. That's when LaSalle says the movie \"frays\"\u2014a \"Swiss watch of storytelling [that] turns into a bad digital clock circa 1986, flashing the wrong numbers.\" He praises the acting, especially that of Pike, proclaiming that \"everyone who sees Gone Girl will walk out raving about\" her. Manohla Dargis is similarly thrown off by the shift midway through the film, writing for the New York Times that \"by the movie's second half, you may wish that Amy would stay gone.\" Although Dargis concedes that David \"Fincher's compositions, camera work, and cutting are, as always, superbly controlled,\" she adds that the film \"plays like a queasily, at times gleefully, funny horror movie about a modern marriage.\" But evenutally, \"dread descends like winter shadows, darkening the movie's tone and visuals until it's snuffed out all the light, air, and nuance.\" James Rocchi writes at The Wrap that Fincher's humor is \"the spoonful of sugar that helps the malevolence go down in his films,\" and Gone Girl is no exception, with \"top-notch suspenseful storytelling\" and \"razor-edged wit.\" He also lauds the supporting cast (including Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry) as \"a thing of wonder\" and praises the movie overall as \"that rare entertainment that rewards your intelligence instead of insulting it, that rare thriller interested in emotional wounds as much as physical ones.\" But Gone Girl isn't as alluring as Fincher's The Social Network, laments Anthony Lane in the New Yorker, asking: \"Who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a website?\" The film that Lane at first calls \"natural Fincherland\" soon devolves into a movie that \"lacks clout.\" He also can't help but note that Gone Girl is \"meant to inspire debates about whether Amy is victimized or vengeful, and whether Nick deserves everything he gets, but, really, who cares?\"",

    "document": "We've seen this movie before: a frenzied buildup punctuated by constant speculation. And then Apple actually announces the object behind all the fuss \u2014 in this particular sequel the latest iPad, which goes on sale Friday. \n \n Then the mood shifts. People bummed out by the features that Apple did not put into its freshly baked tablet computer weigh in. No extra storage or expansion options, no smaller-screen model to compete against the likes of Amazon's Kindle Fire. Still no Adobe Flash, and no camera flash, either. Not even Siri, the chatty personal assistant who, depending on where you are coming from, either charms owners of the iPhone 4S or bugs them. \n \n No big deal. \n \n Apple may have left a few things out. But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster estimates Apple will sell up to 60 million iPads this year. And that's on top of the 55 million collectively Apple has sold since the original iPad was introduced in 2010, spawning imitators and redefining an entire category of computing. \n \n And nearly everyone who lands the brand new iPad on Day 1 \u2014 or more likely sometime afterward, since preorders are sold out \u2014 will be delighted. \n \n Apple's latest tablet strongly resembles the iPad 2. At 0.37-inches and 1.4-pounds, it's ever-so- slightly thicker and heavier (though Apple says most cases and accessories should fit). But the new iPad snatches the crown from its predecessor as the finest tablet you can buy. Period. Similar scenes played out last year with the iPad 2. \n \n So it goes with the tablet born in 2012, which Apple for reasons not altogether clear did not name iPad 3 but simply the new iPad. On the surface, the leap from the second-generation iPad to the third-generation would appear to be relatively modest. But all Apple did was again distance itself from the competition: \n \n \u2022An overview. The display is spectacular. Apple also improved the camera, added dictation and, on some models, the ability to tap into the speediest available cellular networks. Apple did all this without sacrificing much battery life or jacking up prices. The iPad 2 stays in the lineup and is cheaper. \n \n An iPad 2 with 16 gigabytes of storage now fetches $399, $100 less than a week ago. An iPad 2 with 3G wireless capabilities from AT&T Wireless and Verizon Wireless goes for $529, plus a data plan if you choose to add one. \n \n Meanwhile, new models with just Wi-Fi cost $499 for 16GB, $599 for 32GB and $699 for 64GB. Same capacity models with Wi-Fi and 4G wireless capabilities command $629, $729 and $829. \n \n \u2022Fast wireless. The new iPads are the first iPads that access the 4G or 4th generation data networks being deployed nationally (but not everywhere) by AT&T and Verizon Wireless, each with variations on how wireless is delivered. \n \n The test machine, a Verizon model that taps into the company's 4G LTE network, was really zippy in a week of testing in San Francisco and Austin. Downloading apps was quick, including previously purchased apps that had to be accessed through Apple's iCloud service. Web pages loaded much faster than on an older iPad running 3G. \n \n The new iPad can work as a personal hotspot that lets you share your speedy wireless connection with up to five other devices, though for now only Verizon has turned on the feature. \n \n Verizon's monthly data plans begin at $20 for 1 GB, go to $30 for 2 GB and climb to $80 for 10 GB. AT&T offers a 250 MB plan for $14.99; 3 GB for $30; and 5 GB for $50. Keep in mind that with 4G you might well consume more data. \n \n To some degree, Apple is playing catch-up, because many of the tablets built around Google's Android mobile operating system have had 4G for some time. \n \n Where Apple continues to claim a huge advantage over Android and other tablet rivals is in the apps ecosystem. The iPad runs almost all of the 585,000-plus apps sold or available free in the App Store, and more than 200,000 apps now are designed specifically for the iPad. Android still has comparatively few tablet-specific apps. \n \n \u2022A screen to die for. The display becomes your window into all those apps. And the brilliant screen on the new iPad is the thing that will have you salivating. \n \n You're probably thinking the displays on the first iPad and the iPad 2 were pretty sweet, and you'd be right. Watching movies, reading books, surfing the Web, playing games and admiring photos on the older tablets is not an unpleasant experience. \n \n But then you have a look at what Apple calls the \"retina display\" on the new iPad, technology first applied to recent iPhones, and you're blown away. \n \n Examine the new screen side-by-side with one of its near-10-inch predecessors, and you'll swear you just had Lasik surgery. Text on Web pages or in books is so crisp and sharp that you don't want to go back to reading on an older iPad. Movies and photographs reveal rich detail. \n \n Apple explains that with a resolution of 2048x 1536, and 3.1 million pixels (four times the number on the iPad 2) the screen on the new iPad is sharper than your high-definition television. The company's marketers are using the word \"resolutionary.\" \n \n Apple helps drive the spectacular display with a new version of one of its chips, the A5X, with quad-core graphics. Even Apple goes all geeky on you every now and then. \n \n \u2022Photos and video. Last time around, Apple added those two cameras to the iPad 2; this time Apple souped-up the optics. \n \n There's an autofocus, 5-megapixel iSight camera, which unlike the camera on the iPad 2 can capture high-definition video up to the 1080p standard. (Movies also play back in full high-def.) The camera has face detection, a sensor that performs well in low light, a fixed f/4 aperture and other optical enhancements. \n \n Taking a lot of pictures or videos with the iPad is a matter of preference. It's not exactly a point-and-shoot replacement and is a little awkward for shooting. Held a certain way, you can sometimes inadvertently cover the lens when pressing the onscreen shutter button. The alternative is to take pictures by pressing a volume button on the side. \n \n But the still images and video shot are generally pleasing, despite the absence of a flash. You can do minor edits inside the built-in Photo app and easily tweet images you've shot from within the app. Apple is also pushing a custom $4.99 iPad version of the iPhoto software that is familiar to Mac owners \n \n If you shoot video and are prone to shake, you'll appreciate the built-in video-stabilization feature that helps steady your footage. And even if you don't plan on shooting much, many apps take advantage of the cameras on the iPad. \n \n \u2022Dictation. Apple may have kept Siri off the iPad's roster for now, but it did add a dictation feature that lets you use your voice to create notes, e-mails or to write something in Apple's optional Pages word-processing app, or for that matter any Apple or third-party app in which you summon the virtual keyboard. \n \n You tap a microphone icon and start speaking, then tap again when you're done. The iPad almost always spits out results right away, but doesn't always hear correctly. For example, the word \"maybe\" was heard as \"baby.\" \n \n But more often than not the accuracy was decent enough that it wouldn't take long to manually fix errors. Even the commas were typically put in the right places. \n \n \u2022The battery. Apple claims up to 10 hours for the Wi-Fi-only models, same as before, and nine hours for 4G and about an hour less for Wi-Fi + 4G. \n \n The iPad got through an entire day of being worked hard with no battery problem. Inside the device is a larger capacity (and physically larger) sealed battery than the one in the iPad 2. \n \n The third-generation iPad may not be the game-changer that Apple's original tablet was, but you know how this movie is going to end. Apple is going to rake it in on the heels of its latest matinee idol. \n \n Should you buy the new iPad? \n \n If you purchased the original iPad all of two years ago and have money to spare, I'd say go for it. Though a tad bigger than the iPad 2, the new iPad is smaller and lighter than the original iPad. You'll appreciate the increased speed, the lovely screen and the presence of cameras. \n \n If you have an iPad 2, it's a little harder to justify springing for the latest model now, much as you might want to. Yes, the new screen is spectacular, and 4G and the improved cameras are welcome upgrades. But you would have purchased that iPad 2 much more recently and it may be difficult to plunk down extra cash this soon, unless you have a family member who can inherit your current model. \n \n If you're a tablet newbie, there's no better choice on the market than an iPad, provided \u2014 and this is a pretty big if \u2014 price isn't an issue and you don't want a tablet that would fit in your pocket, such as the $199 Amazon Kindle Fire. \n \n The bottom line \n \n www.apple.com \n \n $499 on up. \n \n \u2022Pro.

Photo: Getty Images. \n \n Apple's iPad could be described as a personal display through which you see and manipulate text, graphics, photos and videos often delivered via the Internet. So, how has the company chosen to improve its wildly popular tablet? By making that display dramatically better and making the delivery of content dramatically faster. \n \n There are other changes in the new, third-generation iPad\u2014called simply \"iPad,\" with no number, which goes on sale on Friday at the same base price as its predecessor, $499. But the key upgrades are to those core features\u2014the 9.7-inch screen and the data speed over cellular networks. These upgrades are massive. Using the new display is like getting a new eyeglasses prescription\u2014you suddenly realize what you thought looked sharp before wasn't nearly as sharp as it could be. \n \n Boosting those particular features\u2014the screen and the cellular speed\u2014usually has a negative impact on battery life in a digital device. But Apple has managed to crank them up them while maintaining the long battery life between charges that has helped give the iPad such an edge over other tablets. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Walter S. Mossberg/The Wall Street Journal Objects, like the trees in this photo of Glacier National Park in Montana that Walt made his screen wallpaper, look sharper on the new iPad. \n \n That doesn't mean there aren't other trade-offs. Mostly to make room for a larger battery, the new iPad weighs about 8% more and is about 7% thicker than the prior model. That means the company can't claim to have the thinnest and lightest tablet, as it boasted last year with the iPad 2. (It's still thinner and lighter than the original iPad.) \n \n I've been testing the new iPad, and despite these trade-offs, its key improvements strengthen its position as the best tablet on the market. Apple hasn't totally revamped the iPad or added loads of new features. But it has improved it significantly, at the same price. \n \n It has the most spectacular display I have ever seen in a mobile device. The company squeezed four times the pixels into the same physical space as on the iPad 2 and claims the new iPad's screen has a million more pixels than an HDTV. All I know is that text is much sharper, and photos look richer. \n \n If you already own an iPad 2, and like it, you shouldn't feel like you have to rush out to buy the new one. However, for those who use their iPads as their main e-readers, and those who use it frequently while away from Wi-Fi coverage, this new model could make a big difference. \n \n The optional, extra-cost, 4G LTE cellular-data capability made it feel like I was always on a fast Wi-Fi connection. I loved the photos and videos I took with the greatly improved rear camera. And the battery life degraded by just 11 minutes, a figure that is still much better than on any tablet I've tested. \n \n Along with the unmatched collection of 200,000 third-party programs designed for its large screen, and the large catalogs of music, books, periodicals and video content available for it, I can recommend the new iPad to consumers as their best choice in a general-purpose tablet. \n \n The exceptions would be people who prefer a smaller size for one-handed use, or those who find the weight a burden. While the weight gain was noticeable, I didn't find it a problem even for long reading or video-watching sessions. The extra thickness was barely discernible. \n \n For the weight conscious, and for those who can't swing the $499 entry cost, there is an out. Apple for the first time is making and selling the prior iPad model at a reduced price. The iPad 2 will now be available starting at $399, with just one choice of storage capacity\u201416 gigabytes. The new iPad can be bought in 16, 32 or 64 GB capacities, at prices up to $829. The optional cellular capability costs the same as the slower 3G capability, both up front and in monthly fees from Verizon and AT&T . \n \n The Display \n \n It's not as if people are complaining about the screens on their iPads, a device so attractive and useful that Apple sold about 55 million of them in two years. But this display is a big leap forward. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Apple Letters that seemed sharp on the iPad 2, far left, suddenly felt fuzzier when compared with the new iPad's 'retina' display, left. (It's hard to reproduce on a web page.) \n \n It's hard to illustrate on a Web page or in print how brilliant this new display is. You have to see it. Apple calls it a \"retina\" display because, at normal viewing distance, there are so many pixels per inch, the human eye can't pick them out individually. This display packs 264 pixels into every inch, twice as many as on iPad 2. Overall, the resolution is 2048 x 1536, versus 1024 x 768 for the iPad 2. \n \n My epiphany came when I placed my iPad 2 next to the new model, with the same text on the screen. Letters and words that had seemed sharp on the older model five minutes earlier suddenly looked fuzzier. \n \n As I tested the new model over five days, I found I was able to use smaller font sizes to read books and email. The same photos I had enjoyed on the older model looked much better on the new one, not only because of the increased resolution, but because Apple claims it increased color saturation by 44%. One thing Apple hasn't fixed: like all glossy, LCD color displays, this one still does poorly in direct sunlight. \n \n The Speed \n \n Walter S. Mossberg/The Wall Street Journal The new iPad's 4G LTE cellular speeds are faster than many home Internet connections, as seen in this speed test showing how fast it would take to download data. \n \n The new iPad is hardly the first device to use 4G LTE cellular technology, but it marks a huge difference from the iPad 2. On Verizon's network in Washington and Austin, Texas, I averaged LTE download speeds of over 17 megabits per second, faster than most home wired networks. A colleague using a new iPad on AT&T's LTE network averaged over 12 mbps. My iPad 2 running Verizon's 3G network averaged just over 1 mbps. Of course, you can get a Wi-Fi only model, at $130 less. The base $499 model is Wi-Fi only. \n \n There is another dimension to speed: the overall responsiveness of the device. The new iPad is just as buttery smooth to use as the iPad 2. Apple beefed up the processor, especially its graphics capabilities. \n \n The Battery \n \n Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life between charges, and up to nine hours if you are relying strictly on cellular connectivity. In my standard battery test, where I play videos back to back with both cellular and Wi-Fi on, and the screen at 75% brightness, the new iPad logged 9 hours and 58 minutes, compared with 10 hours and 9 minutes for the iPad 2. Other tablets died hours sooner in the same test. In more normal use, the new iPad lasted more than a full day, though not as long as the iPad 2 did. \n \n The Rear Camera \n \n Like the iPad 2, the third-generation iPad has front and rear cameras. The front camera, meant mainly for video chats, hasn't changed. But the rear camera, which was awful for photos on the iPad 2, and was estimated at less than a single megapixel of resolution, has greatly improved. It's now a 5-megapixel shooter with improved optics. I loved the photos and videos it took, indoors and out. \n \n Other features \n \n The new iPad is the first that can be used, like many smartphones, as a personal hot spot\u2014a base station to connect laptops and other devices to the Internet. In my tests, this worked fine. \n \n It also allows you to dictate, rather than type, emails and other text. I found this surprisingly accurate. And Apple now has a brilliant new version of its iPhoto software that has been rewritten for the iPad. \n \n Bottom Line \n \n Since it launched in 2010, the iPad has been the best tablet on the planet. With the new, third-generation model, it still holds that crown. \n \n \u2014 Find all of Walt Mossberg's columns and videos at walt.allthingsd.com. The Personal Technology column will return to Wednesdays next week. \n \n Write to Walter S. Mossberg at mossberg@wsj.com ||||| But apps that haven\u2019t been rewritten don\u2019t benefit as much. In most apps, text is automatically sharpened, but not in all of them. After enjoying the freakishly sharp text in Mail and Safari, you\u2019ll be disappointed in the relatively crude type in, for example, the non-updated Amazon Kindle app. (Amazon says that a Retina-ready update is in the works.) \n \n Similarly, high-definition videos look dazzling. This is the world\u2019s first tablet that can actually show you hi-def movies in full 1080p high definition. But Netflix\u2019s streaming movies don\u2019t come to the iPad in high definition (yet, says Netflix), so they don\u2019t look any better. \n \n There\u2019s another price you\u2019ll pay for all this clarity, too: in storage. Tests performed by Macworld.com revealed that the graphics in Retina-ready apps consume two to three times as much of the iPad\u2019s nonexpandable storage than pre-Retina apps. To update their apps for the new display, software companies must redo their graphics at much higher resolution, which means much larger files. \n \n (Worse, each app is usually written in single, universal version for all iPad models. So those apps will eat up the same extra space, pointlessly, on older iPads, too \u2014 and even on iPhones, since many apps are written to run on both the tablet and the phone. In other words, iPhone owners, too, will wind up losing storage space because of this graphic-bloat ripple-down effect.) \n \n The resolution revolution isn\u2019t the only change in the iPad That Shall Not Be Numbered. Another big change is 4G LTE. \n \n That is, the cellular iPad models can now hop onto the very fast 4G wireless networks for data that Verizon and AT&T have built in big American cities. \n \n (Apple has not changed the prices and configurations for the new iPad. The base model still costs $500, has only Wi-Fi and holds 16 gigabytes. The top-of-the-line model still costs $830, has 64 gigabytes of storage and can also get online via a cell network. You have to choose either the AT&T or the Verizon model, in that case, and pay a monthly fee \u2014 $15 to $50 a month, no contract required. These iPads can also get online overseas, although only at 3G speeds; LTE uses different frequencies in other countries.) \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Being on LTE flavor of 4G is really, really nice. Apps download quickly. Web pages appear fast. You don\u2019t have to wait for videos to load before they start playing. The Verizon iPads offer tethering \u2014 a feature that converts that cellular Internet connection into a Wi-Fi hot spot \u2014 so nearby laptops can now enjoy the same high Internet speeds. (AT&T says it\u2019s working to get tethering.) \n \n My Verizon test unit got download speeds ranging from 6 to 29 megabits a second in San Francisco, Boston and New York \u2014 in many cases, faster than home cable-modem service. According to tests by PC Magazine and others, AT&T\u2019s 4G network is smaller, but often faster. No doubt about it: life begins at 4G. \n \n Photo \n \n Now, 4G is a notorious battery hog. It scarfs down electricity like a football team at a hot dog eating contest. \n \n Apple, however, was determined to keep the iPad\u2019s battery life unchanged from the last model: nine to 10 hours on a charge. In my all-day nonstop-usage test, it did manage nine hours. \n \n To pull that off, Apple adopted a three-prong strategy. First, it developed or adopted components that use less power (Bluetooth 4.0, for example). Second, it came up with various software and circuitry tricks. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

It\u2019s a very slight difference, but fingers used to handling the old iPad will feel it, and that\u2019s too bad. \n \n Interestingly, you can turn off the LTE antenna in the Settings app. Without that power hog, you\u2019ll probably get even better battery life. \n \n So what else is new? A 5-megapixel back camera that takes far better photos than the iPad 2 did. (Which isn\u2019t saying much.) You can capture 1080p hi-def videos now, and a stabilization feature lends a hand when yours is shaky or moving. \n \n A tiny microphone now appears on the on-screen keyboard. Tapping it lets you speak to type, exactly as on the iPhone 4S. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n For most people, that\u2019s a huge blessing; typing on glass has never been a joyous activity. The recognition is fast and accurate, at least when you have a strong Internet connection (the transcription is actually performed by faraway servers). \n \n Weirdly, though, speech-to-text is the only piece of Siri, Apple\u2019s smart voice-control software, that the new iPad inherits from the iPhone 4S. You don\u2019t get the rest of Siri\u2019s features: the ability to set alarms, send text messages, look up calendar appointments and snag facts from the Web just by asking out loud. That the full Siri isn\u2019t available smacks more of a marketing department holdback than technical limitations. \n \n The world has changed since the iPad 2 came out. Stripped-down, smaller and far less magical rivals like the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet cost only $200. (That, probably, is why Apple still sells the iPad 2 at $100 less than the new models.) \n \n Dozens of would-be iPads have come \u2014 and, in many cases, gone. (Shall we have a moment of silence for the Hewlett-Packard TouchPad and the flailing BlackBerry PlayBook? Nah.) \n \n But the surviving rivals still sell in minuscule numbers compared with the iPad, and that\u2019s not likely to change now. \n \n The new iPad doesn\u2019t introduce anything that we haven\u2019t seen before, either in the iPhone or in rival tablets. There\u2019s no Steve Jobs \u201cone more thing\u201d moment here; Apple just took its white-hot iPad and added the latest screen, battery and cellular technologies. \n \n If you\u2019re in the market for a tablet, here\u2019s the bright side: For the same price as before, you can now get an updated iPad that\u2019s still better-looking, better integrated and more consistently designed than any of its rivals. \n \n And if you already have the iPad 2, here\u2019s an even brighter side: At least this time around, you don\u2019t have to feel quite as obsolete as usual.",

The North usually denounces any such exercises as a rehearsal for war. \n \n Robert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea's Pusan National University, told the BBC that the Winter Olympics statement was \"a smart move from North Korea\" as it positioned Mr Kim's regime as moving towards its neighbours while the US was seeking to isolate it. ||||| North Korean leader Kim Jong Un boasted in an annual New Year's Day speech Monday that he had a nuclear button on his desk and that the entire United States was within range of his weapons \u2014 but he also vowed not to attack unless threatened. \n \n Kim promised to focus this year on producing nuclear warheads and missiles for operational deployment. But he also struck a conciliatory note, opening the door to dialogue with South Korea and saying he would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held in his southern neighbor in February. \n \n \"The United States can never fight a war against me and our state,\" he said in the nationally televised speech. \"It should properly know that the whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office, and this is just a reality, not a threat.\" \n \n But Kim also said that North Korea was a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power, and would not use its nuclear weapons unless \"hostile aggression forces\" encroach on its sovereignty or interests. \n \n \"This year, we should focus on mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,\" Kim said. \"These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.\" \n \n North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September and launched its most high-tech intercontinental ballistic missile in November, ignoring international condemnation and steadily tightening sanctions. \n \n [Documents shed light on North Korea\u2019s startling gains in sea-based missile technology] \n \n In typically bellicose language, it declared the latest round of United Nations sanctions imposed last month an \"act of war,\" and Kim said his country had achieved the historic feat of \"completing\" its nuclear forces. \n \n North Korea's nuclear capabilities do not yet match Kim's boasts, experts say, since it is far from clear it could successfully deliver a nuclear weapon on one of its missiles. Yet there is little doubt its capabilities have advanced significantly in the past year. \n \n But Kim, dressed in a Western-style gray suit and tie, also offered a potential olive branch to Seoul, saying it is imperative to lower military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and improve ties with the South. \n \n He said that the path to dialogue was open and that he would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeong\u00adchang, South Korea. \n \n \"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people, and we wish the Games will be a success,\" he said. \"Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility.\" \n \n South Korea has been trying to reassure the rest of the world that the Olympics will be safe despite the nuclear tensions, and President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea's participation would ensure their safety.

    "document": "How Much Water Actually Goes Into Making A Bottle Of Water? \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Steven Depolo/Flickr Steven Depolo/Flickr \n \n Environmental activists have long claimed that bottled water is wasteful. Usually, they point to the roughly 50 billion (mostly plastic) bottles we throw away every year. \n \n The International Bottled Water Association, ever sensitive to criticism that it's wasting precious resources, has commissioned its first ever study to figure out how much water goes into producing one liter. The results, released this month, show that for North American companies, it takes 1.39 liters to make one liter of water. \n \n That's less than the global averages of a liter of soda, which requires 2.02 liters of water. A liter of beer, meanwhile, needs 4 liters of water, wine demands 4.74 liters. Hard alcohol, it turns out, is the greediest, guzzling 34.55 liters of water for every liter. \n \n This, the bottled water industry says, is evidence that its product isn't so bad. \"Bottled water products are extremely efficient in terms of water use compared to some other packaged beverages,\" says Chris Hogan, spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association. \n \n But water activists say the IBWA study highlights a problem throughout the beverage industry: Few companies take the whole water-use picture into account when calculating their water use. Just as companies are beginning to calculate their carbon footprint, they also need to analyze their water footprints to find opportunities for conservation. \n \n Bottled water companies (along with many other beverage companies) should include the water in their supply chain, says Ertug Ercin with the Water Footprint Network. Ercin says a true water footprint includes all freshwater used in production, including the water used for packaging. \n \n \"Packaging makes a significant footprint,\" he says, adding that three liters of water might be used to make a half-liter bottle. In other words, the amount of water going into making the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle. \n \n Drilling for oil to make plastic, Ercin says, uses a substantial amount of groundwater. And you need water to make the paper, too, he adds. \n \n Still, Ercin notes, bottled water packaging uses far less water than soda, which needs extra water to grow sugar and make dyes. \n \n Hogan says that one reason why the IBWA didnt look at these issues is that it's hard to know where to stop. \"You could extrapolate that ad infinitum,\" he says. \n \n Hogan says some companies say they don't think they can get any more efficient, but they're trying. \"Water,\" Hogan says,\" is the lifeblood of the industry and they want to be as efficient as possible.\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

It arrived at that figure by asking its members to submit three years of detailed data, touching on factors like total water use and the type of treatment used. Writes IBWA, \"The study represents 14.5 million liters of bottled water production, an impressive 43% of total 2011 United States bottled water consumption.\" That figure applies to US and Canadian companies, and a rep for the group actually calls that \"extremely efficient.\" NPR explains why: A liter of soda demands 2.02 liters of water, while the same quantity of wine requires 4.74 liters. The IBWA chose to stop there in its calculations, but the truth is that the actual \"water footprint\" is much larger: For instance, oil is needed to make plastic, and drilling for it requires, yep, water\u2014in some cases as much as seven times what the plastic bottle ultimately contains.",

That added more time to the sentence he was serving for the rape and abduction conviction that was thrown out Monday. \n \n Gonzalez was released Tuesday night after the property charge was dismissed, Vanessa Potkin, a senior attorney with the Innocence Project, told NBC News. \n \n Potkin said Gonzalez told her the first thing he wanted to do was \"hug my mother and thank her for being there.\" \n \n \"It was very hard when you don't understand what is going on. She always believed in me,\" Potkin quoted Gonzalez as saying as he drove to his family's home. \n \n Gonzalez's younger brother Saul said the wrongful conviction that took Gonzalez away hit him very hard because he the two often did things together. \n \n \"The family is so excited. Everyone is so excited. Everything is moving so fast. We haven't had time to think about this,\" Saul, 34, said in a telephone interview. \n \n He said his mother, Maria, quickly started handing out tasks to everyone. \"Go pick up this and go pick up fried chicken and fix this,\" Saul said, describing her orders. \n \n Gonzalez also has two sisters, and Saul said he would be introducing his children, ages 11 and 5, to their uncle for the first time. \"All the kids are decorating with balloons,\" said Saul, who visited his brother one to three times a month during his time in prison when he was old enough to do so. \n \n Gonzalez was jailed for a 1994 rape and abduction of a woman who had identified him as her attacker. But DNA testing returned profiles belonging to two other men and did not connect Gonzalez to the crime. \n \n The Innocence Project found other problems with the investigation and with Gonzalez's conviction, which forced a re-examination of his case and brought about the new DNA testing of evidence from the crime scene. \n \n In addition, Immigration and Customs Enforcement canceled what is known as a detainer, which would have required that he be turned over to ICE custody after he finished serving his sentence. The detainer was placed on Gonzalez on Aug. 20, 1995. \n \n \"Since Mr. Gonzalez has been exonerated on all charges, ICE is exercising prosecutorial discretion and has canceled his detaineer,\" said Gail Montenegro, an ICE spokeswoman. \n \n Follow NBC News Latino on Facebook and Twitter \n \n The Gonzalezes are originally from Mexico. An ICE spokeswoman referred questions about Angel Gonzalez's future immigration status to Citizenship and Immigration Services, which was considering the question late Tuesday. \n \n Although wrongly imprisoned, Gonzalez used his time in prison to educate himself and learn skills. He is an artist and mentored other younger prisoners and helped those who spoke Spanish. \n \n \"He was always studying in school and teaching other inmates,\" Saul said. \n \n Saul remembered that about five years before Gonzalez's arrest, his brother also was teaching him. His fondest memory has been of the two swimming in Mexico and riding a bike, he said. \n \n \"He showed me how to swim and he taught me how to ride a bike,\" Saul said. \n \n But Saul said his brother is now ready to learn from him. \"I told him I drive a truck. He said, 'You are going to show me now.'\" \n \n Video interview by Telemundo correspondent Janet Rodr\u00edguez and photographer Cesar Gonz\u00e1lez ||||| Lake County prosecutors plan to exonerate a man who has spent 20 years in prison for rape and abduction, a move that would lengthen the list of the county's criminal convictions wiped away by DNA evidence. \n \n State's Attorney Mike Nerheim said he will go to court Monday afternoon and ask a judge to throw out the conviction of Angel Gonzalez, who has been serving a 55-year sentence for a 1994 rape and abduction in Waukegan. \n \n The crime involved two suspects, and DNA test results that arrived late last week showed the presence of bodily fluids from two men, both of whom remain unidentified, Nerheim said. The prosecutor said it was \"very clear\" that the evidence indicates that Gonzalez, now 41, is innocent and contradicts the confession he gave and the victim's identification of him as one of her rapists. \n \n Gonzalez, who is incarcerated at Dixon Correctional Center in northwestern Illinois, was speechless at first when he learned last week that prosecutors planned to clear him, said Vanessa Potkin, an attorney from the Innocence Project in New York who has represented him with the help of the Illinois Innocence Project at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Barry Scheck, co-founder and co-director of the New York group, said Gonzalez voiced sympathy for the victim and said he hoped that the perpetrators would be caught. \n \n Gonzalez has maintained his innocence for decades, Potkin said. \n \n \"He's obviously anxious and excited to see his family again,\" she said. \n \n If Monday's court hearing proceeds as planned, Gonzalez's conviction would be the fifth major felony case to collapse in the last five years after DNA indicated Lake County authorities had put an innocent man behind bars. Gonzalez, who lived in Waukegan, was tried during the 22-year tenure of State's Attorney Michael Waller, who retired in 2012 following revelations that prosecutors had disregarded forensic evidence that contradicted their conclusions and worked to prevent men from walking free even after DNA had indicated their innocence. \n \n It is not clear whether Gonzalez will be freed after his scheduled appearance in Lake County court. He is a Mexican national who had once obtained a visa, but that expired after he was arrested, Potkin said. Attorneys have been working to try to make sure Gonzalez can remain in the country if he's freed, Potkin said. \n \n Deporting him upon his release would be \"a huge travesty of justice,\" she said, since he planned to seek citizenship before he was imprisoned. \n \n \"It's only the wrongful conviction that makes his status in the country illegal at this point,\" Potkin said. \n \n Gonzalez also was convicted in the late 1990s of criminal damage to state property and has not served his three-year sentence for that crime, according to prison records. That charge stemmed from an accusation that he destroyed a sink while in solitary confinement in prison, Potkin said. Nerheim said Friday afternoon he hoped Livingston County prosecutors would agree to have that conviction wiped away. \n \n The rape victim, Nerheim said, was distraught to learn of prosecutors' plan to clear Gonzalez. \n \n \"She is completely devastated about this,\" Nerheim said. \n \n On the night of July 10, 1994, the victim, then 35, heard the door buzzer at her home in Waukegan, according to court records and Tribune archives. She opened the door to two men and asked what they wanted. One of the men said, \"You,\" and they dragged her to a sedan and drove away, according to court records. \n \n She was driven to another location, pulled from the car and raped in some bushes by Gonzalez, she testified at trial. She ran and hid, but the second man quickly found her and raped her, according to a transcript. After the attack, court records show, she walked to a convenience store and called police. \n \n Early the next morning, police stopped a vehicle matching the description of the car the woman gave and detained the driver, Gonzalez, court records show. An officer testified that Gonzalez matched the description the woman had given of one of her attackers. \n \n The victim was summoned to the scene of the traffic stop, where she identified Gonzalez as her attacker as he was illuminated in the dark by headlights, according to court records. \n \n \"He was wearing the same clothes, everything. I recognized him immediately,\" the victim testified. \n \n At trial, prosecutors presented a videotaped statement from Gonzalez in which he acknowledged participating in the assault but said he didn't ejaculate, according to court records. \n \n DNA tests at the time on semen taken from the victim and her clothing were inconclusive. Despite his confession, Gonzalez presented an alibi at trial, saying he'd been with his girlfriend at the time of the attack, court records show. \n \n Gonzalez, who had no felony record at the time, was found guilty of sexual assault and kidnapping, court records show. He continued to maintain his innocence, and a judge sentenced him to 55 years in prison, according to court records. \n \n In the early 2000s, tests determined that some of the forensic material from the victim matched an unidentified man other than Gonzalez, according to court records. But judges ruled that the new DNA was not conclusive because Gonzalez said he did not ejaculate and could still could have been one of the two men who participated in the crime. \n \n More recent DNA testing revealed distinct genetic profiles of two men, neither of whom is Gonzalez, Nerheim said. The identity of the two men is unknown. \n \n Scheck and Potkin said the evidence against Gonzalez was never solid. Witnesses' identifications have been proven fallible, and some experts regard the type of \"show-up\" procedure by which the victim identified Gonzalez as unreliable. The lawyers said there were discrepancies between the description the victim gave police and Gonzalez's appearance. \n \n Gonzalez confessed after some 13 hours in custody, Potkin said, and court records indicate there were also discrepancies between the confession and the victim's account of the attack. \n \n Asked about her client's mindset, Potkin said Gonzalez \"has kept his humanity and his hope and is so thankful.\" \n \n Gonzalez wrote to the Innocence Project for years before the group took his case in 2012, Potkin said. Nerheim agreed to new testing in 2013, according to court records, and now plans to reopen the case. \n \n Nerheim took office promising reform, and he's faced criticism for not clearing other people who claim innocence. Scheck praised the prosecutor for his plan to act promptly on the DNA. \n \n \"Lake County, unfortunately, was infamous for its resistance to ... DNA evidence,\" Scheck said. \"This is exactly the opposite.\" \n \n Tribune reporter Lisa Black contributed. \n \n dhinkel@tribpub.com ||||| A Waukegan man walked out of prison Tuesday evening, nearly 20 years after he was convicted of a rape and abduction that authorities now say he did not commit. \n \n Angel Gonzalez, who spent about half of his life incarcerated for the Lake County conviction, hugged his attorneys at the Dixon Correctional Center gatehouse before emerging a free man. \n \n \"I'm free,\" he said. \"Thank God.\" \n \n Lake County authorities cleared Gonzalez of the rape conviction on Monday after determining that new DNA testing of evidence eliminated him as the one of the two men who committed the crime. But he was not freed right away because he still had a property damage conviction on his record, stemming from an incident in which he broke a sink while in solitary confinement in prison, his lawyers said. \n \n They went to court earlier Tuesday in downstate Livingston County, where a judge agreed to void that charge, paving the way for his release hours later. \n \n At about 7 p.m., Gonzalez, wearing a new dark gray track suit, walked out into an early evening fog that shrouded the prison. After raising his arms with his lawyers and staff from the Innocence Project in New York, he appeared jovial as he spoke with the assembled media. \n \n The 41-year-old Gonzalez thanked his family, his supporters, his lawyers and the criminal authorities who worked for his release. \n \n Gonzalez said he had no reason to be angry: \"The past is the past.\" \n \n Angel Gonzalez Jr., of Waukegan, walked out of prison March 10, 2015, nearly 20 years after he was convicted of a rape and abduction that authorities now say he did not commit. \n \n Now, he looks forward to learning and continuing with his hobby of painting. \n \n \"To be here today is making me feel alive again,\" he said. \n \n Before leaving for the long-awaited trip home to Waukegan, he said that years in prison can make it feel like \"no one believes in you.\" \n \n One of his attorneys, Lauren Kaeseberg, from the Illinois Innocence Project, said: \"He never gave up, and we've always believed in him.\" \n \n Gonzalez's lawyers had argued that the property damage conviction, for which he received a three-year sentence, to be served after he completed his 55-year term for the rape, should also be wiped away. They noted that the property crime occurred when he was in prison for a wrongful conviction, and also that Gonzalez, who speaks limited English, pleaded guilty to damaging the sink without the assistance of an interpreter. \n \n \"Right now, everybody is saying, finally, there is justice for him,\" said Angel's younger brother, Saul Gonzalez, 34. \"Finally, this is over.\" \n \n Angel Gonzalez, who was exonerated Monday of a 1994 rape and abduction in Waukegan, was cleared of property damage charges and will be freed from prison. His family shares their reaction to the events. (Stacey Wescott, Chicago Tribune) Angel Gonzalez, who was exonerated Monday of a 1994 rape and abduction in Waukegan, was cleared of property damage charges and will be freed from prison. His family shares their reaction to the events. (Stacey Wescott, Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS \n \n The family was planning a party with his favorite foods, like chile relleno and fish, to make up for all the family events that Angel missed, said his mother, Maria Gonzalez, 67, speaking in Spanish. Those included siblings' weddings and the births of five nieces and nephews, the family said. The children, the eldest of whom is 11, asked about their missing uncle at every family event. \n \n On Monday, a Lake County judge vacated Gonzalez's conviction for the abduction and rape of a woman in Waukegan in July 1994. State's Attorney Mike Nerheim agreed to ask for Gonzalez's freedom after recent DNA tests showed that bodily fluids collected as evidence had come from two men, neither of whom was Gonzalez. Nerheim, who took office long after Gonzalez was convicted, said it was clear that this indicated he wasn't guilty and that two other men, who have yet to be identified, committed the crime. \n \n Nerheim apologized for the case outside court, striking a markedly different tone than his predecessor, Michael Waller, who generally remained unapologetic in public as DNA repeatedly indicated he had sent innocent men to prison. Five rape or murder cases have collapsed in Lake County since 2010; DNA cleared all the men, but they spent a combined 80 years behind bars. Prosecutors under Waller, who held the office for 22 years, were responsible for Gonzalez's prosecution and three of the other convictions. \n \n In several cases, the prosecutor's office under Waller fought for years to prevent inmates from going free after DNA had suggested their innocence, and his office attracted unflattering national attention as prosecutors proposed alternate theories of the crimes that many found implausible. \n \n Nerheim took office promising reform after Waller retired in 2012. \n \n Gonzalez's relatives said they never doubted his innocence, Saul Gonzalez said, but they wondered if they would see him vindicated after spending thousands of dollars over the years for his defense. Their efforts seemed to be wasted until the Innocence Project took over, he said. \n \n \"We were thinking when he went to jail it was a mistake and he'd get out,\" Gonzalez said Tuesday afternoon, as his mother proudly displayed early family photos. \"But everything went wrong.\" \n \n Saul Gonzalez worried most of all that his parents wouldn't live to see the day Angel was released. Their father, Angel Gonzalez Sr., 68, had a stroke last year after spending years working in a factory. \n \n \"I wanted them to see him out (of prison) before they passed away,\" Saul Gonzalez said. \n \n He answered phone calls all day Monday and Tuesday, as family and friends from California and Texas reacted with excitement after hearing that the charges were dropped. \n \n His sister went shopping for clothes for Angel on Monday, he said. \n \n \"He's kind of scared right now,\" said Saul Gonzalez, who on Sunday reassured his brother that his family will help him readjust to life outside prison. \"He's seen many bad things. He says he's lucky he's not crazy. He says thank God for everything. He says he's lucky to be alive.\" \n \n While in prison, Angel obtained his high school diploma and learned skills in electronics, mechanics, window-washing, construction and auto mechanics, his brother said. He also painted pictures, including a Mother's Day card with an iris set between two hearts. \n \n \"The hardest part is over,\" Saul Gonzalez said. \n \n Following Angel Gonzalez's exoneration in Lake County, another issue threatened his prospects for immediate release: his immigration status. His lawyers said he had a visa in 1994 but that it expired after Gonzalez, a Mexican national, was arrested. One of his lawyers, Vanessa Potkin, from the Innocence Project in New York, said she was informed Tuesday that an immigration hold on Gonzalez had been lifted, allowing him to remain in the country as he seeks citizenship. \n \n dhinkel@tribpub.com \n \n lblack@tribpub.com",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The wife of an Alabama state senator helps run his Facebook account, so she's plenty familiar with all the women sending her husband come-hither photos and messages. \"NO MORE!\" wrote Heather McGill on Facebook on Monday night, in a diatribe spotted by Gawker. \"It is a shame that people are so heartless that they would try to split up families,\" wrote McGill, who warned that she's going to start publicly naming people if it continues (though she noted that these women \"may not even be real\"). Husband Shadrack says he supports his wife's post and tells Al.com that it also stems from some real-life incidents during his last campaign\u2014including one in which two strippers showed up at the family's home late one night. He also says his Facebook page got \"hijacked\" more than once, and \"women sent me pictures of themselves half-naked, saying, 'I had a great time last night with Shadrack McGill.' That sort of thing.\" His wife wants to put an end it to it all, he says. (The last time the lawmaker made headlines was when he cited \"Biblical principle\" to argue against giving raises to teachers.)",
