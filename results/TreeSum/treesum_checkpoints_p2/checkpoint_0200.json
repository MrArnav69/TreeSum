    "document": "GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney leads President Obama by 3 points nationally, according to the closely watched Gallup daily tracking poll. \n \n Romney takes 50 percent to Obama's 47 in the poll of likely voters, released Thursday. That\u2019s unchanged from Wednesday\u2019s daily tracking poll. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Obama, meanwhile, retained his 1-point advantage over Romney among registered voters in the survey, 48-47. \n \n The survey is a rolling seven-day average through Oct. 24, so it completely encapsulates polling data since the second presidential debate last Tuesday night, Oct. 16, in Hempstead, N.Y., but includes only two days of reaction to Monday night\u2019s foreign-policy debate in Boca Raton, Fla. \n \n Gallup has received a lot of attention, as Romney\u2019s lead among likely voters had been outsized in comparison to other polls. For most of the last week, Romney led Obama by between 5 and 7 points in the poll. \n \n \n \n \n \n According to the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, Romney leads Obama by less than 1 percentage point, 47.7 to 47.1 \n \n \n \n \n \n An Associated Press-GfK poll released Thursday shows Romney edging Obama, 47-45. \n \n But battleground polls show many states remain a toss-up. \n \n In Ohio, a key state for both campaigns, a Time poll released Wednesday showed Obama up 5, with a 49-44 advantage, while a SurveyUSA poll showed the president topping Romney by 3. \n \n A poll from conservative outlet Rasmussen put the two candidates tied in the Buckeye State, with 48 percent support apiece among likely voters. \n \n The Gallup daily tracking poll has a margin of error of 2 percentage points. ||||| Our Services \n \n We empower you to use data for real transformation. Through analytics and advice, we provide leaders with a road map for understanding and unlocking the full potential of individuals, teams and organizations. ||||| The term \u201cmomentum\u201d is used very often in political coverage \u2014 but reporters and analysts seldom pause to consider what it means. \n \n Let me tell you what I think it ought to mean: that a body in motion tends to stay in motion. That is, it ought to imply that a candidate is gaining ground in the race \u2014 and, furthermore, that he is likely to continue to gain ground. \n \n As a thesis or prediction about how polls behave, this notion is a bit dubious, especially in general elections. In races for the United States Senate, for instance, my research suggests that a candidate who gains ground in the polls in one month (say, from August to September) is no more likely to do so during the next one (from September to October). If anything, the candidate who gains ground in the polls in one month may be more likely to lose ground the next time around. \n \n (Where might there be clearer evidence for momentum, as I\u2019ve defined it? In primaries, especially when there are multiple candidates in the race and voters are behaving tactically in choosing among them. But there is little evidence of it in general elections.) \n \n The way the term \u201cmomentum\u201d is applied in practice by the news media, however, it usually refers only to the first part of the clause \u2014 meaning simply that a candidate has been gaining ground in the polls, whether or not he might continue to do so. (I\u2019ve used this phrasing plenty of times myself, so I have no real basis to complain about it.) \n \n But there are other times when the notion of momentum is behind the curve \u2014 as it probably now is if applied to Mitt Romney\u2019s polling. \n \n Mr. Romney clearly gained ground in the polls in the week or two after the Denver debate, putting himself in a much stronger overall position in the race. However, it seems that he is no longer doing so. \n \n Take Wednesday\u2019s national tracking polls, for instance. (There are now eight of them published each day.) Mr. Romney gained ground in just one of the polls, an online poll conducted for Reuters by the polling organization Ipsos. He lost ground in five others, with President Obama improving his standing instead in those surveys. On average, Mr. Obama gained about one point between the eight polls. \n \n Photo \n \n This is the closest that we\u2019ve come in a week or so to one candidate clearly having \u201cwon\u201d the day in the tracking polls \u2014 and it was Mr. Obama. \n \n The trend could also be spurious. If the race is steady, it\u2019s not that hard for one candidate to gain ground in five of six polls (excluding the two that showed no movement on Wednesday) just based on chance alone. \n \n What isn\u2019t very likely, however, is for one candidate to lose ground in five of six polls if the race is still moving toward him. In other words, we can debate whether Mr. Obama has a pinch of momentum or whether the race is instead flat, but it\u2019s improbable that Mr. Romney would have a day like this if he still had momentum. \n \n The FiveThirtyEight model looks at a broader array of polls \u2014 including state polls \u2014 in order to gauge the overall trend in the race. \n \n Our \u201cnow-cast\u201d also finds a slightly favorable trend for Mr. Obama over the course of the past 10 days or so. Mr. Romney\u2019s position peaked in the \u201cnow-cast\u201d on Friday, Oct. 12, at which point it estimated a virtual tie in the popular vote (Mr. Obama was the projected \u201cwinner\u201d by 0.3 percentage points). As of Wednesday, however, Mr. Obama was 1.4 percentage points ahead in the \u201cnow-cast,\u201d meaning that he may have regained about 1 percentage point of the 4 points or so that he lost after Denver. Mr. Obama\u2019s chances of winning the Electoral College were up in the FiveThirtyEight forecast to 71 percent on Wednesday from 68.1 percent on Tuesday. \n \n It\u2019s not yet clear how much of this, if any, has to do with the final presidential debate in Florida this Monday, which instant polls regarded Mr. Obama as having won. Instead, it\u2019s been more of a slow and unsteady trajectory for him, with Mr. Obama often taking two steps forward but then one step back. It\u2019s also not out of the question that the apparent trend just represents statistical noise. \n \n At the same time, there is more reason to take a potential change in the polls seriously if it is precipitated by a news event like the debate. The tracking polls that were released on Wednesday contained only one full day of interviews that postdated the Florida debate. If the debate moved the needle toward Mr. Obama, it should become more apparent in the coming days. \n \n The battleground state polls that came in on Wednesday were generally very close to our model\u2019s current projections. For instance, there were three Ohio polls published on Wednesday; one showed a tied race there, while the other two showed Mr. Obama ahead by margins of two and five points.That\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019d expect to see out of a trio of Ohio polls if Mr. Obama\u2019s lead there were about two points, which is where our model now has it. \n \n Some of the polls, especially the Time magazine poll which had Mr. Obama five points ahead in Ohio, seemed to set off a lot of discussion on Twitter, as though people were surprised that Mr. Obama still held the lead there. \n \n But these polls are really nothing new. Since the Denver debate, Mr. Obama has held the lead in 16 Ohio polls against 6 for Mr. Romney. In Nevada, Mr. Obama has had the lead in 11 polls, to Mr. Romney\u2019s 1. Mr. Obama has led in all polls of Wisconsin since the Denver debate, and he has had five poll leads in Iowa to one for Mr. Romney. \n \n Part of the confusion (and part of the reason behind the perception that Mr. Romney is still gaining ground in the race) may be because of the headlines that accompany polls. \n \n We\u2019re still getting some polls trickling in where the most recent comparison is to a poll conducted before the Denver debate. We should expect Mr. Romney to gain ground relative to a poll conducted before Denver. (Mr. Romney may have lost a point or so off his bounce, but he has clearly not lost all of it). But it isn\u2019t news when he does; Mr. Romney\u2019s Denver gains had long ago become apparent, and priced into the various polling averages and forecast models. \n \n The question, rather, is whether Mr. Romney is gaining ground relative to the post-Denver polls \u2014 or if, as Wednesday\u2019s polls seemed to imply, the race instead may have ticked back slightly toward Mr. Obama.",

    "document": "I\u2019m a bit obsessed with fortune cookies. I, an otherwise non-superstitious person, have no fewer than five incidentally meaningful ones stashed away in special places. I know I shouldn\u2019t take them seriously \u2014 they\u2019re not even Chinese! \u2014 but breaking open a cookie and attempting to find a higher truth is an inexplicably satisfying way to end a takeout meal. But just eating them wasn\u2019t enough. I wanted to unlock their mysteries. \n \n Sure, we know how fortune cookies are made, but I wanted to break inside the dough and find out what could be learned from the wisdom within: the fortunes, the \u201clucky numbers\u201d and even the lessons in Mandarin. So in the spirit of this earlier experiment with tarot cards, I set out on a data-driven mission. \n \n I bought 1,050 fortune cookies from an internet wholesaler. A week later, the FiveThirtyEight offices welcomed three bulk boxes of the purportedly portentous pastries; within yet another week, after assiduous disassembly, categorization, alphabetization and digitization, I was able to say with resounding confidence: Those jerks only sent 1,035 cookies. Despite the 15-cookie deficit, I had an intimidating sample size to crack wide open. Here\u2019s what I found. \n \n How many fortunes are there? \n \n I bought the bulk cookies \u2014 Panda brand, with fortunes at times directing me to Wonton Food Inc.\u2019s web page \u2014 expecting a random sample, but it turns out that buying in bulk gives you an entire slice of a production run. I bought enough that we got fortunes beginning with the letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cI,\u201d and letters \u201cW\u201d through \u201cY.\u201d There were 676 unique fortunes in the 1,035-cookie sample. The obverse side of the fortunes repeat more often; there were just 556 unique combinations of lucky numbers on the back of those fortunes, and 173 individual Mandarin vocabulary words and phrases. \n \n We can estimate a few things with this information. We know the general distribution of letters in the English language, but we also know the approximate distribution of first letters in sentences, thanks to cryptographers who need to keep such information handy. About 46 percent of sentences begin with the letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cI,\u201d and about 8 percent begin with \u201cW\u201d through \u201cY.\u201d And while the fortune cookie distribution differs from most English in a number of ways \u2014 for instance, way more sentences beginning with \u201cYou\u201d \u2014 I\u2019d venture, given our 54 percent coverage, that there could be roughly 1,200 to 1,600 fortunes in the overall corpus. So we\u2019re far from a census here, but we have a decent sample. \n \n Are fortune cookie \u201clucky numbers\u201d actually lucky? \n \n Lucky? Don\u2019t be ridiculous, of course they\u2019re \u2014 \n \n It\u2019s complicated. \n \n In order to figure out if one set of six numbers was legitimately luckier than a random set of six numbers, we would need some sort of highly transparent, public-facing random number generation system carried out over years and years at organized intervals with specific monetary amounts allocated to specific chance outcomes. The logistics alone would be breathtaking. Such a study of luck could easily require a multi-state body to organize the venture and ensure that the game remained solvent. \n \n We only worked on this story for about a month, so instead of setting all that up, we let Powerball do the work for us. I took all the lucky numbers from the fortunes and compared them to the Powerball numbers stretching from Nov. 1, 1997, to May 27, 2017, and calculated what the winnings would be if a degenerate gambler bought one Powerball ticket for every single one of the allegedly lucky number combinations over all 2,043 drawings. Such an individual \u2014 buying one ticket for each batch of numbers, including repeats \u2014 would make $4.4 million on $4.2 million in ticket purchases. The expected value of that investment using \u201cunlucky\u201d randomized digits and assuming an average jackpot at each drawing? $1.7 million in winnings on $4.2 million in ticket purchases, based on multiplying the current probabilities of each event by the current prizes for each event across 2,043 drawings. \n \n It would appear that the lucky numbers are legit lucky: \n \n Obviously, this is weird as hell. It\u2019s mainly thanks to several $1 million prize-winning jackpots with the numbers 19, 30, 55, 18 and 53 with the Powerball number 21. There are certainly logical explanations for this. Maybe the lucky numbers were added into the fortune cookies after those Powerball wins. Or, according to Occam\u2019s razor, play several thousand lotteries with several thousand combinations, and you\u2019ll hit a winner eventually. Plenty of people have won lotteries, even the Powerball, with fortune cookie insight. \n \n So I can\u2019t say they\u2019re lucky, but I\u2019m pretty confident we can\u2019t claim the numbers are unlucky . \n \n How much of the language can one learn from the backs of fortunes alone? \n \n Anyone who tried to pick up Mandarin from our 1,035 fortunes in some bootleg flashcard stratagem would be in decent luck. At 173 words, we\u2019re talking the vocabulary of a highly precocious 2-year-old or a late-blooming toddler. You won\u2019t be carrying on any particularly insightful conversations; with 21 verbs at your disposal \u2014 mostly exercise-, eating- and illness-based \u2014 an adept student could eat, find a doctor and roller-skate (assuming tenses are no object). Intensifiers and modifiers are very much in the cards; with 21 adjectives in your arsenal, you could order that food cheap, delicious or even blue. It\u2019s with the 124 nouns that your vocabulary range sings \u2014 assuming you\u2019re hungry. \n \n Seventy-four of the 173 words you\u2019d learn pertain primarily to food, so the cookie has educated you just enough to keep you trapped in a restaurant. We\u2019re talking lesson two, maybe three of the Mandarin Rosetta Stone set. If you can\u2019t bear the course cost, downing 1,035 snacks with the approximate nutritional value of Froot Loops could do the trick. \n \n But what are the fortunes telling us? \n \n Only about a fifth of fortunes had predictive or forward-looking statements about what may or will occur in the misty future, but a majority hit the most delightful topic of all: you. Based on some laborious topical tagging, more than half of the unique fortunes mentioned \u201cyou,\u201d your character, your strengths, your weaknesses. Outside of those two main themes, there was not a ton of consensus in terms of topics covered (again, I coded these by hand). \n \n Fortune cookies aren\u2019t really about the future; they\u2019re all about you THEME SHARE OF FORTUNES Mentions \u201cyou\u201d 52.9% \u2013 Predicts the future 22.3 \u2013 Success, failure and happiness 10.0 \u2013 Work, education and doing things 8.1 \u2013 Intellect, curiosity and creativity 7.6 \u2013 Character traits 7.3 \u2013 Journeys, beginnings and change 6.9 \u2013 Friends and people 4.8 \u2013 Love, beauty and romance 4.0 \u2013 Chance, fortune and fate 3.7 \u2013 Based on an analysis of 676 unique fortunes from 1,035 Panda brand fortune cookies, which were not quite sampled randomly. All fortunes begin with the first letter \u201cA\u201d through \u201cI\u201d or \u201cW\u201d through \u201cY\u201d because of the way the cookies were packaged for bulk purchasing. \n \n Are all the fortunes innovative and unique? Of course not. I have qualms about \u201cEveryone agrees you are the best.\u201d Perhaps \u201cDance like nobody\u2019s watching,\u201d and \u201cGenius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration\u201d feel a bit glib for \u201cwisdom.\u201d It\u2019s a bold move to crib from Yoda and write, \u201cDo or do not, there is no try,\u201d but good god It\u2019s an extremely bold move to straight-up rip off Jesus with, \u201cDo onto others as you wish others do onto you\u201d and try to pass it off as an original fortune. \n \n Beyond this, we can perhaps look at the words that appear disproportionately in fortunes compared with the standard English corpus \u2014 lots of action words and positivity, like \u201cgood,\u201d \u201clife,\u201d \u201cgo,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d \u201cmake\u201d and \u201calways\u201d \u2014 but, of course, the real fun comes in when smashing them together and creating brand-new tokens of wisdom with bots like this one. Even though I equipped my bot with hundreds of fortunes to draw on \u2014 it builds a fortune by randomly selecting subsequent words based on how often they succeed the previous pair of words \u2014 it may not be perfect, and all the Markov-bot-generated fortunes may not be winners. Some of the algorithmically generated advice that can now be found at @FortuneBot538 is terrible. \n \n But I\u2019ll never forget when, wrist-deep in a box of shattered shortbreads sometime around fortune number 863, a wise cookie told me, \u201cYou may be disappointed if you fail.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Imagine you're so obsessed with fortune cookies, and the destinies they claim to foretell, that you order more than 1,000 of them to \"unlock their mysteries.\" That's exactly what data journalist Walt Hickey did for FiveThirtyEight.com, picking through the prognostications (676 unique ones among his 1,035-cookie sample), the \"lucky numbers\" included on each slip of paper, and even the Mandarin vocab printed on the reverse sides. Despite his inventory being 15 cookies short of what he ordered (did anyone really think someone in love with data wouldn't count every single cookie?), he made some fascinating and surprising finds. Here, a sample: Those lucky numbers aren't not lucky. Hickey calls this discovery \"weird as hell,\" but he admits that, after comparing the numbers on the fortunes to winning Powerball numbers over a nearly 20-year stretch, the value of playing the fortunes' numbers over that time period would have left a hypothetic gambler with a slight profit (just under $175), while playing random numbers would leave that same gambler with a $2,540 deficit. He's got some common-sense explanations for why that may be. What do the fortunes really tell us? They don't so much tell our fortunes as appeal to our egos and sense of good citizenship, apparently. Only 22.3% of the themes enclosed within the cookies actually dabbled in prophesy: The vast majority (52.9%) included the word \"you\" and spit out praise or criticism of one's strengths and weaknesses, while others included basic life advice and well-worn wisdom like \"Do onto others as you wish others do onto you.\" Hickey even built his own online bot to see what randomly generated fortunes it would churn out.

There could be as many as 1,600 fortunes in the whole corpus, Manjoo estimates, based on the distribution of first letters in sentences in English and Mandarin, as well as how many words start with \"I\" and \"W\" and end with \"Y.\" There's also the question of whether the cookies are actually lucky. \"Don't be ridiculous, of course they're\u2014It's complicated,\" Manjoo writes. \"We can estimate a few things with this information.

The New York Times reports it has analyzed more than 1,000 fortune cookie fortunes\u2014phrases that begin with the letters A, I, W, or Y\u2014and concluded they may actually be luckier than a random set of six numbers. \"Obviously, this is weird as hell. It's mainly thanks to several $1 million prize-winning jackpots with the numbers 19, 30, 55, 18 and 53 with the Powerball number 21,\" writes the Times' Rich Jaroslovsky. He compares the fortunes to the 2,043 Powerball drawings that took place between Nov. 1, 1997, and May 27, 2017, and says he's \"pretty confident we can't claim the numbers are unlucky.\" For example, if a gambler bought one Powerball ticket for every single combination of the supposedly lucky numbers, including repeats, he'd make $4.4 million on $4.2 million in ticket purchases. But if he just bought one ticket for each batch of numbers, using \"unlucky\" randomized digits, and took the expected value of that investment into account, it would be $1.7 million in winnings.

The study's lead author, Matthew Yglesias, says he came up with the idea for the study after eating 1,035 of the cookie-shaped treats, which he calls \"the most delightful topic of all: you.\" He spent a year and a half creating a bot to draw on the words in the cookies\u2014based on how often they were used in previous pairs of words\u2014and found that it \"may not be perfect, and all the Markov-bot-generated fortunes may not be winners,\" he writes at Forbes. \"But I' \u2013 It's called @FortuneBot538, but it's more like a computer program than a human. That's because it was created by 31-year-old Adrien Charpentier, a computer science student at the University of Pennsylvania, who wanted to learn more about the world around him, he explains in a blog post. So he created a bot to do just that, using words he found online and entering them into a database. It then analyzes those words and, using what it calls a \" Markov-bot-generated fortunes\" system, attempts to \"pick subsequent words from the list based on how often they succeed the previous pair of words,\" as the name suggests, to \"build a fortune,\" he writes. So far, he has used the system to predict the winners of 863 tweets, and he's been surprised by the results. \"Some of the algorithmically generated advice that can now be found at @Fortunebot538 is terrible,\" he tweets. \"But I\u2019ll never forget when, wrist-deep in a box of shattered shortbreads sometime around fortune number 863, a wise cookie told me, 'You may be disappointed if you fail. But you are doomed if you don\u2019t try.'\" He's also",

(Associated Press) \n \n MIAMI (AP) \u2014 A quarter-century after he vanished on the eve of a major drug indictment, the last of Miami's fabled \"cocaine cowboys\" was in custody Thursday, nabbed on a suburban bike ride with his wife near Disney World. \n \n Prosecutors say the man living under an assumed name is Gustavo \"Taby\" Falcon, who was part of a homegrown drug gang that used super-fast speedboats to smuggle 75 tons of cocaine in the 1980s \"Miami Vice\" era. \n \n Falcon, 55, had been on the lam since 1991, when his older brother Augusto \"Willie\" Falcon and fellow drug kingpin Salvador \"Sal\" Magluta were indicted by a federal grand jury. U.S. Marshals spokesman Barry Golden said investigators were surprised to find him living in a typical pink stucco home in a quiet, middle-class Kissimmee suburb. \n \n \"Nobody thought Gustavo Falcon was still in the United States,\" Golden said. \n \n At his initial court hearing Thursday in Orlando, Gustavo Falcon agreed to be sent to South Florida to face charges of conspiracy to import cocaine into the U.S. He was ordered held without bond, court records show. \n \n Augusto Falcon and Magluta were small-time drug dealers when they dropped out of high school in the late 1970s to begin building their cocaine empire that would amass more than $2 billion, according to trial evidence. They eventually owned world-class ocean racing boats and lived like royalty. \n \n Mickey Munday, who did prison time for flying cocaine loads for Colombia's Medellin Cartel, said the pair was known for their honesty in business deals \u2014 legal or otherwise \u2014 and the expertise of their boat-building operation. \n \n They also drove flashy cars and lived in seaside mansions, even when murders and shootings linked to their organization brought police scrutiny. \n \n \"They were so flamboyant,\" Munday said. \"Everybody in the world knew what they were doing. Why attract attention to yourself?\" \n \n Gustavo Falcon was not viewed as a top leader of the organization, and vanished just ahead of a 1991 indictment that charged him along with his brother, Magluta and others. He had not been seen since until Wednesday, when U.S. marshals surveilling his rented home in Kissimmee watched him and his wife leave their garage for a bike ride. \n \n A neighbor, David Pera, said he frequently saw the couple riding their bikes and never saw them in a car. An older model pickup truck sitting in the driveway never moved, he said. \n \n \"I'd say hi, they would say hi, and that was about it,\" Pera said Thursday. \n \n It took an exhaustive records search to bring the marshals there. Weeks earlier, they discovered a Florida driver's license issued to a Luis Reiss, traced back to a South Florida home that had been owned by Gustavo Falcon. Then they found 2013 car accident involving Reiss, which eventually led to the house he was sharing with his wife, Amelia. She also had fake identification, in the name of Maria Reiss. \n \n Marshals followed as the couple got on their bikes and headed out Wednesday for what turned into a 40-mile ride. Because they were both wearing helmets and sunglasses, it took a while for investigators to make a positive identification, Golden said. Once they felt sure enough, marshals with guns drawn stopped the couple at an intersection a few blocks from their house. \n \n \"We had to be 100 percent certain this was the guy,\" Golden said. \n \n After his arrest, Gustavo Falcon told authorities he had been living in the Orlando area since 2009 and in the rental house since 2012. It's not clear where he was during all the other years, but officials say it's believed he was living overseas for some of that time. Authorities said they did not know if Falcon had a job. His wife was not arrested. \n \n His brother and Magluta were acquitted of all charges at their trial in 1996, leading to the resignation of then-Miami U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey. Despondent at the loss, Coffey and others went to a strip club where he got into an altercation involving the biting of a stripper. \n \n Later, it turned out that Augusto Falcon and Magluta had bought off witnesses and at least one member of the jury, a foreman who did 17 years in prison after accepting $400,000. Magluta, now 62, was tried a second time, convicted of drug-related money laundering in 2002 and sentenced to 205 years in prison. That was reduced to 195 years in 2006. \n \n Augusto Falcon, now 61, then accepted a plea deal in 2003 on similar charges. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and is scheduled for release from a Kentucky facility on June 17. \n \n Their mansions, boats, cars, planes, bank accounts and other ill-gotten gains are long gone, seized and sold by the government. \n \n Munday, the former cartel pilot, said Augusto Falcon and Magluta should have disappeared as well, after their initial not-guilty verdicts. \n \n \"They were guys who went from nothing to having just about anything they could imagine that they wanted,\" he said. \"As soon as they got the innocent verdict, they should have hauled out of here to Argentina.\" \n \n _____ \n \n Associated Press contributors include John Raoux.

(Associated Press) \n \n The move came as Syrian forces bombarded rebel-held areas in the same province where the Houla killings occurred, although no casualties were immediately reported, activists said. \n \n Survivors blamed pro-regime gunmen for at least some of the carnage in Houla as the killings reverberated inside Syria and beyond, further isolating President Bashar Assad and embarrassing his few remaining allies. The Syrian government denied its troops were behind the killings and blamed \"armed terrorists.\" \n \n The U.N.'s top human rights body planned to hold a special session Friday to address the massacre. \n \n Damascus had said it would conclude its own investigation into the Houla deaths by Wednesday but it was not clear if the findings would be made public. \n \n The Houla killings prompted Western nations to expel Syrian diplomats in a coordinated protest, with the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria ordering top Syrian diplomats to leave on Tuesday. \n \n Syria's state-run media on Wednesday denounced the diplomatic expulsions, which began Tuesday with announcements by the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria, as \"unprecedented hysteria.\" \n \n Turkey, Syria's neighbor and a former close ally, joined the coordinated protest on Wednesday. Turkey has been among the most outspoken critics of the Assad regime. It closed its embassy in Damascus in March and withdrew the ambassador.

The consulate in Istanbul will remain open for consular duties only. \n \n \"It is out of the question to remain silent and without any reaction in the face of this action, which amounts to a crime against humanity,\" the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"This grave crime against humanity by those who have attempted a massacre of civilians cannot go unpunished.\" \n \n Japan also ordered the Syrian ambassador in Tokyo to leave the country because of concerns about violence against civilians.

Security Council does not take swift action to pressure Syria to end its 14-month assault on the opposition, member nations may have no choice but to consider acting outside the United Nations, the U.S. envoy to the world body said on Wednesday. \n \n Speaking to reporters after international mediator Kofi Annan's deputy, Jean-Marie Guehenno, gave the 15-nation council a bleak assessment of the impact of Annan's efforts to halt the violence in Syria, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said there were three ways the Syrian conflict could end. \n \n The first would be if Syrian President Bashar-al Assad's government decided to comply with its obligations under Annan's six-point peace plan - stopping its military assaults on Syrian towns, withdrawing heavy weapons, returning troops to barracks and talking with the opposition on a \"political transition.\" \n \n The second option would involve the council taking action to pressure Damascus to fully comply with the Annan plan, she said. \n \n Neither of those scenarios appear likely because Damascus has shown no interest in living up to its commitments and Russia has made clear that any Security Council moves to step up the pressure on Assad's government through sanctions are out of the question. \n \n \"In the absence of either of those two scenarios there seems to be only one other alternative, and that is indeed the worst case,\" Rice said, adding that it was unfortunately looking like \"the most probable.\" \n \n \"That is that the violence escalates, the conflict spreads and intensifies,\" she said. \"It involves countries in the region, it takes on increasingly sectarian forms, and we have a major crisis not only in Syria but in the region.\" \n \n In such a case, Rice said, the Annan plan would be dead and the Syrian violence would become \"a proxy conflict with arms flowing in from all sides.\" \n \n \"And members of this council and members of the international community are left with the option only of having to consider whether they're prepared to take actions outside of the Annan plan and the authority of this council,\" she said. \n \n She did not specify what kind of \"actions\" she meant. The United States has led past military interventions that were not authorized by the Security Council, namely in Kosovo and Iraq. So far the United States and its Western allies have rejected military options and said they would not arm the rebels. \n \n RUSSIA DEFENDS ARMS SALES TO SYRIA \n \n German Ambassador Peter Wittig said council members expressed revulsion at the massacre at Houla last week, where more than 100 people, including many children were killed, probably by Syrian government forces and militia. \n \n Wittig urged the council to consider a resolution that would sanction \"spoilers\" of the Annan plan and suggested that it think about whether the mission of unarmed observers should be expanded. \n \n The British and French envoys also spoke of the need to intensify pressure on Assad's government. \n \n But Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Moscow, which holds a veto on the Security Council, opposes the idea of ratcheting up pressure on Damascus in the form of U.N. sanctions. \n \n \"Our attitude toward sanctions, frankly, continues to be negative,\" he said, adding that Moscow wants countries doing so to stop supplying weapons to Syrian rebels. He also voiced concern about the increasing presence of extremists in Syria. \n \n Asked about Russia's supply of weapons to Assad's government, Churkin said: \"The weapons we may have provided to Syria under various contracts, which were concluded a long time ago, are fully in line with international law and do not contribute to the current armed violence in Syria.\" \n \n The expulsion of Syrian diplomats from several countries, including the United States, could be mistaken as a precursor to foreign military intervention in Syria, Churkin said. \n \n \"I hope an effort is made not to allow this step to be misinterpreted as something which is basically a prerequisite of some kind of a foreign military intervention in the near future, which is not the case.\" \n \n Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari complained about unilateral U.S., European and other sanctions, calling them \"irresponsible acts.\" \n \n Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Guehenno said that \"in the council there is an understanding that any sliding toward a full-scale civil war in Syria would be catastrophic and the Security Council now needs to have that kind of strategic discussion on how that needs to be avoided.\" \n \n He did not say what kinds of steps the council should take. Earlier he told the council via video link that the violence is unlikely to stop without political negotiations between the government and opposition, U.N. diplomats said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Anthony Boadle and Christopher Wilson)",

    "document": "Google \u2019s ambition to create the world\u2019s largest digital library and bookstore has run into the reality of a 300-year-old legal concept: copyright. \n \n The company\u2019s plan to digitize every book ever published and make them widely available was derailed on Tuesday when a federal judge in New York rejected a sweeping $125 million legal settlement the company had worked out with groups representing authors and publishers. \n \n The decision throws into legal limbo one of the most ambitious undertakings in Google\u2019s history, and it brings into sharp focus concerns about the company\u2019s growing power over information. While the profit potential of the book project is not clear, the effort is one of the pet projects of Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is set to become its chief executive next month. And the project has wide support inside the company, whose corporate mission is to organize all of the world\u2019s information. \n \n \u201cIt was very much consistent with Larry\u2019s idealism that all of the world\u2019s information should be made available freely,\u201d said Ken Auletta, the author of \u201cGoogled: The End of the World as We Know It.\u201d \n \n But citing copyright, antitrust and other concerns, Judge Denny Chin said that the settlement went too far. He said it would have granted Google a \u201cde facto monopoly\u201d and the right to profit from books without the permission of copyright owners. \n \n Judge Chin acknowledged that \u201cthe creation of a universal digital library would benefit many,\u201d but said that the proposed agreement was \u201cnot fair, adequate and reasonable.\u201d He left open the possibility that a substantially revised agreement could pass legal muster. Judge Chin was recently elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but handled the case as a district court judge. \n \n The decision is also a setback for the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers, which sued Google in 2005 over its book-scanning project. After two years of painstaking negotiations, the authors, publishers and Google signed a sweeping settlement that would have brought millions of printed works into the digital age. \n \n The deal turned Google, the authors and the publishers into allies instead of opponents. Together, they mounted a defense of the agreement against an increasingly vocal chorus of opponents that included Google rivals like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as academics, some authors, copyright experts, the Justice Department and foreign governments. \n \n Now the author and publisher groups have to decide whether to resume their copyright case against Google, drop it or try to negotiate a new settlement. \n \n Paul Aiken, executive director of the Authors Guild, said in an interview that it was too early to tell what the next step would be. \u201cThe judge did expressly leave the door open for a revised settlement,\u201d he said. \n \n Hilary Ware, managing counsel at Google, said in a statement that the decision was \u201cclearly disappointing,\u201d adding: \u201cLike many others, we believe this agreement has the potential to open up access to millions of books that are currently hard to find in the U.S. today.\u201d The company would not comment further. \n \n Google has already scanned some 15 million books. The entire text of books whose copyrights have expired are available through Google\u2019s Book Search service. It shows up to 20 percent of copyrighted titles that it has licensed from publishers, and only snippets of copyrighted titles for which it has no license. \n \n The settlement would have allowed it to go much further, making millions of out-of-print books broadly available online and selling access to them. It would have given authors and publishers new ways to earn money from digital copies of their works. \n \n Yet the deal faced strong opposition. Among the most persistent objections, raised by the Justice Department and others, were concerns that it would have given Google exclusive rights to profit from millions of so-called orphan works, books whose rights holders are unknown or cannot be found. They also said no other company would be able to build a comparable library, leaving Google free to charge high prices for its collection. And some critics said the exclusive access to millions of books would help cement Google\u2019s grip on the Internet search market. \n \n Judge Chin largely agreed with the critics on those points. But he suggested that substantial objections would be eliminated if the settlement applied only to books whose authors or copyright owners would explicitly \u201copt in\u201d to its terms. \n \n When the Justice Department suggested as much last year during a court hearing, Google rejected the idea as unworkable. It would leave millions of orphan works out of the agreement and out of Google\u2019s digital library, greatly diminishing its value to Google and to the public. \n \n \u201cOpt-in doesn\u2019t look all that different from ordinary licensing deals that publishers do all the time,\u201d said James Grimmelmann, a professor at New York Law School who has studied the legal aspects of the agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s why this has been such a big deal \u2014 the settlement could have meant orphan books being made available again. This is basically going back to status quo, and orphan books won\u2019t be available.\u201d \n \n Some longtime opponents of the settlement hailed the decision, saying that they hoped it would prompt Congress to tackle legislation that would make orphan works accessible. \n \n \u201cEven though it is efficient for Google to make all the books available, the orphan works and unclaimed books problem should be addressed by Congress, not by the private settlement of a lawsuit,\u201d said Pamela Samuelson, a copyright expert at the University of California, Berkeley who helped organize efforts to block the agreement. \n \n Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the court had reached the \u201cright result.\u201d \n \n A group of publishers said they were disappointed by the decision, but believed that it provided \u201cclear guidance\u201d on the changes necessary for the settlement to be approved. \n \n John Sargent, the chief executive of Macmillan, spoke on behalf of the publishers, which included Penguin Group USA, McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, Simon & Schuster and John Wiley & Sons. \n \n \u201cThe publisher plaintiffs are prepared to enter into a narrower settlement along those lines to take advantage of its groundbreaking opportunities,\u201d Mr. Sargent said in a statement. \u201cWe hope the other parties will do so as well.\u201d \n \n He added: \u201cThe publisher plaintiffs are prepared to modify the settlement agreement to gain approval. We plan to work together with Google, the Authors Guild and others to overcome the objections raised by the court and promote the fundamental principle behind our lawsuit, that copyrighted content cannot be used without the permission of the owner, or outside the law.\u201d ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed settlement between Google Inc. and book authors and publishers as unfair and inadequate, dealing a new setback to the Internet giant\u2019s ongoing effort to push its digital-books business forward on a more solid legal footing. \n \n Judge Denny Chin wrote in an opinion filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that the agreement \u201cwould simply go too far\u201d in terms of allowing Google GOOG, +0.73% to establish a business arrangement that grants it the right to \u201cexploit entire books, without permission of the copyright owners.\u201d \n \n Google began a controversial effort to scan vast quantities of books in 2004, the year that the company went public. Google has argued that its efforts can expand access to otherwise difficult-to-access volumes. \n \n Plaintiffs including the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers sued Google in 2005, complaining that the company\u2019s digital scanning violated copyright protections. \n \n According to its proposed settlement agreement, Google would gain the right to provide copyrighted works on its books service, apart from those actively withheld by copyright owners. \n \n In his ruling on Tuesday, Chin wrote that his concerns about the agreement could be eased by converting it to an \u201copt-in\u201d arrangement for copyright owners, rather than \u201copt-out.\u201d He urged the parties to consider revising the agreement. \n \n Hilary Ware, Google\u2019s managing counsel, said in a written statement, \u201cThis is clearly disappointing, but we\u2019ll review the court\u2019s decision and consider our options.\u201d \n \n \u201cLike many others, we believe this agreement has the potential to open up access to millions of books that are currently hard to find in the U.S. today,\u201d Ware said. \u201cRegardless of the outcome, we\u2019ll continue to work to make more of the world\u2019s books discoverable online through Google Books and Google eBooks.\u201d \n \n Google\u2019s eBooks service is designed to enable users to shop for and buy digital books from Google and other retailers, and to get access to them on multiple devices. \n \n \u2018Everything we were asking for\u2019 \n \n The Open Book Alliance, which includes Google rivals Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.03% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.40% has argued that the proposed settlement raises too many concerns, and had urged Chin to reject it. \n \n Gary Reback, who is counsel to the Open Book Alliance, said Tuesday that Chin\u2019s opinion includes \u201ceverything we were asking for.\u201d \n \n In particular, Reback praised Chin\u2019s tying of Google\u2019s books services to its market-dominating search engine. The proposed settlement agreement \u201cwould arguably give Google control over the search market,\u201d Chin wrote, due to provisions such as the inability of search rivals to provide for the online perusal of many of the scanned books. \n \n Reback said that the issues involving antitrust, privacy and approach to copyright ownership cited by Chin in his opinion are the \u201cthree big issues Google is facing everywhere now.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis mirrors the bigger Google question,\u201d he added. \n \n As Google has grown in size and financial might, it has faced increasing scrutiny from regulators and rivals related to its acquisitions, collection of private data and use of copyrighted material. \n \n Google had revised its settlement agreement with authors and publishers, reached in 2008, the following year. However, the Justice Department criticized the planned arrangement, saying in a filing that it could lend Google \u201csignificant and possibly anticompetitive advantages.\u201d \n \n DOJ spokeswoman Gina Talamona said in a statement issued Tuesday that, \u201cWe believe the Court reached the right result on this complex, proposed settlement. The department expressed to the court that, as structured, the settlement proposed by Google and the authors and publishers exceeded the scope of the underlying lawsuit on which it was based and created concerns regarding antitrust, class certification and copyright issues. We are pleased that the court supported our position. \u201c \n \n A conference between Google and authors and publishers has been scheduled for next month. \n \n In a statement issued Tuesday, publishers involved in the litigation, including McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. MHP, +0.00% and the Association of American Publishers, said they are \u201cprepared to modify the settlement agreement to gain approval.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe plan to work together with Google, the Authors Guild and others to overcome the objections raised by the and promote the fundamental principle behind our lawsuit, that copyrighted content cannot be used without the permission of the owner, or outside the law,\u201d the publishers said.",

    "document": "Years from now\u2014maybe in a decade, maybe sooner\u2014if all goes according to plan, the most complex machine ever built will be switched on in an Alpine forest in the South of France. The machine, called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, will stand a hundred feet tall, and it will weigh twenty-three thousand tons\u2014more than twice the weight of the Eiffel Tower. At its core, densely packed high-precision equipment will encase a cavernous vacuum chamber, in which a super-hot cloud of heavy hydrogen will rotate faster than the speed of sound, twisting like a strand of DNA as it circulates. The cloud will be scorched by electric current (a surge so forceful that it will make lightning seem like a tiny arc of static electricity), and bombarded by concentrated waves of radiation. Beams of uncharged particles\u2014the energy in them so great it could vaporize a car in seconds\u2014will pour into the chamber, adding tremendous heat. In this way, the circulating hydrogen will become ionized, and achieve temperatures exceeding two hundred million degrees Celsius\u2014more than ten times as hot as the sun at its blazing core. \n \n No natural phenomenon on Earth will be hotter. Like the sun, the cloud will go nuclear. The zooming hydrogen atoms, in a state of extreme kinetic excitement, will slam into one another, fusing to form a new element\u2014helium\u2014and with each atomic coupling explosive energy will be released: intense heat, gamma rays, X rays, a torrential flux of fast-moving neutrons propelled in every direction. There isn\u2019t a physical substance that could contain such a thing. Metals, plastics, ceramics, concrete, even pure diamond\u2014all would be obliterated on contact, and so the machine will hold the superheated cloud in a \u201cmagnetic bottle,\u201d using the largest system of superconducting magnets in the world. Just feet from the reactor\u2019s core, the magnets will be cooled to two hundred and sixty-nine degrees below zero, nearly the temperature of deep space. Caught in the grip of their titanic forces, the artificial earthbound sun will be suspended, under tremendous pressure, in the pristine nothingness of ITER\u2019s vacuum interior. \n \n For the machine\u2019s creators, this process\u2014sparking and controlling a self-sustaining synthetic star\u2014will be the culmination of decades of preparation, billions of dollars\u2019 worth of investment, and immeasurable ingenuity, misdirection, recalibration, infighting, heartache, and ridicule. Few engineering feats can compare, in scale, in technical complexity, in ambition or hubris. Even the ITER organization, a makeshift scientific United Nations, assembled eight years ago to construct the machine, is unprecedented. Thirty-five countries, representing more than half the world\u2019s population, are invested in the project, which is so complex to finance that it requires its own currency: the ITER Unit of Account. \n \n No one knows ITER\u2019s true cost, which may be incalculable, but estimates have been rising steadily, and a conservative figure rests at twenty billion dollars\u2014a sum that makes ITER the most expensive scientific instrument on Earth. But if it is truly possible to bottle up a star, and to do so economically, the technology could solve the world\u2019s energy problems for the next thirty million years, and help save the planet from environmental catastrophe. Hydrogen, a primordial element, is the most abundant atom in the universe, a potential fuel that poses little risk of scarcity. Eventually, physicists hope, commercial reactors modelled on ITER will be built, too\u2014generating terawatts of power with no carbon, virtually no pollution, and scant radioactive waste. The reactor would run on no more than seawater and lithium. It would never melt down. It would realize a yearning, as old as the story of Prometheus, to bring the light of the heavens to Earth, and bend it to humanity\u2019s will. ITER, in Latin, means \u201cthe way.\u201d \n \n The main road to the ITER construction site from Aix-en-Provence, where I had booked a room, is the A51 highway. The drive is about half an hour, winding north past farmland and the sun-glittered Durance River. Just about every form of energy is in evidence nearby, from hydroelectric dams to floating solar panels. Seams of lignite, a soft brownish coal, run beneath the soil in Provence, but the deposits have become too expensive to mine. Several miles from Aix, a large coal plant, with a chimney that climbs hundreds of feet into the sky, is being converted to burn biomass\u2014leaves, branches, and agricultural debris. ITER is being built a mile or two from the wooded campus of the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9nergie Atomique et aux \u00c9nergies Alternatives, a state-funded research organization, created in 1945 to advance nuclear power, and now also renewable energy. Evergreen oak and Aleppo pine cover the foothills; beneath them, the French government maintains its largest strategic oil reserve. \n \n ITER\u2019s headquarters, a five-floor edifice, was erected two years ago. An undulating wave of gray concrete slats shade its floor-to-ceiling windows. Its interior is simple: whitewashed walls, polished-concrete floors. The building\u2019s southern fa\u00e7ade overlooks a work site, more than a hundred acres of construction on the opposite side of a berm. By the time the reactor is turned on\u2014the formal target date for its first experiment is 2020\u2014the site will be home to a small city. Nearly forty buildings will surround the machine, from cooling towers to a cryogenics plant, which will produce liquid helium to cool the superconducting magnets. A skywalk extends from the second floor of the headquarters to the berm, where a capacious NASA-style control room will one day be built. For now, the bridge ends in a pile of ochre dirt, and the only way to the vast expanse of construction is via a circuitous drive. ||||| ITER, the international fusion reactor project in France, is reeling from an assessment that found serious problems with the project's leadership, management, and governance.

Scientists have long dreamed of such a reactor to harness power by nuclear fusion, a cleaner process than fission that produces almost no radioactive waste. First proposed in 1985, ITER relies on an oft-squabbling, international cadre of experts who vie for the spotlight and struggle to convince politicians that it's still viable. The US has yanked and recommitted funding over the years, and a family-owned company in San Diego is building the all-important solenoid\u2014in this case, a 20-mile-long cable wrapped around a metal column\u2014to harness the plant's plasma in a \"magnetic bottle\" (because no physical material can contain it).

And unfortunately it has backfired on us \u2014 and this is where we are today.\u201d Lansbury did add, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s awful to say we can\u2019t make ourselves look as attractive as possible without being knocked down and raped.\u201d \n \n She concluded her newly released statement by criticizing the reaction to her remarks in the Times, declaring, \u201cLastly, I would like to add that I am troubled by how quickly and brutishly some have taken my comments out of context and attempted to blame my generation, my age, or my mindset, without having read the entirety of what I said.\u201d ||||| Actress Angela Lansbury has gotten a taste of online culture in 2017, and she doesn\u2019t seem to have liked it very much. The Beauty And The Beast and Murder, She Wrote star came under fire this week, after people took umbrage at comments she made that stated that women are in some part complicit for making themselves attractive to men who sexually harass or assault them. \n \n Lansbury\u2019s remarks\u2014which included statements like, \u201cWe have to own up to the fact that women, since time immemorial, have gone out of their way to make themselves attractive,\u201d and \u201cWe must sometimes take blame, women. I really do think that\u201d\u2014were part of a wider conversation in which she also stated that there was no excuse for a man to harm a woman. Caveats aside, though, her comments were still met with a great deal of anger online, including from groups like Rape Crisis England & Wales, which noted that victim-blaming attitudes are only ever harmful to people who have been subject to sexual assault. \n \n Now, Lansbury has responded to the criticism levied against her, clarifying her points, citing her bona fides as a feminist, and expressing no small amount of anger at the feeling that she\u2019s been misinterpreted or taken out of context. Her statement: \n \n There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner. And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise. Those who have known the quality of my work and the many public statements I have made over the course of my life, must know, that I am a strong supporter of Women\u2019s Rights. Lastly, I would like to add that I am troubled by how quickly and brutishly some have taken my comments out of context and attempted to blame my generation, my age, or my mindset, without having read the entirety of what I said. \n \n Which, uh\u2026Welcome to the internet, Dame Angela. ||||| Angela Lansbury has clarified remarks she made about sexual harassment after she was widely criticized for saying women must sometimes \"take blame.\" \n \n \"There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner,\" the 92-year-old \"Murder, She Wrote\" star said in a statement to People. \"And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise.

And unfortunately, it has backfired on us -- and this is where we are today,\" Lansbury said. \n \n She went on to say, \"We must sometimes take blame, women. I really do think that. Although it's awful to say we can't make ourselves look as attractive as possible without being knocked down and raped.\" \n \n Lansbury also added that there was \"no excuse\" for women being harassed. \n \n \"Should women be prepared for this? No, they shouldn't have to be,\" she said. \"There's no excuse for that. And I think it will stop now -- it will have to. I think a lot of men must be very worried at this point.\" \n \n After Lansbury's initial remarks, Rape Crisis England & Wales released a statement saying, \"It is a deeply unhelpful myth that rape and other forms of sexual violence are caused or \u2018provoked\u2019 by women\u2019s sexuality or \u2018attractiveness.'\" \n \n Patricia Arquette took Lansbury to task on Twitter. \"It doesn't matter how young or old, how beautiful or homely.

End of story. \u2014 Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) November 28, 2017 \n \n Designer Donna Karan made similar remarks to Lansbury's in the immediate aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct scandal when she suggested that women were \"asking for it\" by how they dressed.

    "document": "Appalachian Trail hiker Geraldine Largay survived for nearly a month after getting lost along the trail in Franklin County in July 2013, and documented her final days in a journal that was among the personal effects found by the Maine Warden Service when it recovered her remains more than two years later. \n \n The journal entries, as well as text messages she tried to send her husband on a cellphone that also was recovered, were among documents released Wednesday by the warden service that paint a picture of a slight misadventure that turned tragic when a massive search-and-rescue effort scoured the vast area in vain. \n \n Excerpts from warden service report \n \n \u201cWhen you find my body, please call my husband George and my daughter Kerry,\u201d Largay wrote in a journal entry dated Aug. 6. \u201cIt will be the greatest kindness for them to know that I am dead and where you found me \u2013 no matter how many years from now. Please find it in your heart to mail the contents of this bag to one of them.\u201d \n \n Problems began for Largay, a 66-year-old hiker from Brentwood, Tennessee, when she got lost after leaving the trail for a bathroom break while heading north en route to the Spaulding lean-to on July 22, 2013. At 11 a.m., she used her blue Samsung phone to text her husband: \u201cIn somm trouble. Got off trail to go to br. Now lost. Can u call AMC to c if a trail maintainer can help me. Somewhere north of woods road. Xox.\u201d \n \n But the message wouldn\u2019t transmit because there was no cell coverage in the area. She tried sending the text 10 more times over the next hour and a half. \n \n The next day, walking west through the dense and vast woods of northern Franklin County, seeking a higher elevation in the hopes of getting a cellphone signal, she tried texting her husband again at 4:18 p.m.: \u201cLost since yesterday. Off trail 3 or 4 miles. Call police for what to do pls. Xox.\u201d \n \n She tried sending it again 20 minutes later. Still nothing. \n \n At that point, Largay decided her best chance of survival would be staying put. She set up a tent on a bed of pine needles and sticks, and wrote in a journal every day for at least the next 18 days. A final entry was dated Aug. 18 \u2013 26 days after she set up camp. \n \n The warden service found Largay\u2019s remains and her campsite more than two years later, detailing the search-and-recovery effort in a report on Nov. 12, 2015, that was part of a 1,579-page case file obtained Wednesday by the Morning Sentinel. The warden service\u2019s case file, which was first reported by the Boston Globe, contains hundreds of pages of evidence photographs, witness interviews and tips. \n \n Largay kept the journal and her cellphone in a bag that was recovered by the warden service after a forester came across her tent and skeletal remains and led wardens to the site on Oct. 15, 2015. The warden service had not previously disclosed that a journal had been found there. \n \n Warden service spokesman Cpl. John MacDonald declined to comment Wednesday when asked about the report and its contents. \n \n David Fox, a friend of the Largay family who has previously acted as a spokesman, did not return a call seeking comment Wednesday. \n \n A SINGLE CLUE TO GO ON \n \n Largay, a through-hiker nicknamed \u201cInchworm,\u201d started on the 2,184-mile Appalachian Trail in West Virginia in April with a friend, Jane Lee. \n \n Largay\u2019s husband of 42 years, George Largay, told police that the trail, which starts at Springer Mountain in Georgia and ends at Mount Katahdin in Maine, was on his wife\u2019s \u201cbucket list\u201d and that he had supported the women along the way, meeting them at different locations and taking them to motels to sleep, do their laundry and shower. \n \n Lee had to leave the trail because of a family emergency, and Largay decided to continue on alone. Her husband reported her missing on July 24, 2013, after she failed to show up at a prearranged meeting point on state Route 27 in Wyman Township. That was two days after she was last seen by other hikers early on July 22, at the Poplar Ridge lean-to. \n \n Largay died in her sleeping bag inside a zipped tent, according to a report from the chief medical examiner released in January. She died from a lack of food and water and environmental exposure, the report said. \n \n She was about 2 miles from the Appalachian Trail, on land belonging to the U.S. Navy. The warden service, volunteer groups, police and others looked for Largay over 26 months, and the search is considered one of the most lengthy and expensive in state history. \n \n \u201cInvestigation would take time to work through several false leads, false identifications, and locating and finding hikers who had valuable information and continued to hike the trail,\u201d Lt. Kevin Adam of the warden service wrote in his report filed Nov. 12, 2015. \n \n After seven days of intense searching, the effort was suspended on July 30, 2013, though periodic efforts would continue over the coming months. \n \n A photo of Largay taken at the Poplar Ridge lean-to by another hiker was the single clue that investigators had to go on. \n \n \u201cThere were many leads over the next 26 months, ranging from persons of interest for possible criminal activity related to Gerry\u2019s disappearance, identity theft involving Gerry\u2019s personal information, geographic information by psychics, sightings in different states, to information suggesting Bigfoot was responsible for her disappearance,\u201d Adam wrote in his report. \u201cAll of these leads were investigated with our investigative partners.\u201d \n \n The forester, who was working on a contract for the U.S. Navy, came across Largay\u2019s tent and remains on Oct. 11, 2015. \n \n POOR SENSE OF DIRECTION \n \n Though Largay\u2019s family and friends described her as an experienced hiker, the wardens\u2019 case file indicated she had a poor sense of direction, and when she made a mistake would become easily flustered. \n \n Lee, who described herself as Largay\u2019s best friend, told the wardens about multiple occasions when she had to backtrack on the trail to find her hiking companion. In those cases, Largay had either become lost or had fallen behind, Lee told investigators. Lee also said her friend was scared of the dark and of being alone, and never wanted to bring extra supplies because she had a sore back and wanted to avoid carrying a heavy pack. \n \n Lee, who didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday, told the wardens that she was certain Largay\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t aware of her struggles, and he too told them that \u201cGerry was probably in over her head.\u201d \n \n On Oct. 18, 2015, Adam and other game wardens met with Largay\u2019s husband and other family members to show them where Largay was found, arriving at the site after hiking through thick softwood trees along the Appalachian Trail, into more open terrain with hardwoods, past old logging roads, down and up steep ridges and over brooks. \n \n \u201cAfter everyone finished looking around the campsite, the family left a cross where the tent was located along with several family mementos,\u201d Adam wrote. \u201cAfter clearing the campsite, we headed south.\u201d \n \n Share \n \n Want the news vital to Maine?

Sign up for more newsletters here \n \n It appears that Largay, who was 66 and lived in Tennessee, survived for nearly four weeks after she was reported missing and three weeks after authorities had given up the search, which was one of the largest in Maine Warden Service history. \n \n Rescuers at several times came within 100 yards of her, authorities said. But her body was not found until October 2015. \n \n In the wardens\u2019 file, which totals 1,579 pages, authorities said they believed that Largay went off the trail to use the bathroom and couldn\u2019t find her way back. The site is densely wooded and in an area so remote it\u2019s used by the Navy for survival and evasion training. \n \n The file also says wardens found evidence that Largay attempted to text her husband after becoming lost, but the crucial texts were not delivered because of poor cell reception. \n \n Advertisement \n \n In a text sent at 11:01 a.m. on July 22, 2013, Largay said, \u201cIn somm trouble. Got off trail to go to br. Now lost. Can u call AMC to c if a trail maintainer can help me. Somewhere north of woods road. XOX.\u201d \n \n At 4:18 p.m. on July 23, 2013, after spending her first night lost in the forest, she texted George, \u201cLost since yesterday. Off trail 3 or 4 miles. Call police for what to do pls. XOX.\u201d \n \n She attempted additional texts. According to the wardens, the last activity on her phone was dated Aug. 6, 2013, the day she wrote the note to her family. \n \n The last entry in her journal is dated Aug. 18, meaning she apparently survived at least 26 days after she disappeared. \n \n The wardens concluded that Largay made her way to higher ground in an attempt to get better cell coverage. She established a campground on a knoll. \n \n Advertisement \n \n She set up her tent and made use of both her rain gear and an emergency Mylar blanket. \n \n She appeared to have crafted a flag out of a branch and shirt and attempted to start a large fire, according to the newly released file, presumably to reveal her location. \n \n Largay built a latrine area away from her tent and kept wrappers from her dwindling food supply \u2014 Clif bars, tuna fish packs, and Gatorade powder \u2014 tucked in a large Ziploc bag. \n \n Wardens found a rosary among her possessions. She was just a 10-minute walk from a dirt trail that turns into a road. She died from a lack of food and environmental exposure.\u200b \n \n Largay\u2019s family requested privacy Wednesday while they took the time to read the file in depth. \n \n John MacDonald, spokesman for the warden service, said Wednesday that the agency is drafting a statement regarding the release of the file that will be issued at a later date. \n \n He also said no internal review of the warden\u2019s search has been conducted or is planned at this time. \n \n Deb Palman, who established the wardens\u2019 K-9 search unit and currently heads up Maine\u2019s only independent K-9 search firm, says conditions in the area made a successful search all but impossible. \n \n \u201cThis is some of the worst country in Maine,\u201d Palman said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how logistically difficult this area was. On any given day, by the time a searcher would get close to where Largay was found, they\u2019d have to turn around to make it back to their vehicles by nightfall.\u201d \n \n The release of the file is the latest chapter in the disappearance that has transfixed the region and the large community of hikers who traverse the Appalachian Trail. \n \n Largay, an experienced hiker whose trail moniker was \u201cInchworm,\u201d had started hiking the trail in April 2013 with her hiking partner, Jane Lee. \n \n Their plan was to hike from Harpers Ferry, W. Va., to Maine\u2019s Mount Katahdin, the northern terminus of the trail. \n \n A family emergency forced Lee to leave the trail as the duo crossed into New Hampshire. Largay continued to hike solo. An old back injury prevented her from carrying a full backpack, so her husband would meet her along the way with fresh supplies. \n \n George Largay last saw his wife on the morning of Sunday, July 21. \n \n On that day, Geraldine Largay set out on what was to be a three-day hike beginning near Maine\u2019s Saddleback Mountain and terminating just north of the Sugarloaf Ski Resort. \n \n She was due to meet her husband at a parking lot off Route 27 there. \n \n He arrived at the appointed time but was not able to locate Largay. Thinking that a severe rainstorm the day before might have waylaid her, he spent that night in their vehicle, hoping she would arrive. \n \n The next morning, he hailed a State Police officer driving by and reported her missing. \n \n According to the file, Largay established a campsite atop a knoll located on property owned by the Navy as part of their Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape school located there. She would stay there for the remaining days of her life. \n \n The site, located near a stream, was thoughtful and orderly. \n \n Largay built a platform of logs and pine boughs on which to pitch her tent. \n \n While at the site, she also used a small black composition book as a daily journal. The cover of the journal includes what might have been Largay\u2019s last written words: \u201cGeorge please read. Xoxo.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A lost hiker in Maine starved to death after waiting for rescue and then accepting her fate, heartbreaking journal entries have revealed. Geraldine Largay, a 66-year-old from Tennessee, disappeared while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maine on July 22, 2013, and the newly disclosed journal shows that she survived for at least 26 days, the Portland Press Herald reports. \"When you find my body, please call my husband George and my daughter Kerry,\" she wrote in an Aug. 6 journal entry. \"It will be the greatest kindness for them to know that I am dead and where you found me\u2014no matter how many years from now.\" The final entry was dated Aug. 18. Her skeletal remains were discovered in a tent 3,000 feet from the trail more than two years later. Largay, who was trying to complete a \"bucket list\" hike from West Virginia to the trail's end solo after a friend left for a family emergency, was reported missing by her husband after she failed to make it to a rendezvous point. A huge search and rescue effort followed, but it was suspended after a week. According to a 1,579-page Maine Warden Service report, Largay became lost after leaving the trail to go to the bathroom, the Boston Globe reports. She tried to text her husband at least a dozen times, but she was unable to get a signal even after moving to higher ground. She then set up a campsite on a knoll, where authorities found a handmade flag and evidence she had tried to start a signal fire. On Oct. 18, 2015, a week after a forester found her body, her husband of 42 years and other family members joined wardens in a hike to the site, where they left a cross and family mementos.

Her journal was among the personal effects found with her remains. \"When you find my body, please call my husband George and my daughter Kerry,\" Largay wrote in a journal entry dated Aug. 6. \"It will be the greatest kindness for them to know that I am dead and where you found me\u2014no matter how many years from now. Please find it in your heart to mail the contents of this bag to one of them.\" Largay, a 66-year-old hiker from Tennessee, was returning from a bathroom break on the trail in Franklin County when she became lost. She tried to send her husband text messages 10 times over an hour and a half, but the messages wouldn't transmit because there was no cell coverage in \u2013 A journal kept by a woman who died while hiking the Appalachian Trail was found in a bag that led to her remains more than two years after she set up camp in the woods, according to a newly released Maine Warden Service report. The 1,579-page report, which the Boston Globe reports was obtained by the Morning Sentinel, details howInchworm's husband, George Largay, reported his wife missing on July 24, 2013, after she failed to show up at a prearranged meeting point on a state Route 27 in Wyman Township. Over the next 26 months, volunteer groups, police, and others searched for the 62-year-old through-hiker, who was about 2 miles from the trail on land belonging to the US Navy. She was found dead in her sleeping bag inside a zipped tent at the Poplar Ridge lean-to on Aug. 18, 2013. A medical examiner's report released in January said she died from a lack of food and water and environmental exposure. Largay's journal was found at the site where her tent was found, and she wrote in it every day for at least 18 days before setting up camp, the Globe reports. According to the report, she tried to text her husband 10 times in an attempt to get a cellphone signal \u2013 For 26 months, Maine authorities searched for Gerry Largay, who disappeared while hiking the Appalachian Trail with her husband in July 2013. Her body was found in her tent in October 2015 by a forester who'd been working on a Navy contract, the Portland Press Herald reports. According to a Maine Warden Service report seen by the Bangor Daily News, the investigation into Largay's disappearance focused on \"persons of interest,\" as well as \"identity theft involving Gerry's personal information, geographic information by psychics, sightings in different states, to information suggesting Bigfoot was responsible for her disappearance.\" The report states that a single photo of Largay taken at the Poplar Ridge Trail was the only clue that investigators had to go on. The search for Largay was considered one of the most lengthy and expensive in the state's history. The investigation was suspended in July 2013 after seven days of \"intense searching.\" The case file states that Largay had a poor sense of direction, was scared of the dark, and didn't want to carry extra supplies because she had a sore back and wanted to avoid carrying a heavy pack. Her best friend told investigators that she had to backtrack on the trail to find Largay when she became lost or had fallen behind. \u2013 \"When you find my body, please call my husband George and my daughter Kerry. It will be the greatest kindness for them to know that I am dead and where you found me\u2014no matter how many years from now.\" That's what 66-year-old Geraldine Largay wrote to her family nearly two weeks after she disappeared while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maine in 2013, the Boston Globe reports. Her body wasn't found until October 2015. According to the official file on her disappearance released Wednesday by the Maine Warden Service, Largay spent her first night lost in the woods and tried to text her husband after becoming lost, but the texts were not delivered because of poor cell reception. Her husband reported her missing on July 22, 2013, after she failed to return home from the bathroom. The file also reveals that Largay's journal was found near her body. In it, she wrote that when she was found, \"Please find it in your heart to mail the contents of this bag to one of them.\" The bag included her cellphone and a journal. Largay apparently survived for nearly four weeks after being reported missing and three weeks after authorities gave up the search, which was one of the largest in the service's history, the Bangor Daily News reports. \u2013 Hiker Geraldine Largay set out on what was to be a three-day hike on Maine's Mount Katahdin in July 2013 with only a small backpack because her partner had to leave the trail due to a family emergency. But the experienced hiker, who started hiking the Appalachian Trail in April of that year, never made it to the mountain's summit and was found dead of exposure 26 days later, reports the Bangor Daily News. Her husband reported her missing the next day, and the Maine Warden Service yesterday released its report on the case, which includes texts from the 62-year-old's phone to him and details of her last days in the forest. Among the revelations: She set up a campsite, made a flag out of a branch and shirt and tried to start a fire, kept food wrappers from her dwindling supply in a latrine, and wrote what might have been her last words on the cover of a journal: \"George please read. Xoxo.\" She was just a 10-minute walk from a dirt trail that turns into a road, and wardens found a rosary among her possessions. \"This is some of the worst country in Maine,\" says the head of a search firm. \"It's hard to understand how logistically",

Ultimately, many economists say, the sovereign debt of Greece and some other countries will have to be restructured, with their creditors accepting a discount on the debts\u2019 face value. European officials have so far sought to avoid taking that step. \n \n \u201cIf Europe comes together with an appropriate framework, that will enable a default to be avoided,\u201d said Joseph E. Stiglitz , the Nobel-winning economist. \u201cBut there\u2019s every sign that Europe won\u2019t do that, so the likelihood of a problem down the line is very significant.\u201d \n \n Kenneth S.

But as long as Greece doesn\u2019t grow briskly for a sustained period, it\u2019s in hot water.\u201d \n \n Hope is also in short supply among many Greeks, who said that the first round of austerity imposed after Greece\u2019s first bailout last year had worsened rather than improved their plight, and that the second round demanded even deeper cuts in many areas. \n \n \u201cOf course things will get worse,\u201d said Thimios Vilias, 35, who said his two-year contract at an insurance company would run out soon and who came out to protest on Wednesday. \u201cThe measures won\u2019t do any good for Greece. We have more debt, more debt, more debt, and we have no work,\u201d Mr. Vilias added. \n \n Video \n \n The measures approved on Wednesday will at least on paper lead to the dismantling of a big part of the economy\u2019s state-run sector. They call for the privatization of 50 billion euros, or about $72 billion, in state assets, including ports, telecommunications concerns, real estate and stakes in the public power corporation. \n \n They also include one billion euros, or about $1.4 billion, in cuts in the defense sector over the next five years; more than two billion euros, or $2.9 billion, in cuts to the health sector through 2015 by reducing regulated prices for drugs; tax increases on heating oil and the self-employed; and a shrinking of permanent and temporary public-sector employment. \n \n They do not, however, provide for changing the Greek Constitution, which states that public-sector workers on permanent contracts have lifetime tenure. Since last year, Greece has cut the wages of its 800,000 public workers \u2014 a quarter of the work force \u2014 by more than 10 percent. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Greece's parliament looked increasingly likely to approve unpopular austerity measures on Wednesday, despite violent protests, to secure international funds to prevent the euro zone's first sovereign default. \n \n ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek police firing tear gas fought running battles with stone-throwing protesters outside parliament on Wednesday as signs grew the government would succeed in pushing through an austerity plan demanded by creditors. \n \n With Greece risking bankruptcy if the measures are blocked, parliament was due to vote in the afternoon on the mix of spending cuts, tax increases and privatizations to be implemented as conditions for a massive bailout by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. \n \n Tens of thousands of protesters, many of them waving Greek flags and beating drums, packed Syntagma Square outside parliament as a 48-hour general strike that began on Tuesday brought central Athens to a standstill. \n \n \"Dissolve parliament,\" read one banner. \n \n Demonstrations turned violent for a second day when a surge in the crowd overturned metal barriers, forcing back a line of riot police, who responded with flash bombs and tear gas. \n \n \"Cops, pigs, murderers!\" chanted the crowd at a line of white-helmeted riot police as tear gas projectiles turned the air outside parliament white. A line of protesters joined hands in a traditional Greek dance in front of police lines. \n \n Inside parliament, the government of Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou inched closer to securing the majority it needs to pass the law as a member of the conservative opposition said she would vote for the 28 billion euro ($39.7 billion) package. \n \n Late on Tuesday, one of three rebel Socialist (PASOK) lawmakers climbed down, saying he would support the measures. \n \n \"I have made the decision to vote for the plan because national interests are more important than our own dignity,\" the deputy, Thomas Robopoulos, told Reuters. \n \n A parliamentary official said the vote would probably take place between 2 and 5 p.m. (1100-1400 GMT). \n \n One communist deputy was pelted with yoghurt as protesters tried to block several avenues around parliament to prevent the vote. At least three people were treated for minor injuries as protesters skirmished with police. \n \n The communist-affiliated PAME labor group held a rally in the morning and several other meetings were expected during the day, culminating in a major demonstration by public service union ADEDY and private sector union GSEE at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT). \n \n Greece's central bank governor, George Provopoulos, warned that a \"no\" vote would be suicidal for Greece. \n \n \"For parliament to vote against this package would be a crime - the country would be voting for its suicide,\" he told the Financial Times. \n \n BITTER RESENTMENT \n \n The measures demanded by international lenders as the price for continuing to support Athens have wrought bitter resentment in a Greek population coping with the deepest recession since the 1970s and now facing years of grim austerity. \n \n Another PASOK rebel, Panagiotis Kouroublis, said he still objected to the plan but declined to say whether he would vote against it. \"I will speak to the parliament later and you will hear what I have to say,\" he told Alter TV. \"Nothing is more important than my dignity and my love for my country.\" \n \n The Socialists hold a narrow majority with 155 seats in the 300-member legislature and with Robopoulos, the most prominent of a handful of potential rebels, backtracking on his opposition, chances of the vote going through improved. \n \n In a sign of growing optimism on financial markets about the outcome, Greek bank stocks opened up 3 percent on Wednesday, while Greek bond yields fell. \n \n However, even with approval on Wednesday, there will still be a risk of lawmakers rejecting detailed austerity bills in votes on Thursday on the implementation of different elements of the plan, such as tax rises and the sale of state assets. \n \n \"Will there be a way to compensate households for the heating fuel increase? Will there be exemptions for agriculture to help it be competitive? I am waiting for answers to see what I will do in the implementation law,\" said Socialist MP Mihalis Tzelepis, reflecting the anger within the party. \n \n The EU and the IMF have said the entire plan must be passed this week for Greece to obtain the next, 12 billion euro ($17.3 billion) tranche of emergency loans under the bailout. \n \n Greek officials have said the country needs the money by mid-July to continue paying its debts. \n \n Despite heavy international pressure, the center-right opposition declared it would vote against the package but close attention was being paid to a splinter group of conservative deputies led by former foreign minister Dora Bakoyanis. \n \n Bakoyanis, who broke party ranks to vote in favor of Greece's first EU/IMF bailout last year, said on Wednesday she would abstain from voting this time. The other four deputies in her group would vote according to their consciences. \n \n \"The government cannot govern and apply the program and the political opposition is lying, this is the problem. It does not dare to tell people that there are no magic solutions, that sacrifices are necessary,\" Bakoyanis said. \n \n (Additional reporting by George Georgiopoulos and Ingrid Melander; writing by James Mackenzie and Daniel Flynn; editing by Mark Heinrich)",

But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. \n \n The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. \n \n \u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201d \n \n The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. \n \n The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump.

Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201d \n \n In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. \n \n But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion. \n \n Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. \n \n Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years. \n \n The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. \n \n Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. \n \n One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B.

Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson such as Social Security and Medicare. \n \n In the election, Republicans kept their tight grip on the House and outmaneuvered the Democrats for a slim majority in the Senate. In less than three weeks, on the West Front of the Capitol, Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the presidential oath to Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s newfound ally. \n \n Advertisement \n \n First up for Republicans is repeal and delay of the health care law, expediting the process for scrapping Obama\u2019s major overhaul but holding off on some changes for up to four years. The tax code is in the cross-hairs. Conservatives want to scuttle rules on the environment and undo financial regulations created in the aftermath of the 2008 economic meltdown, arguing they are too onerous for businesses to thrive. \n \n The only obstacle to the far-reaching conservative agenda will be Senate Democrats who hold the power to filibuster legislation, but even that has its political limitations.

Once sworn in, Ryan will then administer the oath to the House members. \n \n The GOP will hold a hefty 241-194 majority in the House, including 52 freshmen \u2014 27 Republicans, including Wyoming\u2019s Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, and 25 Democrats. \n \n Confirming the Cabinet \n \n The Senate will exercise its advice and consent role and consider nominations of 15 department secretaries and six people tapped by Trump to lead agencies or serve in roles with Cabinet-level status, such as the EPA and UN ambassador. \n \n Democrats won\u2019t make it easy. \n \n Several in the party have been highly critical of several of Trump\u2019s choices, from Rick Perry, who forgot during the 2012 presidential campaign that the Energy Department was the one he wanted to eliminate, to Treasury pick Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive whom Democrats have dubbed the \u2018\u2018foreclosure king\u2019\u2019 for his stake in OneWest Bank that profited from the foreclosure crisis. \n \n Others nominees, such as retired Marine General James Mattis for defense secretary, should easily win confirmation. First, though, Congress must pass a law allowing the former military man to serve in a civilian post. \n \n There is a limit to what Democrats can do. Rules changes in 2013 allow some nominees, including Cabinet picks, to be confirmed with a simple majority, preventing Democrats from demanding 60 votes to move forward. \n \n Supreme Court vacancy \n \n Adding to the drama of the new Congress will be high-profile confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court. \n \n Justice Antonin Scalia died last February and Republicans refused to consider Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, insisting that the next president should fill the high court vacancy that\u2019s now lasted more than 10 months. \n \n Trump released a list of potential choices during the campaign that included Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who clerked for Justice Samuel Alito. Since the election, the president-elect also has met with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who clerked for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, prompting talk about a possible nomination for the onetime presidential rival. \n \n Trump has said he wants to nominate a justice who would help overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion. Cruz and Lee would fulfill that pledge. \n \n New face in leadership \n \n The point man for Senate Democrats is Brooklyn-born Chuck Schumer, who will be a chief antagonist to fellow New Yorker Trump. \n \n Schumer succeeds Nevada\u2019s Harry Reid, who retired after five terms, and joins Congress\u2019 top leaders \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Speaker Ryan \u2014 in what is certain to be tough negotiations next year on spending and policies. \n \n Russian hacking \n \n The first public hearing on the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia interfered in the US election is Thursday in the Senate Armed Services Committee, with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, set to testify. Expect individual panels to investigate, but not a special, high-profile select committee. McConnell has rejected that bipartisan call. ||||| Energised Republicans are set to begin dismantling eight years of achievements by Barack Obama as they take complete control of Washington and bring out the wrecking balls. \n \n The 115th Congress will sit for the first time on Tuesday, and even before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, Republicans on Capitol Hill are anxious to start work. Their priorities include repealing the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, a tax overhaul, the repeal of environmental regulations, a large transportation bill to create jobs, and the confirmation of a new Supreme Court justice. \n \n \u201cBuckle up,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told his former colleagues in the House last year, after meeting with them to discuss legislative plans. \n \n Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell do not agree on everything (AP) \n \n \u201cI\u2019m very confident that as we move towards inauguration, bring together a great team, work in concert with leaders in the House and Senate, and we\u2019re going to move an agenda that\u2019s going to rebuild our military, revive our economy, and \u2014 in a word \u2014 make America great again.\u201d \n \n Indeed, with the Republicans controlling both the executive and legislative branches of government, work is likely to begin shortly after the Congress\u2019s 59 new members \u2014 seven senators and fifty-two House members \u2014 are sworn in. \n \n CNN said that the Republicans will want to begin dismantling Obamacare, which they have identified as a priority since it was passed into law in 2010. \n \n Happy new year! 2017 is going to be a big year for our nation. \u2014 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) January 1, 2017 \n \n They also plan a major tax overhaul and the the reversal of a number of Obama-era environmental regulations. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told The New York Times. \u201cAnd we intend to do it.\u201d \n \n \u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said recently, \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201d \n \n Trump's advisor suggests Obama's sanctions against Russia are to 'box in' the incoming President \n \n At the same time, such legislative efforts will have to share time with Senate confirmation hearings for Mr Trump\u2019s cabinet picks in the days and months that follow the President-elect\u2019s swearing-in. \n \n It should be easier for Republicans to move nominations after the Democrats changed the Senate's filibuster rules in 2013. Still, Democrats have pledged to fight many of the nominations, highlighting what they call the hypocrisy of Mr Trump\u2019s populist message. \n \n In truth, the Democrats, weakened in all areas of government since last November\u2019s election, have little ammunition with which to fire back. \n \n But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will likely try and stop changes to welfare programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid. \n \n Mr Obama is himself scheduled to visit congressional Democrats on Wednesday to discuss ways to try and save his signature legislation. \n \n There is much that remains unclear. And there are a number of issues on which Republicans on Capitol Hill are at odds with Mr Trump. They do not agree on his wish to scrap trade deals such as Nafta, and they also do not see eye to eye with him over controversies such as the alleged Russian cyber-meddling in the election. \n \n While Mr Trump has said he thinks the country needs to move on to \u201cmore important\u201d issues, Republican senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain have called for hearings on the issue and proposed sanctions beyond those announced by Mr Obama last week. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) - An aggressive campaign by Republicans to dismantle eight years of President Barack Obama's Democratic policies is ready for launch. \n \n \n \n Members of the 115th Congress will be sworn in at noon Tuesday, setting off the GOP's pursuit of a conservative agenda. \n \n \n \n One of the most immediate targets is Obama's health care law. Republicans have long sought to gut the statute and have blamed the law as a primary cause for a lackluster economic recovery. \n \n \n \n But decades-old programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, also will be in the crosshairs as Republicans aim to shrink both the size of the federal budget and the bureaucracy in Washington. \n \n \n \n Democrats will try to block the GOP's agenda by swaying public opinion and using the power they have in the Senate to filibuster legislation. ||||| A Republican-controlled Congress opens Tuesday with the most sweeping conservative agenda in decades, providing Donald Trump ample room to gut the Affordable Care Act, slash corporate tax rates and undo Obama-era environmental regulations. \n \n The House is almost certain to reelect Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) as its first order of business, dispensing with the messy political infighting that has hobbled Republicans in the past. \n \n And the Senate will swiftly begin vetting the president-elect\u2019s most controversial Cabinet picks, ready to confirm some when Trump is inaugurated as president on Jan. 20. \n \n Yet Republicans remain at odds on some high-profile issues \u2014 such as how aggressively to investigate Russian hacking in the 2016 election \u2014 and how to fulfill other big-ticket promises, such as replacing Obamacare. \n \n Despite firm Republican control of both the White House and Congress, the internal disputes have left them without a clear plan yet for Trump\u2019s first 100 days, or an endgame for the two years of the 115th Congress. \n \n Trump\u2019s often shifting views on major issues will test relations with GOP\u2019s leaders on Capitol Hill, and his willingness to skirt ideological rigidity gives incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco an opening to influence and shape the president\u2019s evolving agenda. \n \n President Obama will visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Democrats bracing for their new role, not just as the minority party, but as the main roadblock preventing Trump from dismantling the healthcare law and other parts of the Obama agenda. \n \n Republicans will also assemble behind closed doors. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was a popular conservative congressman before he was elected governor of Indiana, is likely to serve as a crucial link between the Trump administration and its allies in Congress. \n \n Given Trump\u2019s inexperience in government, Pence is expected to play an enhanced role, perhaps like the one former Vice President Richard Cheney held under President George W. Bush. \n \n At a minimum, Pence could provide a vital conduit between the untested new president and his more ideological party members in Congress, especially as Ryan\u2019s own relationship with Trump has been strained. \n \n Ryan flip-flopped over Trump \u2014 first withholding his endorsement, then ultimately campaigning for him \u2014 but the speaker insists he and the president-elect have let bygones pass as they talk almost daily on their plans for fulfilling Republican promises to voters. \n \n \u201cVery soon after the race, Donald and I said: \u2018Look, this is fantastic. We have so much to do. Let's forget about, you know, any differences in the past and let's get working on this agenda,\u2019\u201d Ryan said recently on Fox News. \u201cAnd that's exactly what we've been doing from -- that day on.\u201d \n \n Once Trump takes office, Republicans will face enormous pressure to score some legislative wins after six years of trying to block most of Obama\u2019s initiatives. \n \n Lawmakers will vote this week on low-hanging fruit -- a popular GOP measure to rein in the executive branch by requiring congressional approval for new federal regulations with an economic impact of more than $100 million. \n \n The measure, which passed the Republican House three times since 2011, is a GOP priority. Its supporters say it would have prevented nearly all the climate and employment rule changes of the Obama era. \n \n Republicans are also expected to punish Democrats for last year\u2019s gun control sit-in, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), by imposing new rules that would slap up to $2,500 fines on lawmakers who film such floor protests from smartphones or other devices. \n \n Whether that would pass judicial review is less clear. Opponents say the proposed ban is clearly unconstitutional. \n \n But the GOP\u2019s top promise \u2014 to end Obamacare \u2014 remains a tough haul. \n \n Votes are expected in coming days on legislation to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. But these first steps will be largely symbolic while lawmakers debate the details of dismantling the healthcare law. \n \n With 20 million Americans now benefiting from Obamacare, the GOP\u2019s gutting of it comes with an asterisk. \n \n Republicans are also likely to postpone fully dismantling the healthcare law until they can sort out their own ideas for a yet-to-be-determined alternative. \n \n That could push a full Obamacare repeal and replace until 2018 or 2019, after the midterm elections. \n \n \u201cRepeal and delay, it doesn\u2019t even have alliteration,\u201d Pelosi scoffed on a conference call Monday with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an admission that it\u2019s a lot for them to lose politically.\u201d \n \n Similarly, Republicans are still working out the details of tax reform beyond the lower rates proposed in the House GOP\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d blueprint agenda for the new year. \n \n Ryan will almost certainly reemerge as speaker in Tuesday\u2019s floor vote. But his leadership remains constrained by the same internal party divisions that hobbled his predecessor, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), and that have prevented Republicans from making gains on a cohesive agenda. \n \n Those divisions surfaced late Monday when Republicans split during a closed-door session over a proposal to gut a congressional ethics office at a time when Trump has promised to come to Washington and \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Approval of the proposal signaled a rocky start to the new session. ||||| Early morning traffic rolls toward the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 14, 2016. (Photo: J. David Ake, AP) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Bills to block or roll back federal regulations, initially conceived by Republicans as a check on President Obama\u2019s power, are high on the agenda when the House returns to Washington this week and the changes could become reality shortly after the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. \n \n The 115th Congress begins Tuesday with a Republican majority in the House and Senate preparing for the arrival of a Republican president for the first time in eight years. \n \n The House is expected to take up two bills \u2014 the Midnight Rules Act and the REINS Act (which stands for Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny) \u2014 that passed on largely party-line votes in the 114th, 113th and 112th congressional sessions, but died in the Senate. The REINS Act would require that before any new major regulation could take effect, the House and Senate would have to pass a resolution of approval. The Midnight Rules Act would let Congress invalidate rules in bulk that passed in the final year of a presidential term. \n \n The House is also expected to consider a nonbinding resolution disapproving the Dec. 23 United Nations Security Council vote that called on Israel to stop building settlements in the West Bank. The United States abstained in that vote, allowing the measure to pass. \n \n Regulations are adopted by the executive branch to implement laws passed by Congress and signed by the president. Congress already has the power to repeal laws by passing a new bill and getting the president to sign it. And under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass a resolution of disapproval to block a rule if it acts within 60 days of notification from an agency. \n \n The new legislation would further expand congressional power by preventing an administration from implementing rules without another vote. Under the REINS act, a proposed regulation would be deemed rejected if Congress was in session for 70 days and took no action. The bill allows for a major rule to take effect for a single 90-day period if the president determined it was necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency. \n \n \u201cOur federal agencies are out of control, and Congress is partly to blame for that,\u201d the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said in a release last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve ceded our legislative responsibility to agencies that were never intended to make laws, and the result has been redundant, counterproductive rules that have massive impacts on our economy.\u201d \n \n Read more: \n \n When the House considered the Midnight Rules Act in November, the White House said it would recommend that Obama veto it. Trump, however, has taken a page from the conservative playbook and blamed government regulations for holding down economic growth and job creation. He has pledged to eliminate two regulations for every new one adopted during his presidency. \n \n The REINS Act and Midnight Rules Act are aimed at major rules. An April 2015 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office said are those that meet one of these conditions: an economic impact of more than $100 million; cause significant price increases for consumers, industries, geographic regions or state or local governments; or have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity or foreign competition. \n \n The CBO said that over the past five years, 82 major rules have been adopted each year, on average. Blocking such regulations in the future would have \u201ca significant effect on direct spending,\u201d but CBO could not predict whether the effect would be positive or negative because it could not say whether Congress would block regulations to increase or decrease spending. \n \n Before the House voted on the final REINS Act in 2015, Democrats unsuccessfully tried to include amendments that would exempt rules that affected veterans health care, nuclear reactor safety, transportation of hazardous materials, and the safety of products used or consumed by children under the age of 2. Each attempt was rejected in a largely party-line vote. \n \n Critics say the changes would endanger the public and worsen gridlock in government. \n \n \u201cRegulations are public protections that are intended to safeguard regular citizens from dealing with unclean air and water, financial crises and unsafe products,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, director of the CongressWatch program at Public Citizen. \u201cThey are intended to protect us, and to do away with them wholesale is an extremely problematic approach.\u201d \n \n Gilbert said that while no one would argue every regulation is perfect, the changes Congress seeks to make would effectively stymie future rulemaking and allow Congress to erase actions the Obama administration took since the summer. She said she hoped there would be enough votes in the Senate to sustain a filibuster on the Midnight Rules bill, but on the REINS Act, \u201cit\u2019s possible there could be a path\u201d for it to pass. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hKrOZv ||||| House Speaker Paul Ryan with Melania and Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol after the election. \n \n The Washington, D.C. beat in 2017 is going to revolve around covering a Republican Party that holds the White House and both chambers of Congress for the first time since 2006. \n \n In those 10 years, Republicans have amassed a wish list of things they\u2019d like to get done. Now\u2019s their chance to tackle that list, and the story of 2017 in Washington will be how much progress they make toward those goals, and how effective Democrats will be in blocking them. \n \n The Senate will be the site of most contention over the GOP\u2019s agenda, because Democrats have the procedural tools (like the filibuster) and numbers required to fight back. Republicans will hold 52 seats to Democrats\u2019 46, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence as the tie-breaker. \n \n In the House of Representatives, the GOP will retain a comfortable majority, holding 241 seats to Democrats\u2019 194. That chamber has more scheduled days of legislative work than any year since 2010 \u2014 a reflection of how productive a Congress leaders are imagining next year. \n \n Democrats have said they\u2019ll work with President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans where they can, but expect more partisan fireworks than friendly cooperation next year. \n \n Also, don\u2019t expect Trump and Republicans in Congress \u2014 many of whom kept him at arm\u2019s length or openly criticized him during the campaign \u2014 to always agree, either. \n \n Here are five big GOP agenda items I\u2019ll be watching closely: \n \n 1. Obamacare \n \n It\u2019s the big one, the top of the GOP wish list since 2010, the one thing that Republicans believe they must do in the 115th Congress: dismantling the Affordable Care Act. \n \n Congressional Republicans have been champing at the bit to get rid of President Obama\u2019s signature achievement since its passage, voting numerous times on symbolic repeal measures in the House of Representatives. \n \n Angry protest votes were easy enough. Now, with control of the necessary levers of power, comes the hard part for the GOP: figuring out a way to not just repeal Obamacare, but replace it with something else. \n \n The repeal part is relatively simple. GOP leaders forecast a vote to repeal Obamacare as soon as February, which would easily clear the House. In the Senate, Republican leaders will likely use budget reconciliation \u2014 the same tactic Democrats used to pass the law in the first place \u2014 to ensure a repeal only needs a simple majority of the Senate, not a 60-vote majority. \n \n The replacement will be much harder, in policy and logistics. Earlier this year, Speaker Paul Ryan outlined a plan aiming to make health coverage more affordable through expanding health savings accounts and allowing the purchase of coverage across state lines, among other things. \n \n There is disagreement in the party about whether a repeal should be pursued before a replacement is hammered out. But key leaders are coalescing around a plan that would repeal Obamacare soon and then allow two to four years to figure out a replacement, setting up a potential deadline down the road. (D.C.\u2019s already calling it the \u201chealth care cliff.\u201d) \n \n Minnesota\u2019s Republican representatives all want to see the law gone. Incoming Rep. Jason Lewis made opposition to Obamacare a key plank of his winning campaign in the 2nd District. Rep. Tom Emmer said he expects Obamacare will be toast by February, but said the party needs to proceed with caution in its replacement plans. \n \n How Republicans address Obamacare will be the story not just of 2017, but probably 2018 and 2019, too. \n \n 2. Tax reform \n \n Republicans and Democrats have been talking about working on comprehensive tax reform for years. In 2017, those proposals will take on a decidedly more conservative tack. \n \n Broadly, GOP leaders want to lower individual and corporate income tax rates, with a strong focus on the latter: the Ways and Means Committee, which sets taxation policy, has already drawn up a proposal to reduce corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent. \n \n On other tax issues, Republicans are going to reach for long-held goals. They likely will take aim at the estate tax, which Trump, Ryan, and other GOP leaders want to get rid of. Most Democrats are loath to drop the tax, which would cost about $200 billion over a decade. In a vote in the House last year, only seven Democrats joined Republicans to repeal it. \n \n It\u2019s possible Democrats may not be able to put up much resistance to any of these measures. The budget reconciliation tactic is typically meant to reconcile tax legislation with budget legislation, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he expects that is how tax reform bills will move in the next Congress. \n \n The member to watch on tax issues will be GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen: the only Minnesotan to serve on Ways and Means, Paulsen has floated an array of tax and health care policy tweaks over the years. \n \n 3. Entitlement reform \n \n Any movement from the GOP on Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security could bring some of the messiest politics of 2017. \n \n It is no secret that Republicans would like to \u201crestructure\u201d Medicare, the government\u2019s program to cover seniors\u2019 health care, and Medicaid, which covers low-income people, in order to reduce the programs\u2019 costs. Medicare and Medicaid cost over $1 trillion in 2016 and cover more than 120 million people. \n \n The GOP has long wanted to give states money for Medicaid in the form of block grants; they\u2019ve also pushed varying degrees of privatization for Medicare. Trump\u2019s nomination of Georgia GOP Rep. Tom Price, a very conservative voice on health care, as Secretary of Health and Human Services has only added to speculation. \n \n In November, Price suggested that a long-desired Medicare reform \u2014 a voucher program to let patients use government money to participate in a private plan instead of Medicare \u2014 could be included as a rider on a budget bill. \n \n On Social Security, the Republican chair of the Ways and Means Social Security subcommittee floated a bill that would restructure the program. It includes a raise of the retirement age, an idea favored by many conservatives. \n \n Perhaps more than any others, entitlement issues are political third rails in Congress. They will not be as far up on the agenda as Obamacare, but Paul Ryan and others have been itching to take a crack at them for years. They now have the chance. \n \n But this is a fight Democrats relish, and talking points they\u2019re deeply comfortable with. Setting the battle lines for 2017, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has already declared a GOP \u201cwar on seniors.\u201d \n \n In entitlement debates, watch Democratic Reps. Rick Nolan and Keith Ellison, two of the most vocal opponents to GOP policy in either chamber. \n \n 4. Wall Street reform rollback \n \n Trump\u2019s populist appeal was bolstered by his calls to take on Wall Street. But Republicans in Congress see an opportunity to pass long-awaited measure to deregulate the financial sector, particularly a rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform package. \n \n A repeal of the entire law, which is 2,300 pages and incredibly complex, probably won\u2019t happen this Congress. \n \n But Republicans could chip away at pillars of Dodd-Frank, like the so-called \u201cVolcker rule,\u201d which prevents big banks from making certain kinds of risky investments. They also will likely target the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, defanging it by replacing its director with a board and by giving Congress control over its budget. \n \n Emmer, a vocal critic of Dodd-Frank, is on the House Financial Services panel, and could play a role in this debate. Ellison, a staunch defender of the CFPB and Wall Street regulation, is also on that committee, and could figure prominently into the debate as well, if he retains his congressional seat. \n \n 5. Energy and environmental deregulation \n \n Among most congressional Republicans, Obama\u2019s actions to tackle climate change were anathema. With a man friendly to the fossil fuels industry and skeptical of climate science moving into the White House, Republicans are now eyeing a few areas where they might be able to roll back Obama\u2019s environmental policies in Congress. \n \n Since Trump\u2019s election, the Obama administration has been working frantically to complete 11th hour regulations on climate and environmental protection. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress has 60 days to disapprove a regulation from the executive branch \u2014 so the 115th Congress could get to work undoing those rules, if it acts swiftly. \n \n That process would take some work, but it\u2019s feasible. Potential targets of a GOP effort include a rule from the Department of the Interior to reduce methane emissions on public lands, or even the recent rule to block Twin Metals from its leases to copper and nickel deposits near Minnesota\u2019s Boundary Waters. \n \n Environmentalists worry that Congress could act to make big amendments to existing law like the Clean Air Act, such as excluding carbon dioxide as a regulated pollutant. \n \n Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, the ranking member on the Appropriations subcommittee that deals with interior issues, is one to watch on these issues.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The 115th Congress will be sworn in at noon Tuesday, per WXYZ, which anticipates \"an aggressive campaign\" by Republicans to take down eight years' worth of President Obama's policies. The station adds that Democrats are ready to fight back by \"swaying public opinion\" and using their filibuster in the Senate. What else to look for Tuesday: Both the Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe predict an easy re-election of Paul Ryan as speaker of the House. Once Ryan retakes the helm, he'll oversee the oath administration to House members. The vetting process will begin in the Senate for some of President-elect Trump's more eyebrow-raising administration picks, including \"foreclosure king\" Steve Mnuchin, tapped as Treasury chief, and Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil CEO with questionable ties to Russia in line to be secretary of state. One confirmation expected to sail through: retired Gen. James Mattis for defense secretary. The biggest hunk on the legislative chopping block: ObamaCare. But the Times notes any immediate moves against the health care law would be \"largely symbolic\" as the GOP scrambles to work out the details and come up with their own alternative\u2014which means a full repeal might not happen until after midterm elections. Blocking or pulling back on regulations will be another priority of the Congress, per USA Today, with a bill expected that would give the GOP-controlled Congress approval power over any new federal regulations, as well as a \"Midnight Rules Act\" that would give Congress sway to nullify in bulk any rules passed during a president's final year in office. Citizens are nervously watching the outcome for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, with MinnPost noting that \"any movement from the GOP\" in terms of entitlement reform \"could bring some of the messiest politics of 2017.\" Also on deck: a major tax revamp, the dismantling of Obama-placed environmental regulations, and the nomination of a Supreme Court justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia, per the Independent. \"It's a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday, per the New York Times. \"And we intend to do it.\" Not that the Republicans' hold on Congress guarantees a unified GOP front: The Times notes \"internal disputes\" have resulted in no \"clear plan yet for Trump's first 100 days, or an endgame for the two years of the 115th Congress.\" Also complicating matters for the GOP: the president-elect's \"often shifting views\" on big issues and a \"willingness to skirt ideological rigidity.\" (Also on the Congress itinerary for Tuesday: a vote on a proposal to \"effectively kill\" the Office of Congressional Ethics.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 It's the first Monday in January, and that means it's time for the 115th Congress to be sworn in. Among the items on that list: Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans will likely use the obscure Congressional Review Act to try to undo as many regulations as they can within the first 60 legislative days of the rules' completion. They'll likely focus on measures to reduce methane gases, make mining and fossil fuel companies disclose their payments to foreign governments, and restrict pesticide use. The Washington Post predicts that Trump will use the \"power of the pen\" to undo many of the regulations put in place by President Obama and his Democratic allies. The Senate will have a 52-48 advantage, with seven new Democrats and 21 women among the 21 returning senators. The GOP will hold a 241-194 majority in the House, with 27 Republicans, including Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, and 25 Democrats. Paul Ryan will administer the oath of office to members of the House at noon on Wednesday.",

Here's what else you need to know: The GOP controls the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time since Bill Clinton's presidency, and the Washington Post predicts that Trump will use the \"power of the pen\" to undo many of the regulations put in place by President Obama and his Democratic allies. A roundup of coverage: The Wall Street Journal \u2013 It's the first Monday in January, and that means it's time for the New York Times to round up what's on the agenda for the 115th Congress, which will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Among the items on the to-do list: Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans will likely use the obscure Congressional Review Act to try to undo as many regulations as they can within the first 60 legislative days of the rules' completion. They'll likely focus on measures to reduce methane gases, make mining and fossil fuel companies disclose their payments to foreign governments, and restrict pesticide use \u2013 The 115th Congress is sworn in Tuesday at noon on the West Front of the Capitol, with Vice President Joe Biden administering the oath of office to 27 returning senators and seven new ones, as well as to Paul Ryan, who will once again be speaker of the House. The New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Washington Post round up some things to know about the new legislative session, which will include action on repealing and delaying President Obama's health care law, tackling the tax code, and more. The Senate will have a 52-48 advantage, with seven new Democrats and 21 women among the 21 returning senators. \u2013 It's going to be a busy week on Capitol Hill. Here's a look at what's to come: Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States as Paul Ryan takes the oath of office at noon on Wednesday, the New York Times reports. Ryan will then administer the oath to members of the House of Representatives, who will outnumber senators by more than 2-to-1. The GOP will hold a 241-194 majority in the House, with 27 Republicans, including Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, and 25 Democrats. The Senate will hold confirmation hearings for Trump's Cabinet \u2013 The 115th Congress convenes Tuesday, and even before Donald Trump is sworn in, the New York Times predicts that \"work is likely to begin shortly after the Congress's 59 new members\u2014seven senators and fifty-two House members\u2014are sworn in.\" Among the items on the GOP's to-do list: repeal and replace ObamaCare, a tax overhaul, a repeal of environmental regulations, a bill to create jobs, and the confirmation of a new Supreme Court justice.

The Los Angeles Times takes a look at what's at stake if Republicans fail to come up with a spending plan before the deadline \u2013 The 115th Congress convenes Tuesday with Republicans in control of both the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade. Here's a look at what's to come: The New York Times predicts that the \"most sweeping conservative agenda in decades\" will be on the table as Republicans aim to repeal and replace President Obama's health care law, slash corporate tax rates, and undo environmental regulations. They'll also try to shrink both the federal budget and the bureaucracy in Washington. The Los Angeles Times looks at the \"messaging political infighting that has hobbled Republicans in the past\" and predicts that \u2013 It's the first Monday in January, which means it's time for the new Congress to get to work. Here's what you need to know: House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to return to his position as the chamber's No. 2 Republican, which could make it easier for him to work with President-elect Donald Trump, the New York Times reports. But there's still a lot of figuring out to be done before that happens, including repealing and replacing ObamaCare. The Washington Post looks at the \"big to-do\" items on the GOP agenda for the first 100 days of the new year \u2013 The 115th Congress convenes Tuesday with Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time in eight years, the Washington Post reports. According to USA Today, the agenda for the new Congress includes bills that would give Congress more power to block or roll back federal regulations. Two of the bills are the Midnight Rules Act and the REINS Act, which stands for Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny. \u201cOur federal agencies are out of control, and Congress is partly to blame for that,\u201d the bill's sponsor says. \u201cWe\u2019ve ceded our legislative responsibility to agencies \u2013 \"We've ceded our legislative responsibility to agencies that were never intended to make laws, and the result has been redundant, counterproductive rules that have massive impacts on our economy.\" Those are the words of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who's hoping to make good on President Trump's promise to get rid of two regulations for every new one put in place by President Obama. The GOP is working on two pieces of legislation: the Midnight Rules Act and the REINS Act, which USA Today describes as \"aimed at major rules.\" The latter would block any new regulations that cost more than $100 million in economic \u2013 With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress for the first time in a decade, what's on the GOP's \"wish list\" for the 115th Congress?

Now that they have control of both houses of Congress, Republicans are expected to vote to repeal ObamaCare as soon as February, and a replacement is expected to take two to four years. The \u2013 With Donald Trump in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate, what's in store for Washington in 2017? Here's a look at some of the biggest issues on the agenda: Health care: Republicans want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act as soon as possible, and Minnesota's Republican Rep. Jason Lewis, who defeated Democratic Rep. Tom Emmer in November, said he believes the law will be gone by February, the Star Tribune reports. How Republicans do so is expected to be a major focus of 2017.

    "document": "Abstract \n \n Background\u2014Americans have a shorter life expectancy compared with residents of almost all other high-income countries. We aim to estimate the impact of lifestyle factors on premature mortality and life expectancy in the US population. \n \n Methods\u2014Using data from the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2014; n=78 865) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014, n=44 354), we defined 5 low-risk lifestyle factors as never smoking, body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, \u226530 min/d of moderate to vigorous physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, and a high diet quality score (upper 40%), and estimated hazard ratios for the association of total lifestyle score (0-5 scale) with mortality. We used data from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys; 2013-2014) to estimate the distribution of the lifestyle score and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database to derive the agespecific death rates of Americans. We applied the life table method to estimate life expectancy by levels of the lifestyle score. \n \n Results\u2014During up to 34 years of follow-up, we documented 42 167 deaths. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in adults with 5 compared with zero low-risk factors were 0.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.31) for all-cause mortality, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.27-0.45) for cancer mortality, and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.12-0.26) for cardiovascular disease mortality. The population-attributable risk of nonadherence to 5 low-risk factors was 60.7% (95% CI, 53.6-66.7) for all-cause mortality, 51.7% (95% CI, 37.1-62.9) for cancer mortality, and 71.7% (95% CI, 58.1-81.0) for cardiovascular disease mortality. We estimated that the life expectancy at age 50 years was 29.0 years (95% CI, 28.3-29.8) for women and 25.5 years (95% CI, 24.7-26.2) for men who adopted zero low-risk lifestyle factors. In contrast, for those who adopted all 5 low-risk factors, we projected a life expectancy at age 50 years of 43.1 years (95% CI, 41.3-44.9) for women and 37.6 years (95% CI, 35.8-39.4) for men. The projected life expectancy at age 50 years was on average 14.0 years (95% CI, 11.8-16.2) longer among female Americans with 5 lowrisk factors compared with those with zero low-risk factors; for men, the difference was 12.2 years (95% CI, 10.1-14.2). \n \n Conclusions\u2014Adopting a healthy lifestyle could substantially reduce premature mortality and prolong life expectancy in US adults. ||||| This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records ||||| (CNN) Want to prolong your life expectancy by more than a decade? A new study suggests that you can do just that by following these five healthy habits: never smoke, maintain a healthy body-mass index, keep up moderate to vigorous exercise, don't drink too much alcohol, and eat a healthy diet. \n \n Adhering to those five lifestyle factors at age 50, compared with not adhering to any of them, was associated with 14 additional years of life expectancy among women and 12.2 additional years among men in the study, published in the journal Circulation on Monday. \n \n Each of those factors is significantly associated with a reduced risk of dying from the top two killers in the United States, cardiovascular disease and cancer , according to the study. \n \n About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the US each year, which is about one in every four deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n \n About 609,640 Americans are expected to die of cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society \n \n JUST WATCHED Life expectancy on the rise Replay More Videos ...

Chan School of Public Health , who was a co-author of the study. \n \n \"We can do so much better for having a long healthy life by pretty simple minimal changes in our behavior, and only 8% of adults in our country are adhering to these,\" he said. \"The main take-home message is that there's huge gains in health and longevity to be had just by simple changes in our behavior pattern, and as a country, I think we need to make it easier for ourselves to do this by promoting tobacco cessation, by providing better environments for physical activity and so on.\" \n \n Photos: The countries where people live longest Photos: The countries where people live longest Italy \u2013 The Italian diet, combined with a climate that promotes outdoor activity, is thought to play an important role in healthy aging among Italians.

The data came from 1980 to 2014 and included more than 122,000 people combined. \n \n Then, the researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to estimate the distribution of those modifiable lifestyle factors among adults in the United States. Those data, from 2013 to 2014, consisted of 2,128 adults, 50 to 80 years old. \n \n The researchers also derived death rates of US adults using the CDC's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database. \n \n After analyzing the data, the researchers found that, in 2014, the overall projected life expectancy at age 50 was to live 33.3 more years for women and 29.8 more years for men. \n \n Yet among the adults who reported that they adopted all five healthy lifestyle factors, the researchers found, they lived 43.1 more years among women and 37.6 more years among men. \n \n Among those adults who reported that they adhered to none of the five healthy lifestyle factors, the researchers found that they lived only 29 additional years among women and 25.5 additional years among men. \n \n \"To me, the surprising outcome was how strong it was: what a big impact these simple behaviors could have on life expectancy,\" Stampfer said. \"I was surprised that it was that pronounced.\" \n \n Among the women, on average, about 30.8% of the life expectancy at age 50 that they gained from adopting five, versus zero, of those lifestyle factors was attributed to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease death; 21.2% was attributed to a reduced risk of cancer and 48% to other causes of death. \n \n Among the men, those percentages were 34.1% attributed to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease death, 22.8% attributed to a reduced risk of cancer and 43.1% to other causes. \n \n The study had some limitations, including that the data on adherence to the five lifestyle factors were all self-reported, making outcome vulnerable to measurement errors. \n \n Also, the data analysis did not include measures of certain health conditions that are risk factors for a shorter life expectancy, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. \n \n That limitation, however, \"is both a strength and a limitation, in a way ... because what we're estimating here is the prolongation of life expectancy just based on behaviors,\" Stampfer said. \n \n \"Obviously, it's much better to do these healthy behaviors from childhood, really, but if you're beyond age 50, beyond age 60, beyond age 70, it's not too late,\" he added. \n \n The factor that was seen as more 'powerful' \n \n The findings should encourage and motivate people to adopt a healthier lifestyle, said Dr. Douglas Vaughan, chairman of the department of medicine in Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine , who was not involved in the study. \n \n Though the study highlighted how the combination of all five lifestyle factors could help prolong life expectancy, Vaughan pointed out how each individual factor also was tied to a reduced risk of premature death. \n \n JUST WATCHED Why your BMI matters Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why your BMI matters 01:17 \n \n \"It looks like cigarette smoking has a more powerful effect than the other lifestyle changes or behaviors. Certainly, maintaining a reasonable body-mass index is a great way to protect oneself against the development of diabetes,\" Vaughan said. \n \n Body-mass index, a calculation derived from a person's weight and height, is used as a screening tool for body fatness. A normal or healthy body-mass index is typically said to be between 18.5 and 24.9. \n \n \"So, in aggregate, we see the effect on longevity, but you can imagine it's largely through effects on cardiovascular risk and metabolic risk,\" Vaughan said. \"It suggests potentially at a defined point in life, say age 50, if you adhere to a healthy paradigm like this, you can have an impact on your longevity and on your health span.\" \n \n Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Dr. Jack Der-Sarkissian, a family medicine physician and assistant area medical director of Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center , called smoking \"the least-debated health risk factor.\" \n \n \"Beyond cancer risk, smoking contributes to lung disease, heart disease and diabetes. The study shows that even minimal smoking -- from one to 14 cigarettes a day -- is associated with increased death due to cancer and heart disease,\" said Der-Sarkissian, who was not involved in the new study. \n \n As for some of the other lifestyle factors, \"getting weight below a BMI of 30 appears to help considerably, according to the study. A higher body weight is linked to increased risk of diabetes and cancer, among other obesity-related conditions,\" he said. \"The study suggests physical activity of at least 30 minutes a day of moderate or vigorous activities, including brisk walking.\"",

More surprising is just how much of an effect those five combined factors have on longevity\u2014an extra 14 years for women and 12 for men, according to the study in Circulation. Researchers looked at about 30 years of data on more than 78,000 women and 44,000 men and found that those who were five-for-five on the aforementioned list had a significantly better life expectancy at age 50 than those who didn't abide by any of the healthy habits. For women, it meant an additional 43 years for the healthiest group, compared to 29 years. For men, it meant an additional 37.6 years, compared to 25.5 years. \u201cWhen we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer,\" says co-author Meir Stampfer, per the Guardian. \"But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was.\" The two big factors: Those with the healthiest lifestyles were less likely to get cancer or heart disease, notes CNN. The Harvard Gazette provides some specifics: Researchers defined regular exercise as 30 minutes or more per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity; moderate drinking is roughly one 5-ounce glass of wine per day for women and up to two for men; and the target body-mass index is between 18.5 and 24.9. Scientists say they undertook the study to better understand why the US has a shorter life expectancy (79.3 years) than most high-income countries.

Researchers found that people who adhered to all five factors lived 33.3 years longer on average than those who didn't. \"To me, the surprising outcome was how strong it was: What a big impact these simple behaviors could have on life expectancy,\" the lead researcher says. \"I was surprised that it was that pronounced.\" The study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, looked at data from more than 500,000 people over the age of 50 in the US. Researchers say the findings should encourage people to adopt a healthier lifestyle even if they're not yet in their 50s. \"It looks like cigarette smoking has a more powerful effect than the other lifestyle changes or behaviors,\" the chairman of the department of medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine tells CNN. \"Certainly, maintaining a reasonable body-Mass index is a great way to protect oneself against the development of diabetes.\"",

    "document": "Scott Wiener, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, made an unusual public announcement on Wednesday: He takes Truvada, a daily antiviral pill, to greatly reduce his risk of contracting H.I.V. \n \n Taking the pills is a practice known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, and some researchers believe it may reduce the risk of infection by 99 percent if patients take their medication daily as prescribed. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012, PrEP has increasingly been embraced by public health authorities and is one of three planks of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s plan in New York to sharply cut new H.I.V. infections. \n \n But it carries a stigma in some parts of the gay population, and Mr. Wiener appears to be the first public official to disclose that he\u2019s personally on it. ||||| Each morning, I take a pill called Truvada to protect me from becoming infected with HIV. This strategy, also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, reduces the risk of HIV infection by up to 99 percent if the pill is taken once a day. This makes PrEP one of the most effective HIV-prevention measures in existence. After consulting with my physician, I went on PrEP to further protect and take personal responsibility for my health. I'm HIV-negative, and I want to remain that way. \n \n I recently decided to be public about my use of PrEP in order to raise awareness about this relatively new tool for preventing HIV. It's important to encourage people at risk for HIV to talk to their medical providers about all the tools and methods available for preventing infection, including PrEP, and to choose the methods that are best for them. \n \n As an elected official, disclosing this personal health decision was a hard but necessary choice. After all these years, we still see enormous stigma, shame, and judgment around HIV, and around sexuality in general. That is precisely why I decided to be public about my choice: to contribute to a larger dialogue about our community's health. I have the honor of representing a district that includes the Castro -- ground zero for the HIV epidemic. I represent a community that has been profoundly impacted by HIV, with a large number of HIV-positive people -- nearly one in four gay men in San Francisco is HIV-positive -- and an even larger number of people at risk of becoming positive. As an elected official in this role, I have an obligation to do everything in my power to support those living with HIV, increase public awareness about effective HIV prevention, and reduce stigma and shame. \n \n My journey to PrEP was a long one. I came to terms with myself as a gay man when I was 17 years old in 1987, at the height of the HIV epidemic. Many gay men were getting sick and dying. Like many in my generation, I came of age associating sex with illness and death. That association -- with all the fear, anxiety, guilt, and shame that go along with it -- is still very real for many of us. \n \n As time has gone by, I've seen people become healthier, and I'm continually in awe of those who have survived the epidemic and thrived. Yet new HIV infections continue -- 50,000 annually in the U.S., and over 2 million annually worldwide. Despite all our prevention efforts, I continue to know people who've remained HIV-negative for 20 or 30 years, only to become HIV-positive. I regularly meet young men, some barely out of high school, who have the virus. \n \n None of this is preordained. People don't need to continue to get infected, and we know that PrEP has the potential to help stop the epidemic in its tracks by ending new HIV infections. It's one pill a day, with few side effects for most people. \n \n Condoms remain critically important for HIV-prevention efforts, but they have their limits, as demonstrated by the continuing new infections after 30 years of robust prevention efforts. Only one in six gay men uses condoms consistently and effectively enough to be fully protected from HIV. For those who do use them consistently, condoms offer significant protection but have a failure rate, and condom usage among gay men reduces HIV risk by 76 percent, not 100 percent. \n \n Given the challenges many gay men have with consistent condom use as well as the continued risk of HIV transmission even for those who use condoms, PrEP provides a powerful additional level of protection. It's not a question of either condoms or PrEP. It's about both important tools. \n \n PrEP has broad support in the public-health community. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended its use by those at risk for HIV, including gay men. The state of New York and the San Francisco Department of Public Health have adopted PrEP as a core prevention strategy. The HIV advocacy community overwhelmingly supports PrEP. Most insurance companies cover it fully despite its considerable cost, precisely because it is so effective at preventing a serious illness for which there is no cure. \n \n Some aren't sold on PrEP. Skeptics question whether people will adhere to a daily pill, which is a legitimate concern. Protection decreases if usage is inconsistent. This challenge can be overcome with effective education, and drug adherence is a challenge that isn't unique to PrEP. \n \n Some critics also view PrEP as a license for people to engage in risky behavior and assert that it will cause non-HIV sexually transmitted infections to increase. No study to date has shown that those using PrEP increase risky behavior -- such as reducing condom usage compared with before using PrEP -- and there is evidence to the contrary. Indeed, this line of thinking -- that promoting an effective prevention method will lead to irresponsible behavior -- resembles some of the phony arguments used to attack the HPV vaccine by suggesting that getting vaccinated will lead young girls down a path to promiscuity. And, since PrEP users are regularly screened for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, PrEP use will increase opportunities for prompt detection and treatment of STIs. \n \n PrEP isn't only about gay men. Women can benefit tremendously from it as well. Many women are using PrEP to conceive a child with an HIV-positive partner, a new approach dubbed \"PrEP-ception.\" PrEP can also protect women (and men) in abusive relationships. Too many women -- and gay men as well -- don't fully control how or when they have sex, whether their partners use condoms, and what risks their partners are taking elsewhere. People facing these challenges can take control of their infection risk -- and essentially eliminate that risk -- by using PrEP effectively. \n \n In addition to lack of education and stigma, another significant barrier to fully realizing PrEP's potential benefits is lack of access. PrEP isn't cheap, and for the many people who are uninsured or underinsured, cost can effectively deny access. PrEP needs to be easily available to all communities and all income levels through public healthcare programs, including Medicaid. Otherwise we risk accentuating health disparities among our diverse communities. \n \n Many people and organizations have gotten us where we are with PrEP. The University of California San Francisco is responsible for some of the earliest clinical studies of PrEP, and organizations like San Francisco AIDS Foundation, Project Inform, and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition have been working on the front lines to ensure that the promise of PrEP is fully realized, including advocating for FDA approval, helping establish expanded access programs from the drug manufacturer, ensuring PrEP is covered by insurance plans, and disseminating information to consumers and clinicians. \n \n We know how to end HIV infection. We simply need the political will to ensure that the community has accurate information about and access to all prevention methods, including PrEP. I hope my disclosure can play a role in moving us toward these goals. \n \n Scott Wiener is an elected member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Supervisor Wiener says he's taking HIV-prevention drug 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \n \n San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener on Wednesday became what appears to be the first public figure in the country to disclose that he's taking a drug that prevents HIV infection - a pill that public health officials said could save lives but has remained largely unused due to stigma and lack of awareness. \n \n Wiener's announcement is significant because so few people have been willing to talk openly about their use of Truvada, a drug that's been weighed down by controversy. He said he hopes his revelation will lift some of the stigma associated with Truvada and encourage more men to consider taking it. \n \n Critics have suggested that taking the daily pill could make people more likely to engage in unsafe sex, but that claim hasn't been backed up by research. Still, the idea has persisted, and people have been slow to embrace a drug that public health officials believe could be key to stopping, or significantly slowing down, the spread of HIV. \n \n Wiener's disclosure, which he made in an online essay published Wednesday evening, comes as San Francisco pushes an aggressive campaign to persuade more gay men to take the drug, which is referred to as PrEP, for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Truvada, an antiviral drug that has been used to treat HIV infection for more than a decade, is the only pill approved for prevention. \n \n At a meeting Thursday, Supervisor David Campos is expected to discuss a new initiative to make Truvada more accessible in San Francisco and distribute it to any resident who needs it. The initiative includes a plan to help pay for the drug for residents who can't afford it. Truvada can cost up to $14,000 a year, although it's covered by most insurance plans, and the drugmaker will help with the cost for people who need financial help. \n \n San Francisco city and public health officials said they want to make the drug more accessible, and also normalize it. Wiener said that was his motivation in going public. \n \n 'Elevate awareness' \n \n \"People need to feel comfortable talking about these issues and not think they're going to be stigmatized or denigrated if they talk about using it,\" Wiener said. \"My hope is that talking about it will elevate awareness about PrEP as an available and powerful prevention tool.\" \n \n Truvada, which is made by Gilead Sciences in Foster City, is a single tablet that combines the drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. If taken daily, it can cut the risk of HIV infection by more than 90 percent. \n \n The drug primarily has been tested in men who have sex with men, which is why they're the focus of efforts to increase use of PrEP, although it appears to also be effective for women and transgender men and women. \n \n Most people report no side effects from the drug, and about 10 percent of users say they have some gastrointestinal discomfort for the first few weeks after starting. A smaller percentage of users can suffer more serious signs of drug toxicity and will need to stop taking the drug. \n \n The drug has been widely discussed among health care providers and in the gay community for several years - even before it won FDA approval - but even in San Francisco, where much of the initial research was done, the pill has been slow to gain acceptance. Nationwide, only about 2,000 people are taking PrEP. \n \n \"Nationally, we all - health departments and community groups - need to speed this up, because we could be preventing a lot of infections,\" said Dan Van Gorder, executive director of Project Inform, an HIV patient treatment and information advocacy organization. \n \n The slow acceptance of the drug has been due somewhat to the stigma, which is widespread but has dimmed in recent months. But another major barrier comes from doctors, many of whom have been reluctant to prescribe it, especially if they don't regularly treat HIV-positive patients and aren't familiar with Truvada. \n \n Increase accessibility \n \n That's where San Francisco can improve access to the drug, public health and city officials said. Thursday's city meeting, organized by Campos, is focused on the idea of ensuring the that drug is easily available to anyone who is interested in it, regardless of their ability to afford it or find a doctor who will prescribe it. \n \n \"The issues we face are in getting what we know is a very effective HIV-prevention tool into the hands of people who need it,\" said Dr. Susan Philip, director of the STD Prevention and Control Services Section of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. \"We've always believed in PrEP as an intervention. Now we're figuring out how to help with delivery.\" \n \n Wiener said he was slow to come around to PrEP, even after he'd seen the initial reports about how effective it could be. Like many other men, he wasn't convinced at first that he was the right target for the drug. \n \n \"A lot of us in the past had stereotypes about who should be using PrEP - that PrEP was for sex workers and porn actors and people who hated using condoms. But really prep is much broader than that,\" Wiener said. \n \n Now, he said, he likens the drug to the birth control pill - it's just another option for practicing safe sex. \n \n \"There are some people who are convinced PrEP is going to make people reckless, but that's a bogus argument. It's the same argument we've heard around birth control, and it's very antipublic health,\" Wiener said. \"There's always a lot of judgment around sex. \n \n \"There are downsides to being public about my sexual health,\" Wiener said, adding that the most awkward drawback so far has been telling his mom he was taking PrEP. \"Ultimately, I decided that this could play a positive role in moving the dialogue forward and increasing awareness.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A San Francisco official looks to be the first public figure in the country to \"come out of the PrEP closet,\" as he puts it in a piece for the Huffington Post. Scott Wiener\u2014who represents a district he calls \"ground zero for the HIV epidemic\"\u2014says he takes the daily antiviral pill Truvada to lower his risk of contracting HIV. He's urging other gay men to do the same. \"A much larger segment of gay men should be taking a close look\" at what's known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, Wiener tells the New York Times. Truvada as PrEP has been very slow to catch on across the country, which Wiener writes sees 50,000 new HIV infections each year. Researchers say PrEP could reduce the risk of HIV infection by up to 99% if taken as prescribed. The World Health Organization made a similar case to Wiener's this summer, but the San Francisco Chronicle calls Wiener's announcement \"significant because so few people have been willing to talk openly about their use of Truvada.\" Though the drug's list price is just over $1,000 a month, Wiener says PrEP is covered by most health insurers (he personally pays $15 a month). For the uninsured or those with high-deductible plans, however, the price can be a problem. Wiener's colleague, David Campos, says he will ask the city's health department to develop a strategy that \"addresses the educational and affordability issues\" by December. \"We have to start somewhere,\" says Campos, who adds that every prevented infection saves $355,000 in treatment costs.",

    "document": "Vacant lot at 53 New York Avenue NE in Washington, where a government permit has been granted for work connected with Elon Musk\u2019s Hyperloop project. (Michael Laris/TWP) \n \n It\u2019s not much now, just a parking lot with a discarded gin bottle and an old exterminator receipt. \n \n But the slice of pavement near the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the District could be the gritty precursor to a tunnel network that could propel pods filled with people and speeding platforms topped with Teslas and Toyotas between the nation\u2019s capital and New York in 29 minutes. \n \n Or it could be just be a parking lot littered with dashed transportation dreams. \n \n Electric-car pioneer and space entrepreneur Elon Musk has been touting his vision for a high-speed transportation system since his tweeted announcement last summer that he had received \u201cverbal govt approval\u201d for his tunnel-digging firm, the Boring Company, to build a \u201cNY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop.\u201d \n \n The Boring Company team has received an early, and vague, building permit from the D.C. government that will allow some preparatory and excavation work at the fenced-off parking lot at 53 New York Avenue NE beside a McDonald\u2019s and amid the construction cranes of Washington\u2019s booming NoMa neighborhood. \n \n Asked about the permit, issued Nov. 29, a Boring Company spokesman said Friday that \u201ca New York Avenue location, if constructed, could become a station\u201d in a broad network of such stops across the new system. \n \n D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) visited the Boring Company in California this month, walking in a tunnel to learn more about the technology the company says will make tunneling faster and cheaper. \n \n The District\u2019s Department of Transportation is figuring out what other permits the Boring Company would need to cut under city roads and other public spaces, according to Bowser\u2019s chief of staff, John Falcicchio. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning, in the mayor\u2019s office, our conversation to get an understanding of what the general vision is for Hyperloop,\u201d Falcicchio said. Asked whether the Bowser administration supports the project, he was somewhat upbeat but noncommittal, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re open to the concept of moving people around the region more efficiently.\u201d \n \n Musk has received backing from the White House Office of American Innovation, led by President Trump\u2019s senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose administration rolled out a welcome mat and provided a utility permit, though more permits are needed and no tunneling has begun. Maryland officials say the tunnel would run under Maryland Route 295. The Baltimore-Washington leg would be the initial stretch in the East Coast system. \n \n The overall concept is that pods with perhaps 16 people in each could speed around on electric sleds. Those sleds could also carry individual cars to and from numerous stations. There would be a main artery, with spurs connecting to various stations. \n \n Elevators would take people up and down to the tunnels. And those tunnels would be built relatively close to the surface without disturbing buildings and other structures. \n \n The stations would be somewhat modest affairs, numerous but not grand in scale like Union Station. \n \n \u201cStations in a Loop or Hyperloop system are small in size and widely distributed in a network \u2014 very different from large-station termini considered for train systems,\u201d the company spokesman said. \n \n \u201cHyperloop\u201d refers to a vacuum-based, people- and car-moving system, which would get rid of wind resistance. Shorter hops within or between cities might have a non-vacuum system, hence the reference to a \u201cLoop\u201d system. \n \n Tunnel experts say the digging part is technically feasible, if potentially slow and expensive. As for how to safely orchestrate the underground system of multiple superfast pods, transportation experts say the challenges are legion. \n \n And the naysayers are numerous, though their views are varied. Some point to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising, as with the slow production of his more-affordable Tesla Model 3. But others, even skeptics, say he has a vision and hard-to-beat record of breakthroughs on the road and in his rocket ventures. \n \n Some transportation advocates worry that moving people and cars \u2014 rather than just people \u2014 in the high-speed system would undercut the benefits of more-traditional mass transit. \n \n \u201cWe need to fix the Metro. Traffic is just bad,\u201d said Mohamed Hussein, an Uber driver from Virginia who stopped for lunch beside the New York Avenue parking lot. Hussein was not enamored with the idea of being swept along at harrowing speeds. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bullet. Woooom!\u201d he said. \u201cToo much.\u201d \n \n And he was, he said, realistic about time. \u201cHow long will it take them to build the tunnel?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt will take a long time.\u201d \n \n But Mohamed Musa, director of housekeeping at the Hyatt Place hotel a couple doors down, can\u2019t wait. \n \n \u201cJust the idea of going to New York to have lunch and come back, it\u2019ll be awesome,\u201d Musa said. ||||| First honed as a concept by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk in 2012, hyperloop is touted as the future of passenger transport. \n \n For the uninitiated, hyperloop is a high-speed passenger transport system that involves a sealed tube through which high-speed pods move, slashing travel times. For example, the journey from London to Edinburgh - which takes more than four hours on a train - would theoretically take just 30 minutes. \n \n Musk has since encouraged startup firms and student-led projects to create their own versions of hyperloop. The high-speed system uses a version of magnetic levitation, but what is it and how does it work? \n \n What is magnetic levitation? \n \n Magnetic levitation, or maglev, is when an object is suspended in the air using only magnetic fields and no other support. \n \n Along with super-fast maglev trains, magnetic levitation has various engineering uses including magnetic bearings. It can also be used for display and novelty purposes, such as floating speakers. \n \n How does magnetic levitation work? \n \n Magnetic levitation\u2019s best-known use is in maglev trains. Currently only in operation in a handful of countries, including China and Japan, Maglev trains are the fastest in the world, with a record speed of 375 mph (603 km/h). However, the train systems are incredibly expensive to construct and often end up languishing as little-used vanity projects. \n \n There are two main types of maglev train technology - electromagnetic suspension (EMS) and electrodynamic suspension (EDS). \n \n EMS uses electronically controlled electromagnets in the train to attract it to a magnetic steel track, while EDS uses superconducting electromagnets on both the train and the rail to produce a mutually repellent force that makes the carriages levitate. \n \n A variant of EDS technology - as used in the Inductrack system - uses an array of permanent magnets on the underside of the train, instead of powered electromagnets or cooled superconducting magnets. This is also known as passive magnetic levitation technology. \n \n How does Hyperloop use magnetic levitation? \n \n In Musk\u2019s original concept, the pods floated on a layer of pressurised air, in a similar way to pucks floating on an air hockey table. However, a more recent version of the technology from Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) - one of two companies leading the hyperloop race - uses passive magnetic levitation to achieve the same effect. \n \n The technology has been licensed to HTT from Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL), which developed it as part of the Inductrack system. This method is thought to be cheaper and safer than traditional maglev systems. \n \n With this method, magnets are placed on the underside of the capsules in a Halbach array. This focuses the magnetic force of the magnets on one side of the array while almost entirely cancelling out the field on the other side. These magnetic fields cause the pods to float as they pass over electromagnetic coils embedded in the track. Thrust from linear motors propels the pods forward. \n \n HTT\u2019s main rival, Hyperloop One is also using a passive magnetic levitation system where pod-side permanent magnets repel a passive track, with the only input energy coming from the speed of the pod. \n \n For both systems, air pressure in the tunnels is lowered using air pumps in order to aid the pods\u2019 movement. The low air pressure dramatically reduces drag so that only a relatively small amount of electricity is needed to achieve top speeds. \n \n When will hyperloop launch? \n \n The hyperloop system does appear to be progressing with Hyperloop One recently managing to shoot a passenger pod through a test tube at 192mph (309km/h). But while impressive, it still falls well short of its 250mph (402km/h) goal. \n \n A student team from the Technical University of Munich recently managed to reach an impressive top speed of 201mph (324km/h) on SpaceX\u2019s custom-built 1.5km test track in Hawthorne, California. The extraordinary achievement was part of Elon Musk\u2019s Hyperloop Pod Competition. \n \n The first commercial hyperloop track could be built by Hyperloop One in the UAE, after the company agreed a feasibility study with the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). The proposed system would connect Dubai and Abu Dhabi with a mere 12-minute journey. However, despite various proposed projects around the globe, critics claim that hyperloop infrastructure is far too costly to ever develop into a comprehensive transport system. ||||| A 29-minute trip from D.C. to New York may seem too good to be true. And it very well may be. But that isn\u2019t stopping Elon Musk from pushing forward with plans to build a Hyperloop along the eastern corridor. \n \n And while it\u2019s a very small, very vague step forward, Musk\u2019s Boring Company has received a permit for preparation and preliminary excavation of a site in the nation\u2019s capital. The exact location is 53 New York Avenue NE, next to a McDonald\u2019s and near the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to The Washington Post. \n \n In July, Elon Musk tweeted that he had received verbal government approval to build a multi-state underground Hyperloop on the East Coast. While such approval doesn\u2019t formally exist, Bloomberg confirmed that the White House had had positive conversations with The Boring Company over the proposed tunnel. \n \n Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2017 \n \n This latest permit is far from what\u2019s required to actually begin building the tunnel \u2014 which would run from New York to Philadelphia to Baltimore to D.C. \u2014 but it\u2019s a start. Musk recently received a conditional permit to start operations in Hawthorne, Maryland for a 10.3 mile route. Maryland officials told WaPo that the tunnel would run under Maryland Route 295, with the D.C.-Baltimore leg being built first. \n \n Stations for the Hyperloop would be relatively small and toned down compared to the stations we\u2019re used to, such as Union Station and Penn Station. There would be a main line running between the four aforementioned cities, with smaller lines spurring out from the city\u2019s central station for other potential destinations. \n \n Right now, the trip from NY to D.C. takes more than three hours. It would certainly be nice to pop down for a meeting with just an hour of travel time, but this first permit is comparable to an athlete stretching before a race. We have not yet begun.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Elon Musk's dream of building a hyperloop that can move people between Washington, DC, and New York City in 29 minutes may be a small step closer to becoming a distant reality. A Nov. 29 permit issued by DC's Department of Transportation allows Musk's Boring Company to dig at an abandoned lot beside a McDonald's in northeast Washington that the company says might eventually become a station on a hyperloop connecting NYC, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. The system would speed up travel times, using electricity and electromagnetic levitation to send people and cars whipping through tunnels in pods. But before you ditch your car, the Washington Post points out the permit is only for \"some preparatory and excavation work\" at the site, and more permits are needed before any real construction begins. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has visited a test tunnel Musk is constructing under Los Angeles. But though \"we're open to the concept of moving people around the region more efficiently ... we're just beginning, in the mayor's office, our conversation to get an understanding of what the general vision is for Hyperloop,\" says Bowser's chief of staff, John Falcicchio. Still, the permit \"is comparable to an athlete stretching before a race\" and shows Musk is serious about moving forward with his plans for high-speed travel since claiming \"verbal\" government support for an East Coast hyperloop last July, reports TechCrunch. He's also received a conditional permit to build a tunnel beneath Maryland Route 295 in Hawthorne, per the Post, with Maryland officials saying a leg linking Washington and Baltimore will come first.

Maxine Waters helped investigators get a break in solving a terror plot that targeted senior Democrats and vocal opponents of President Trump, federal officials said. \n \n That clue led investigators on Friday to a white van parked outside an AutoZone shop in Plantation, Fla. The van was plastered with images of Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. It also had pictures of liberal figures in crosshairs. \n \n ... ||||| (CNN) Cesar Sayoc was charged Friday with five federal crimes and faces up to 48 years in prison in connection to improvised explosive devices sent to prominent Democratic politicians, donors and CNN offices in New York. \n \n Sayoc was arrested in a south Florida auto parts store Friday morning as additional explosive devices or suspicious packages were identified in New York and California. \n \n A total of 13 bombs were mailed around the country, FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a new conferences, adding that there could be more packages not yet discovered. \n \n \"These are not hoax devices,\" Wray said. \n \n Sayoc was charged with illegal mailing of explosives, threats against former presidents and others, and assaulting current and former federal officers, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, adding that charges could change or expand as the investigation continues. He initially said Sayoc faced up to 58 years in prison, but the Justice Department later revised that figure to 48. \n \n \"This is a law-and-order administration,\" Sessions said at the Justice Department. \"We will not tolerate such lawlessness, especially not political violence.\" \n \n Speaking at the White House Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump congratulated law enforcement on the arrest and denounced what he called \"terrorizing acts.\" He also called for unity: \"peace and love and harmony as fellow Americans.\" \n \n \"We must never allow political violence to take root in America,\" Trump said at one point. \"I'm committed to doing everything in my power as President to stop it.\" \n \n As the situation initially unfolded mid-morning -- before the arrest was announced -- the President complained on Twitter that the news media was busy reporting on \"'Bomb' stuff\" and not politics. \n \n \"Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this 'Bomb' stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!\" Trump tweeted. \n \n Sessions said a political motive was not immediately known. \n \n Asked why the targets were Democrats or Trump critics, Sessions said, \"I don't know. Other than what you might normally expect. He may have been -- appears to be partisan but that will be determined by the facts as the case goes forward.\" \n \n Sayoc's social media accounts showed he was a fervent supporter of Trump and had posted criticism of CNN and other media outlets. Among the posts were threats to individual political figures and media outlets, including CNN and CNN employees. \n \n Trump told reporters Friday on the South Lawn he had heard Sayoc was a supporter of his, but that didn't mean much to the President. \n \n \"I heard he was a person who prefers me over others, but I did not see that,\" Trump said when asked about images of Trump on Sayoc's van. \n \n The President added, \"There's no blame, there's no anything.\" \n \n Sayoc initially cooperative after arrest \n \n JUST WATCHED Trump praises law enforcement for arrest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump praises law enforcement for arrest 02:08 \n \n FBI agents used flash bangs to arrest Sayoc and took him into custody near an AutoZone store in Plantation, a law enforcement official said. He was initially cooperative and told investigators that the pipe bombs wouldn't have hurt anyone and that he didn't want to harm anyone, the official added. \n \n A white van -- adorned with images of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as a \"CNN Sucks\" sticker -- in Plantation was towed away Friday to Miramar, Florida, where an FBI field office is located. The official said Sayoc had been kicked out by his parents and was living in the van. \n \n He later retained an attorney so police questioning has ceased, the official added. \n \n DNA found on at least one of the packages, as well as Sayoc's cell phone, helped investigators identify him, multiple law enforcement officials said. \n \n Previous arrests \n \n Sayoc was not previously known to the Secret Service, law enforcement sources said, but Florida records show a string of arrests dating back to the early 1990s. \n \n Notable among them is a 2002 arrest by Miami police for an offense described in online records as a \"threat to bomb\" and \"threaten to discharge destructive device.\" A police report at the time shows that he threatened to blow up a power company and that \"it would be worse than September 11th.\" \n \n Cesar Sayoc is shown in this undated photo. \n \n Sayoc pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year of probation, records show. \n \n The records show a total of eight arrests for offenses, including grand theft, battery, fraud and drug possession, as well as multiple probation violations. In 2014, he was arrested after stealing copper pipes at a Home Depot, to which he plead guilty. \n \n The adjudication of each of the arrests could not immediately be determined from the summary of offenses provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Sayoc appears to have pleaded no contest to some offenses. Prosecutors appear to have dropped charges in other matters. \n \n Sayoc also was arrested in North Carolina in 1999 on a stolen vehicle charge, which was later dismissed. \n \n Florida voting records show Sayoc is a registered Republican. He filed for bankruptcy in 2012. \n \n New packages Friday \n \n JUST WATCHED New suspicious packages addressed to Booker, Clapper Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New suspicious packages addressed to Booker, Clapper 02:01 \n \n Earlier Friday, authorities intercepted suspicious packages intended for Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey; former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California; and major Democratic donor Tom Steyer, the latest to be sent to prominent Democrats and critics of Trump that were discovered earlier this week. \n \n Authorities believe the package addressed to Steyer is from Sayoc, according to multiple law enforcement officials. \n \n This brings the total number of known packages sent by Sayoc to 14. However, he's been charged with sending only 13 packages. \n \n One of the officials says the package has been rendered safe and will be transported to the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. \n \n The FBI said Friday that the package addressed to Booker was discovered in Florida and is \"similar in appearance to the others.\" Sources told CNN the package was addressed to the senator's Camden, New Jersey, office. Booker confirmed the package was intended for him but declined to comment further to CNN. The packages intended for Harris and Steyer were discovered in California, law enforcement sources said. \n \n The package intended for Clapper also was addressed to CNN, a law enforcement official said. It was found at a New York City postal facility and was similar to the other packages, the official added. \n \n The Clapper package arrived in a manila envelope with six US flag stamps, just like others discovered this week. The return address is that of Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Florida office, which was the address on packages intended for former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire and Democratic donor George Soros, actor Robert De Niro, former Attorney General Eric Holder, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former CIA Director John Brennan. There is no information that suggests Wasserman Schultz sent them. \n \n Clapper, who has frequently criticized Trump, vowed to CNN Friday morning that he wouldn't be intimidated in light of the discovery. \n \n \"I do want to just echo one thing that John Brennan said and that this is not going to silence the administration's critics,\" Clapper said. \n \n This story is breaking and will be updated. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Nobody was hurt, but the bombs were real, officials said. \n \n \"These are not hoax devices,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said. \n \n Earlier, the suspect's white van, which had pictures of Trump and the presidential seal plastered to the windows, was seized by the officials and hauled off to a secure facility in Plantation, Florida. \n \n In Washington, Trump praised the FBI and Secret Service for the swift arrest. \n \n \"It\u2019s like a needle in a haystack,\" Trump said. \"And they have done an incredible, incredible job.\" \n \n A registered Republican, Sayoc appeared to attend a Trump rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, in 2016. His Facebook page and Twitter accounts contained several postings in support of Trump. \n \n There were also several on his Facebook pages critical of George Soros, the liberal philanthropist who also was targeted with one of the package bombs earlier this week. The account handles were equally ominous \u2014 \u201cKillgeorge Soros\u201d and \u201cKillall Socialist.\u201d \n \n A Facebook spokesperson said Sayoc's page was taken down after it was flagged. \n \n \"In line with our policies, as our community standards explain, we do not allow praise or support for horrendous acts like these,\" the spokesperson said. \"We also do not allow the suspect to maintain a presence on our site, so we\u2019ve removed his account.\" \n \n Altieri said Sayoc was born in Brooklyn but moved to Florida as a child and grew up in North Miami Beach. \n \n Sayoc has a criminal record in Florida and was arrested in 2002 for making a bomb threat, according to Miami-Dade County court records. He pleaded guilty. There were also two arrests, one in 1992 and the other in 2014, for petit theft. \n \n In the later theft case, Sayoc tried to walk out of a Walmart with a shopping cart filled with $239 worth of merchandise, according to an arrest affidavit. \n \n In 2015, Sayoc was convicted of stealing a heavy rolling briefcase and a garment bag from Walmart worth $58. \n \n Sayoc also had a misdemeanor arrest on his record in North Carolina, where he was charged in 1999 for possession of stolen car, records show. And in 1995, he was charged in Minnesota with theft and possession of crack cocaine. \n \n In May 2015, Sayoc also said that he was the victim of a robbery, according to a Broward County Sheriff\u2019s report obtained by NBC News. The report says that 11 items of clothing worth roughly $7,000 were taken from Sayoc. \n \n Listed under the \u201cmake\u201d section of the report, describing the nature of the clothing, was the president\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d \n \n The 2002 mug shot of Cesar Sayoc when he made a bomb threat in Miami.

At the time, he was living with his mother and employed as a grocery store manager, records show. \n \n But of late, Sayoc had been living in his van and showering at the gym where he works out, a Florida-based cousin told NBC News. \n \n Sayoc played soccer for one semester at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 1983. \"He was a good kid and a hard worker,\" former teammate Philip Drosdick said. \n \n But Drosdick said their relationship took a bizarre turn after he left UNCC for the University of Central Florida and Sayoc followed. He said Sayoc suspected he had stolen his favorite jacket and took revenge by sneaking into his room, grabbing one shoe of every pair he had as well as his mattress, several jackets and pants, and his $350 surfboard. \n \n Drosdick said he found most of his stuff in a shed. \"I've not seen Cesar or my surfboard since then, \" he said. \n \n Records show that Sayoc also lived for a time in New Jersey, Michigan and Brooklyn, New York. \n \n On Facebook, Sayoc also claimed to be a booking agent with the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. A spokesperson for the tribe told NBC News that Sayoc was not a member and had never been employed at the casino. \n \n It was not immediately clear if Sayoc has Native American ancestry. But he named the two businesses he operated for a time Native American Catering & Vending and Proud Native America One Low Price Drycleaning, according to Florida business records. \n \n On his LinkedIn page, Sayoc listed himself as Cesar Altieri and claimed to have worked for Chippendales.

(Associated Press) \n \n New York City police officers clear the scene after a report of a possible suspicious package was called in at the Time Warner Center Thursday, Oct. 25, 2018, in New York. The NYPD had said it had evaluated the packages \"as a precaution\" on Thursday night. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal authorities took a man into custody Friday in Florida in connection with the mail-bomb scare that earlier widened to 12 suspicious packages, the FBI and Justice Department said. \n \n The man was identified by law enforcement officials as Cesar Sayoc, 56, of Aventura, Florida. He was arrested at an auto parts store in the nearby city of Plantation. \n \n Court records show Sayoc has a history of arrests. \n \n Law enforcement officers were seen on television examining a white van, its windows covered with an assortment of stickers, in the city of Plantation in the Miami area. Authorities covered the vehicle with a blue tarp and took it away on the back of a flatbed truck. \n \n The stickers included images of American flags and what appeared to be logos of the Republican National Committee and CNN, though the writing surrounding those images was unclear. \n \n President Donald Trump said he expected to speak about the investigation at a youth summit on Friday. \n \n The development came amid a coast-to-coast manhunt for the person responsible for a series of explosive devices addressed to Democrats including former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. \n \n Law enforcement officials said they had intercepted a dozen packages in states across the country. None had exploded, and it wasn't immediately clear if they were intended to cause physical harm or simply sow fear and anxiety. \n \n Earlier Friday, authorities said suspicious packages addressed to New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former National Intelligence Director James Clapper \u2014 both similar to those containing pipe bombs sent to other prominent critics of President Donald Trump\u2014 had been intercepted. \n \n Investigators believe the mailings were staggered. The U.S. Postal Service searched their facilities 48 hours ago and the most recent packages didn't turn up. Officials don't think they were sitting in the system without being spotted. They were working to determine for sure. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. \n \n The FBI said the package to Booker was intercepted in Florida. The one discovered at a Manhattan postal facility was addressed to Clapper at CNN's address. An earlier package had been sent to former Obama CIA Director John Brennan via CNN in New York. \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday the Justice Department was dedicating every available resource to the investigation \"and I can tell you this: We will find the person or persons responsible. We will bring them to justice.\" \n \n Trump, on the other hand, complained that \"this 'bomb' stuff\" was taking attention away from the upcoming election and said critics were wrongly blaming him and his heated rhetoric. \n \n Investigators were analyzing the innards of the crude devices to reveal whether they were intended to detonate or simply sow fear just before Election Day. \n \n Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that the devices, containing timers and batteries, were not rigged to explode upon opening. But they were uncertain whether the devices were poorly designed or never intended to cause physical harm. \n \n Most of those targeted were past or present U.S. officials, but one was sent to actor Robert De Niro and billionaire George Soros. The bombs have been sent across the country - from New York, Delaware and Washington, D.C., to Florida and California, where Rep. Maxine Waters was targeted. They bore the return address of Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. \n \n The common thread among the bomb targets was obvious: their critical words for Trump and his frequent, harsher criticism in return. \n \n Trump claimed Friday he was being blamed for the mail bombs, complaining in a tweet sent before dawn: \"Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, 'it's just not Presidential!'\" \n \n The package to Clapper was addressed to him at CNN's Midtown Manhattan address. Clapper, a frequent Trump critic, told CNN that he was not surprised he was targeted and that he considered the actions \"definitely domestic terrorism.\" \n \n Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN Worldwide, said in a note to staff that all mail to CNN domestic offices was being screened at off-site facilities. He said there was no imminent danger to the Time Warner Center, where CNN's New York office is located. \n \n At a press conference Thursday, officials in New York would not discuss possible motives or details on how the packages found their way into the postal system. Nor would they say why the packages hadn't detonated, but they stressed they were still treating them as \"live devices.\" \n \n The devices were packaged in manila envelopes and carried U.S. postage stamps. They were being examined by technicians at the FBI's forensic lab in Quantico, Virginia. \n \n The packages stoked nationwide tensions ahead of the Nov. 6 election to determine control of Congress \u2014 a campaign both major political parties have described in near-apocalyptic terms. Politicians from both parties used the threats to decry a toxic political climate and lay blame. \n \n Trump, in a tweet Thursday, blamed the \"Mainstream Media\" for the anger in society.

    "document": "The T. rex's roar has struck fear into audiences from the days of King Kong to Jurassic World, but new research found that dinosaurs probably didn't sound anything like that. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \n \n Picture, if you will, the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex. \n \n The odds are good what you envision has been brought to you in part by \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d a plastic toy or some other facet of pop culture. (Perhaps you\u2019re a fan of stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen.) But what Hollywood won\u2019t teach you is that T. rex may have had feathers. \n \n After all, today\u2019s birds are living dinosaurs. \n \n Now listen closely to your fearsome and possibly feathered friend. If you imagine it roaring, as both Steven Spielberg and \u201cThe Valley of Gwangi\u201d did, we are sorry to say that sound is complete fiction. The roar of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d\u2018s CGI tyrannosaur can be traced to a sound studio rather than the fossil record. It was a witches\u2019 brew of baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs and a gargling alligator, remixed into a cinematically terrifying but completely artificial aural blast. \n \n Were a dinosaur to vocalize in defense of its territory \u2014 or as a mating call \u2014 it might have sounded like one of today\u2019s birds, scientists say. In fact, a journal article published online Monday argues that the ancient reptiles made sounds closer to the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. Those are far cries from mammalian screams. \n \n [Grooves in the ground may reveal a bird-like dinosaur mating dance] \n \n According to the new research, dino sounds may be what scientists call \u201cclosed-mouth vocalizations.\u201d Unlike the high-pitched chirps and tweets from the open beaks of songbirds, the closed-mouth sounds are low, throaty whooshes of air. A flesh sac called an esophageal pouch enables birds with proportionally large bodies \u2014 think pigeons or doves \u2014 to produce the low murmurs. \n \n A cooing dove with its mouth closed. (Tobias Riede/Midwestern University) \n \n The researchers figured out the common bird sound like this: First, they collected vocal data on all sorts of animals called archosaurs, which include birds and crocodiles. And, notably, the long-dead dinosaurs. Writing in the journal Evolution, scientists from universities in Texas, Arizona, Utah and Canada analyzed the noises made by many living bird and crocodilian species. \n \n They divided the types of sounds into various groups, including the close-mouth noises. Roughly a quarter of 200 birds species analyzed emitted the bulging closed-mouth sounds. Small birds, like sparrows and finches, did not make the noise. But birds with proportionally larger body types \u2014 like doves, ostriches and the giant New Zealand cassowary \u2014 do. This, the researchers say, suggest large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities. \n \n \u201cLooking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalized,\u201d said study author and University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason in a statement. \n \n [These chickens now have dinosaur legs \u2014 but that\u2019s not as weird as you might think] \n \n Moreover, because not all birds had the trait, the scientists say it evolved separately in different groups of animals. It appeared in 16 distinct animal lineages, including crocodiles and birds. The scientists feel confident it could have evolved in dinosaurs, too. \n \n \n \n A model dinosaur at the recent International Tokyo Toy show. (Kazuhiro Nogikazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n \u201cA cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,\u201d Tobias Riede, Midwestern University physiology expert and lead author of the paper, said in a news release. \u201cThat suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays.\u201d \n \n The researchers were handicapped in their study because vocal organs, made of soft tissue, do not fossilize the way dinosaur bones do. So it\u2019s much easier to build a big scary creature than to reconstruct what it sounded like. \n \n But there are a few other hints in addition to this study. Based on what scientists know about birds, dinosaurs likely did not have vocal cords \u2014 those tough membranes that vibrate when a lion roars or a human speaks. Instead, they had air sacs, and it is possible dinosaurs had a birdlike syrinx, too (an organ similar to our larynxes but two-pronged and lower in the chest). \n \n [How to find the dinosaurs that hide inside modern birds] \n \n If a non-avian dinosaur whooshed like a bird, with its throat puffed up, the scientists suggest it may have sounded like the most intimidating large-bodied birds of today: ostriches and cassowaries. \n \n Though ostriches are imposing creatures, their hoots leave Hollywood-trained ears wanting. The ostrich mating call is a low buzz, a sound about as ferocious as the gasps from a dying vacuum cleaner. \n \n That said, the sound-smiths behind \u201cJurassic Park\u201d were able to call on the dinosaurs\u2019 living cousins in a few tense scenes \u2014 just not for T. rex. \n \n As designer Gary Rydstrom told Vulture in 2013, the sibilant velociraptors \u2014 specifically, the sounds emitted right before a certain clever raptor ambushes game warden Robert Muldoon \u2014 have avian influences. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s a goose,\u201d Rydstrom said to Vulture. \u201cBirds make pretty raspy sounds, but geese are famous for being the nastiest. You\u2019ve got to get a goose mad and then they hiss at you, and it doesn\u2019t take much to get a goose mad because they seem to get mad at everything.\u201d \n \n [The most outlandish theory yet for what killed off the dinosaurs] \n \n For creatures that so readily capture both popular imagination and scientific study, much remains unknown about dinosaurs. \n \n The vast majority of dinosaur species have yet to be found, argued University of Pennsylvania researchers in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe bet that a child born today could expect a very fruitful career in dinosaur paleontology,\u201d said paleontologist Peter Dodson at the time, after he and his co-author estimated that humans had discovered only 29 percent of dinosaur genera \u2014 the taxonomic rank made of a bundle of many species. \n \n Dino sounds are no exception to the mystery. It is safe to say dinosaurs made sounds, as American Museum of Natural History Mark Norell put it. But exact specifics \u2014 like certainty of dino whooshes, hoots or coos \u2014 died with the animals, 65 million years ago. ||||| This post originally ran in April 2013. We are rerunning it with Jurassic World\u00c2 opening this weekend. \n \n \"If people knew where the sounds in Jurassic Park came from, it'd be rated R!\" laughed Gary Rydstrom. The sound designer rang me up last week to discuss his work on the Steven Spielberg action classic, newly rereleased in 3-D; when the movie came out in 1993, it netted him two Academy Awards for sound design and mixing (he's been nominated an astonishing 17 times over his career, winning seven statuettes). Though the Jurassic job was fun, Rydstrom remembers it as a tall order: He had to create dozens of distinct dinosaur noises essentially from scratch, since no one really knows what these long-dead animals would have sounded like. His solution was to spend months recording animal noises \u2014 some exotic, some not \u2014 then tweaking those homegrown sounds to create something otherworldly but still organic. What recognizable animals did he use to mix together the raptor, the T. rex, and all of Jurassic Park's other dinosaurs? Read on, if you dare: As Rydstrom implied, some of the sounds are sorta smutty. \n \n Velociraptors \n \n The intelligent raptors appear to have their own simple language, and it turns out that it's the language of love. \"It's somewhat embarrassing, but when the raptors bark at each other to communicate, it's a tortoise having sex,\" said Rydstrom. \"It's a mating tortoise! I recorded that at Marine World \u2026 the people there said, 'Would you like to record these two tortoises that are mating?' It sounded like a joke, because tortoises mating can take a long time. You've got to have plenty of time to sit around and watch and record them.\" \n \n Still, that wasn't the only animal element used to create the raptor noises. \"When the raptor shows up in the door window in the kitchen, the breathing noise is a horse,\" said Rydstrom. \"We used the horse in about three to four different dinosaurs.\" What about the hiss that raptor makes when it ambushes the game warden Muldoon (which prompts him to mutter, \"Clever girl\")? \"That\u2019s a goose. Birds make pretty raspy sounds, but geese are famous for being the nastiest. You\u2019ve got to get a goose mad and then they hiss at you, and it doesn't take much to get a goose mad because they seem to get mad at everything. All you have to do is get close to one and stick a mic near its beak and you'll get that hiss, and that's the hiss that Muldoon hears before he dies.\" \n \n Gallimimus \n \n If the Gallimimus flock recalls a stampede of wild horses, there's good reason for it. \"I remember recording a female horse, and the male horse came right by her and she squealed because she was in heat,\" laughed Rydstrom. \"A lot of animals in heat make a very unique sound, and she squealed at this male because he got a little too close and she was excited about the male, I assume. And that\u2019s the squeal the Gallimimuses make when they\u2019re passing by, and the squeal one makes when it's getting eaten by a T. rex. One of the key elements of the raptor screams was a boy dolphin in heat, so you can see a pattern here!\" \n \n Tyrannosaurus rex \n \n The fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex is one of the biggest animals in Jurassic Park, but some of its key noises came from Rydstrom's tiny Jack Russell terrier, Buster. \"The way they animated the T. rex was very doglike, especially when it grabs the Gallimimus and the lawyer and shakes them to death,\" said Rydstrom. \"Every day I would see my dog playing with the rope toy and doing exactly that, pretending like he's killing his prey.\" Was Buster's Jurassic Park cameo an isolated incident? \"No, I use my pets all the time,\" laughed Rydstrom. \"In Terminator 2, I recorded the sound of Buster eating puppy chow, and that became the crunch when the T-1000 spiked that guy\u2019s eye socket.\" \n \n \"One of the fun things in sound design is to take a sound and slow it down: It becomes much bigger,\" he continued. \"That was inspired by Ben Burtt, the great sound designer from the Star Wars movies and a mentor of mine: He did the Rancor beast in Return of the Jedi by slowing a chihuahua sound down. It's one of the secrets of sound design that if you slow something down, something small, it brings out elements of the sound that you could probably never get if you recorded something big.\" \n \n As for that bone-shivering, theater-shaking T. rex roar: \"The key element of the T. rex roar is not a full-grown elephant but a baby elephant,\" said Rydstrom. \"So once again, a small animal making a small sound slowed down a little bit has more interest to us than what a big animal might do.\" \n \n Brachiosaurus \n \n \"The brachiosaur\u2019s singing is one of my favorite sounds in the movie because it\u2019s beautiful, but like all good sound design, it's made from a non-beautiful source, which is donkeys,\" said Rydstrom. \"You think of donkeys, and they kind of yodel, you know? There's this pitch shift in donkey vocals, and if you slow them way down, you get almost a hooting, songlike quality. That's the brachiosaur when it\u2019s in its splendor mode.\" And what about later in the movie, when it's in its sneezing mode? \"That's a whale blowhole and a fire hydrant.\" \n \n Triceratops \n \n \"I work at Skywalker Ranch, which has a lot of cattle around, so I used a lot of cows for the triceratops,\" said Rydstrom. \"But the main sound of the sick triceratops is its breathing \u2014 this long, slow inhale and exhale \u2014 and that's actually one of the only elements of the movie that isn't an organic sound. I used this long cardboard tube with a spring in it, a reverb device that makes sounds seem stretched out and deeper and weird. So when Sam Neill puts his ear right up to the chest cavity of the triceratops and listens to its breathing, there's a lot of cow in there, but the key element of the breathing is mostly me breathing into a tube.\" \n \n Rydstrom admitted that he did sneak one other human voice into the movie: his friend Dietrich. \"He was visiting me and I turned on the mic and said, 'Can you make any weird sounds?' And he did this phlegmy, guttural growl. In the kitchen attack scene, there\u2019s a close-up of the raptor slowly opening its mouth when it's about to attack Lex as she's hiding in a cabinet, and that sound is mostly my friend Dietrich doing this weird guttural growl. At the time, it felt like cheating when I would use myself or any other human to make a dinosaur sound \u2014 I felt like I was cheating the sound-design gods!\" \n \n Baby Raptor \n \n The sounds Rydstrom used to animate the newly hatched dinosaur are just as adorable as the creature itself. \"It's just been born, so at first it\u2019s really squeaky and cute, and we recorded a lot of baby animals: baby owls, baby foxes, and things like that,\" he said. And no, your ears aren't deceiving you: When Sam Neill finds out that the cute baby dino is actually a vicious velociraptor, the sounds it emits become more \u2026 unsettling. \"That's exactly right; as soon as he asks, 'What kind of dinosaur is this?' you start hearing these raspier baby owl sounds,\" said Rydstrom. \"I already knew what the adult raptor would sound like, that it would have this screechy, raspy sound, so I tried to find a baby animal that has that rasp in it.\" \n \n Dilophosaurus \n \n When we first meet the Dilophosaurus, it cocks its head at Dennis Nedry and lets out an appealing trill. \"Made from a swan,\" revealed Rydstrom. \"Swans make a cute hooting sound, so the cute version of the Dilophosaurus sounds like a swan, for the most part.\" He chuckled. \"Part of the fun of doing these kind of jobs is that I had no idea what a swan sounded like before!\" \n \n Of course, things quickly escalate with the Dilophosaurus as it grows a fearsome cowl and expectorates all over its prey. \"When it's the scary spitter, there\u2019s definitely a rattlesnake sound in there as it fans out its canopy around its head, and the raspy sounds in its voice are from a hawk,\" said Rydstrom, adding with a laugh, \"Whenever I give lectures to people about getting sounds for movies, one of the key things I tell them is that when you\u2019re recording dangerous animals like lions and alligators and rattlesnakes, then you have your assistant do it! On Jurassic Park, I had an assistant, the lovely Chris Boyd \u2014 who's still alive \u2014 and if we needed a rattlesnake, I\u2019d say, 'Chris, please record the rattlesnake.' And I\u2019d record the dogs and the kittens!\" ||||| This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Closed\u2010mouth vocalizations generate resonance conditions that favor low\u2010frequency sounds. By contrast, open\u2010mouth vocalizations cover a wider frequency range. Here we describe closed\u2010mouth vocalizations of birds from functional and morphological perspectives and assess the distribution of closed\u2010mouth vocalizations in birds and related outgroups. Ancestral\u2010state optimizations of body size and vocal behavior indicate that closed\u2010mouth vocalizations are unlikely to be ancestral in birds and have evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves, predominantly in large\u2010bodied lineages. Closed\u2010mouth vocalizations are rare in the small\u2010bodied passerines. In light of these results and body size trends in nonavian dinosaurs, we suggest that the capacity for closed\u2010mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. As in birds, this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and hence would have co\u2010occurred with open\u2010mouthed vocalizations. ||||| Colors show probability of each branch being an open-mouth vocalizer (blue) or a closed-mouth vocalizer (red). Pies show the probabilities that the ancestors of birds and crocodiles, palaeognath birds, and neognath birds used closed-mouth vocalization. Tobias Riede \n \n AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Dinosaurs are often depicted in movies as roaring ferociously, but it is likely that some dinosaurs mumbled or cooed with closed mouths, according to a study posted online in the journal Evolution that will be published in the August print issue. \n \n The research examines the evolution of a specialized way birds emit sound \u2014 closed-mouth vocalization. The study emerges from a new collaboration, funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the large array of sounds it can produce. Because birds descended from dinosaurs, the research may also shed light on how dinosaurs made sound. \n \n \n \n X-ray image of a ring dove (Streptopelia risoria) producing cooing sounds with a closed mouth. Tobias Riede \n \n Closed-mouth vocalizations are sounds that are emitted through the skin in the neck area while the beak is kept closed. To make them, birds typically push air that drives sound production into an esophageal pouch rather than exhale through the open beak. The coos of doves are an example of this behavior. Compared with sounds emitted through an open beak, closed-mouth vocalizations are often much quieter and lower in pitch. Birds making closed-mouth vocalizations usually do so only to attract mates or defend their territory. At other times, they emit sounds through an open mouth. \n \n To understand when and how closed-mouth vocalization evolved, researchers with The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of Utah used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and other reptilian groups. In total, the researchers identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization. \n \n \u201cLooking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalized,\u201d said Chad Eliason, a postdoctoral researcher at The University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences and the study\u2019s co-author. \u201cOur results show that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs and crocodiles. Interestingly, only animals with a relatively large body size (about the size of a dove or larger) use closed-mouth vocalization behavior.\u201d \n \n Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University and the study\u2019s first author, said the association with large bodies is a matter of physics. \n \n \u201cThe inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge,\u201d Riede said. \u201cThe lung pressure required to inflate a cavity depends on the tension in the wall of the cavity, and this tension increases for smaller body sizes.\u201d \n \n Researchers still are not certain about how the ancestors of modern archosaurs vocalized.

    "document": "TRENTON \u2014 The Republican field for the White House is growing larger by the day, and that could be a problem for Gov. Chris Christie. \n \n With former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush jumping in last week, the formally declared Republican candidates for the White House stands at a dozen, including five former or current U.S. Senators and four current or former governors. There hasn't been a presidential field approaching this size since 1860, when Abraham Lincoln was elected. \n \n Christie, who is expected to add his name to the big list in the coming weeks, is already part of a mad scramble of Republicans trying to win national attention and gain the favor of GOP voters responding to presidential polls. That's because Fox News Channel has decided that only the top 10 GOP candidates in the polls will be allowed into its televised Aug. 6 debate (CNN has the same rule for its mid-September debate, although it will hold another one for also-rans in the polls). \n \n Christie's well-known rhetorical skills would be on full display in such a forum \u2013 but only if he makes the cut. Earlier this month, a Washington Post/ABC News poll illustrated just how slender the difference is between first and last in the crowded field: Only five percentage points divide Christie, in eighth place, from the first place candidates U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. And he was just four percentage points from 12th place. \n \n \"You're already seeing the party struggling with who gets invited (to the debate) and who doesn't,\" said Thomas F. Schaller, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the author of the new book \"The Stronghold: How the How Republicans Captured Congress but Surrendered the White House.\" \n \n Schaller said that to gain traction in the media and improve poll numbers, Christie and his rivals will likely start playing nastier faster than ever. \n \n \"The things that break though are the really big stories and really big gaffes,\" he said, \"which really puts a premium on earned media and being really critical. ... Big attacks draw media attention.\" \n \n Christie, who specializes in full-contact politics, is already employing a plan of attack. \n \n On Friday, he once again took aim at 2016 contender Paul for recently leading the effort to let parts of the Patriot Act, which allowed U.S. officials to collect Americans' phone data, expire. \n \n \"What Paul has done has made us weaker and more vulnerable,\" Christie told an audience in Philadelphia. \"It's disgraceful. It's made our country a more dangerous place.\" \n \n On Thursday at an ersatz campaign stop in New Hampshire, Christie chided Bush for being \"late to the party\" with his newly announced economic plan aiming for 4 percent economic growth. \n \n \"This is one of these areas where I'm really flattered that Jeb Bush is copying me because I spoke three, four weeks ago in New Hampshire about a five-step plan to get to four percent growth,\" Christie said. \"Then I heard Jeb announce on Monday that he's for four percent growth too \u2014 that's good. I welcome him to the party. He's a little bit late, but I welcome him.\" \n \n The size of the field and its closely competitive rankings means a different approach to early campaigning is needed, experts say. \n \n \"As we move into the phase of the campaign where they are debating, the candidates who are shaping the discussion are going to get more (media) attention,\" said Steve Schmidt, who ran the day-to-day operations of Sen. John McCain's 2008 White House bid, \"And so, at a personal level, candidates need to stake out territory, because it's the meat on the bones of why are you running: Do you just want the big house, plane and helicopter, or do you want to get something done for the country?\" \n \n Christie has followed this roadmap as well, proposing detailed plans for reforms to federal entitlement programs, immigration policy, taxes and education. In a normal race, offering up such specificity early on might cost a candidate some voters, but in such an unusually large field, Schmidt says Christie has a clear advantage by defining his positions. \n \n \"There's a tendency sometimes among candidates to take what I call a 'preventative defense' that's organized around the principle of not making mistakes or not putting information out there,\" Schmidt said. \"I think it's not a winning strategy. As a candidate, you need to be an 'advocate for' and not a 'hedger against.' He's doing that, and he's also indicating a style of leadership which he'll articulate in the White House: 'I'm not going to be afraid to take on the tough problems, and I'm going to talk truthfully.'\" \n \n Getting enough attention to make the cut for the GOP debates could be complicated by the summer months, when TV audiences are about 10 percent less than in the winter months, according to Dounia Turrill, a senior vice-president at Nielsen, the TV ratings company. \n \n And the large field of candidates makes it even tougher, experts say. \n \n \"Historically, we've never had so many people who are seriously running for the presidency and who have become part of the daily news cycle,\" said Joseph Ellis, author of the Pulitzer prize-winning presidential history, \"Founding Brothers.\" \n \n Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said as a result, \"We're going to see more of them and less of them at the same time. There'll be more debates but at the same time, in terms of the major media outlets, each one will have less time and space to be heard.\" \n \n In first primary state New Hampshire, where Christie has spent much of his late spring, lifelong Republican Leonore Moniz, 82, of Manchester, articulated a refrain common to scores of GOP voters interviewed by NJ Advance Media in the Granite State in recent weeks: \"There's too many of them.\" \n \n Finding a way to the front of the pack as soon as possible is especially important because top GOP strategists and presidential historians agree that the 2016 campaign could last longer than any in recent memory. \n \n Thanks to the 2012 Citizens United U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which allows unlimited amounts of cash to back presidential candidates, much of the field may stay in the race far longer than usual if hopefuls can find even a single billionaire to champion them. \n \n \"There's an excellent chance this all goes to May or June of next year,\" said Ellis. \n \n If that happens, it could put in play a state that rarely has a say in presidential primaries: New Jersey, which holds its primary June 7 next year. \n \n Richard Davis, who served as the campaign manager for Sen. John McCain's 2008 White House bid, said it could last even longer than that. \n \n \n \n \"The combination of big outside money, a condensed primary timetable and 15 candidates will result in a prolonged nominating process and could result in a brokered convention since no candidate will get to the 1,100 delegates needed,\" said Davis. \n \n \"In 2008, McCain wrapped up the nomination by March. In 2012 it took Romney to May. In 2016 it will go to the convention in July. Not only are there a lot more candidates but with the outside money widely distributed there is no incentive to winnow the field,\" he said. \n \n Claude Brodesser-Akner may be reached at cbrodesser@njadvancemedia.com.

Plunging into the hand-to-hand campaigning that First Staters relish, he\u2019ll hold at least three town halls and attend a Fourth of July celebration, plus various house and diner stops. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Offering himself as a pragmatic, results-oriented conservative, Christie will signal his willingness to take on tough issues that others duck, notably entitlements. Another key part of Christie\u2019s message will be his ability to win and govern in a blue state, where he did well in his reelection race with women, Hispanics and even Democrats. \n \n A top adviser said the announcement tour is meant to showcase a Christie strength: \u201cCommunicating to bring people to his side \u2014 even people who don\u2019t agree on every issue.\u201d \n \n Christie\u2019s wife, Mary Pat, and the rest of his family, along with longtime supporters and friends, will jam the gym at Livingston High School, where he was president for three years, for the 11 a.m. bash. The invocation will be by Joe Carter, pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, who has been a key voice for Christie in the African-American community. \n \n The adviser said the audience \u201cwill see a lot of who he is as a person,\u201d including the middle-class upbringing that shaped him: the influence of his late mother, his Irish father working at the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark to put himself through Rutgers, a grandmother who was a Sicilian immigrant and a single mother. \n \n A preview video shows Christie at a town hall, saying that his loud candor has its roots in his loving, trusting family. \n \n The adviser said Christie welcomes the discussion about the bridge closing and subsequent investigation at this point. \n \n \u201cTo get past it, there has to be a little discussion,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cPeople can see now that everything he said was true. That doesn\u2019t mean that the damage is undone. But people and donors are moving past it for the first time. For the most part, people will be looking to the future, not the past.\u201d \n \n After the announcement speech, Christie will fly to New Hampshire for a 6 p.m. Tuesday town hall in Sandown. On Wednesday, he has an endorsement announcement at Mary Ann\u2019s Diner in Derry, then an afternoon house party in Bridgewater, followed by a town hall at the American Legion hall in Ashland, in Grafton County. \n \n On Thursday, he has a town hall in Rochester, and he stops by the Pink Cadillac Diner. Then it\u2019s on to a luncheon in Portsmouth, followed by an endorsement announcement and a house party. He\u2019ll remain in New Hampshire on Friday, with events to be announced, and on Saturday will celebrate the Fourth of July with his new best friends in the Granite State. \n \n Mike DuHaime, Christie\u2019s longtime strategist, will advise the campaign from the outside. Close adviser Maria Comella has moved to his PAC. Samantha Smith, the PAC\u2019s communications director, and James Garcia, the PAC\u2019s political director, are expected to play similar roles from the campaign, which will be based in northern New Jersey. \n \n Subscribe to Playbook here. \n \n Follow @politico \n \n Authors:",

He asserts there may be a new political wave coming, but no one knows whether it will be a red or blue wave. \n \n As I listened to the end of the year \"analysts,\" I was struck by how little they know, how little they have questioned their own mistakes, and how mutually reinforcing their false information has been. \n \n Adams, the author of Dilbert, has a list of 20 political opinions and predictions made about President Trump and his Administration, which were just plain wrong. He suggests if you were wrong about 15 or more of these assertions, you might quit talking about politics while Trump is in the White House. By Adams\u2019s standard, most elite \"analysts\" would have to be quiet, because they have been so consistently wrong about Trump. \n \n As I listened to the end of the year \"analysts,\" I was struck by how little they know, how little they have questioned their own mistakes, and how mutually reinforcing their false information has been. \n \n These are not analysts. These are liberal propagandists. Much of what they assert is just plain wrong. Fake news is, sadly, an accurate term. And the topic about which they have been the most fake is the GOP\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n \n First, the media lied about the tax bill in an effort to convince most Americans their taxes would go up. \n \n Then, the media took surveys of people who opposed the GOP bill based on the false information supplied by the media. \n \n Then, the media talked again and again about how unpopular the Republican plan was and how it was going to weaken Republican candidates in 2018. \n \n Then, the bill passed, and unsurprisingly, it turned out to be dramatically better for Americans than the elite media had described. \n \n In fact, the tax cuts will be the 2018 proving ground of media liberal bias and dishonesty. \n \n CBS News just provided a vivid example of the false impressions created by the liberal news media\u2019s lies. They interviewed three families about how they expected the GOP tax bill to affect them. Then they had a CPA tell them, on camera, what they would actually be paying in taxes next year. \n \n Of course, after months of convincing most Americans their taxes would go up, the three families either expected to be paying more in taxes or to not save any money. And you can tell by watching the segment that the liberal hosts expected the same. \n \n Of course, it turned out that all three families would pay less under the GOP tax cuts than under current law. \n \n A North Carolina single mother with an income slightly under $40,000 who didn\u2019t think she would be affected will keep about $1,300 more per year under the GOP bill. \n \n Two college teachers in Rhode Island with a joint income of over $150,000 a year thought they would pay more taxes, but they will actually pay about $650 less under the GOP tax cut. \n \n The biggest surprise in the CBS report was the impact the tax cuts would have on a California couple with three children, a small business, and earning an income of approximately $300,000. The family believed that because California is a high-tax state, that capping state and local tax deductions would really hurt them. Instead, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will save them nearly $13,000 in taxes. \n \n The look on the three families faces as they learned how much they would be saving was remarkable to behold. \n \n The CBS analyst concluded \"every one of the families will have more money in their pocket next year.\" \n \n As my colleague Joe Desantis wrote me: \"This segment drove me crazy. As if CBS was incapable of doing math before the tax cuts passed.\" \n \n The gap between the news media falsehoods and the dramatically better reality of the GOP tax cuts will have three huge effects on the 2018 campaign: \n \n 1. The American people will be positively surprised and pleased by the degree to which Republicans kept their word and actually put more money in taxpayer pockets. After 10 months of frustration from trying to repeal Obamacare, Republicans have proven they can get big things done. \n \n \n \n 2. The news media\u2019s dishonesty will be vivid at a personal level. People will be able to compare their personal experience with the news media's fake reporting and endless bias. As the truth sinks in, the ability of the liberal media to shape opinion will decline even further. \n \n \n \n 3. Democrats who voted against the bill will live to regret it as people look at their family budgets and realize Democrats in the House and Senate wanted Washington bureaucrats to have more money, rather than hard-working Americans. This will certainly be a losing proposition for the 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in states President Trump won in 2016. \n \n In fact, the stage is being set for a definitive election. \n \n Do you want higher taxes, bigger bureaucracy, more power in Washington, and a smaller economy with lower take-home pay and fewer jobs? If yes, vote Democrat, because that is what they stand for and will continue to vote for next year. \n \n If you want a bigger economy, more jobs, more take-home pay, less power with Washington bureaucrats, and lower taxes with more money in your pocket, then vote Republican. \n \n If Republicans can learn to tell the truth better than the elite media and Democrats lie, the GOP will win an astonishing victory in 2018. ||||| When candidate Trump first set about the job of redefining politics (and reality) back in 2015, people had lots of predictions about how things would turn out. One year isn\u2019t long enough to know everything we need to know about his presidency, but it\u2019s long enough to to check some of our predictions. As a public service, I put together a list of predictions that various people made about Trump that you can use to evaluate your own predictive powers. Count the number of items on the list that you once predicted would be true. I\u2019ll tell you how to evaluate your score at the end. \n \n Did you once believe\u2026 \n \n Trump will never win the GOP nomination. \n \n Trump will never win the presidency. \n \n Stocks will drop if Trump is elected. \n \n President Trump will deport ten million illegal immigrants. \n \n Trump will be gone (impeached, jailed, or quit) by end of 2017. \n \n Trump\u2019s immigration ban on several Muslim countries will be found unconstitutional. \n \n Trump colluded with Russia, and that\u2019s a crime. \n \n Trump obstructed justice (a crime) by firing Comey. \n \n Trump\u2019s skills as a \u201ccon man\u201d might get him elected but it won\u2019t transfer into doing the job of president. \n \n Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel will cause huge problems. \n \n Trump\u2019s tweeting will cause huge problems. \n \n GOP will never embrace Trump. \n \n Trump will get nothing important done. \n \n Trump will not work effectively with leaders of other countries. \n \n GOP senators will vote against GOP priorities because of President Trump\u2019s mean tweets. \n \n Trump will not nominate qualified judges to the Supreme Court. \n \n Trump is incompetent. \n \n Presidential approval polls are a good predictor of how a president will perform. \n \n The military won\u2019t follow Trump\u2019s orders. \n \n GDP will never stay above 3%. \n \n \u2014 end \u2014 \n \n I didn\u2019t get any of those predictions wrong. But if you got 15 or more wrong, you might want to consider never saying anything about politics out loud again for the rest of your life. Just a suggestion. \n \n Okay, okay. I know you are quibbling with a few items I included on the list. Maybe you think the bad news for Trump \u2014 such as the alleged Russia problems \u2014 will sink Trump eventually. We can revisit this list next year. But if you are wrong for three years straight \u2014 about almost everything Trump-related \u2014 please adjust your confidence in your predictive powers accordingly. \n \n If you got 15 or more of those predictions wrong, please consider reading a copy of my book, Win Bigly, to learn how to use what I call the Persuasion Filter to predict better.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 One common sentiment among political pundits is that Democrats are on track to deliver a political shellacking to Republicans in the 2018 elections. At Fox News, however, Newt Gingrich is predicting the \"great political surprise\" of the new year: Republicans will not only win, they'll win big. \"After members of the elite media have spent two years savaging President Trump, lying about Republican legislation, and reassuring themselves that Republican defeat was inevitable, the size of the GOP victory in 2018 will be an enormous shock,\" writes the former House speaker. One key reason for his prediction is the newly passed Republican tax plan. Ordinary Americans have been told in the press over and over that the changes will hurt them and benefit the rich, he writes. But when people actually receive fatter paychecks next year, Gingrich argues, they'll see the truth. \"In fact, the tax cuts will be the 2018 proving ground of media liberal bias and dishonesty,\" he writes. What's more, he predicts that Democrats who voted against the measure will pay the price in the midterms, particularly the 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in states won by Trump.

    "document": "The world of English-language online media is evolving rapidly. Not only are publications like BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Quartz changing the way readers consume news by merging the law of the click with real news street cred, they\u2019re taking this model beyond US borders. Business Insider struck a deal with Tencent. Quartz has set up a local office in India. \n \n BuzzFeed is often cited as a leader of the new media charge, but for all its innovations, in some capacities it still operates like any other business. News markets must be sought out, entered, and conquered. It has already invested in overseas English markets like the UK and India and, after receiving a US$50 million funding round, BuzzFeed announced that it will expand to Japan, among other non-English speaking countries, by the end of 2014. \n \n Though the company has 27 reasons why moving to Japan is great, it will find one very real competitor upon arrival. \n \n Curazy, a website for humorous, viral observations on Japan and the outside world, is steadily attracting a strong following. Recent articles titles include \u201cWhat is Acrobatic Kissing?\u201d and \u201cEven After Their Owners Became Homeless These 12 Dogs Stayed Completely Faithful\u201d. The site, which launched in January, attracts five million unique users per month and just closed a JPY 100 million (US$964,000) round. \n \n The company only has five full-time employees, lead by Shinnosuke Ito (CEO), Masahiro Kawasaki (head of marketing), and Taisuke Takemoto (head of business). None of the three have prior media experience but they are all entrepreneurs at heart. Ito previously operated a tutoring school via Skype during college, Kawasaki was doing sales for a homepage web developer while working on side projects, and Takemoto, who joined this summer, was running a website design company of his own. \n \n Curazy launched in January 2014, but its operating company, Laugh Tech, first had an interest in manga (comic books in Japan). Ito explained they launched Cosmo in October 2013, only six months after incorporating Laugh Tech (then called Bit Gather). The service was well-regarded and the netted the team the \u201cGoogle Award\u201d at a pitch contest held for Google for Entrepreneurs Week 2013. \n \n Users, however, did not follow the plaudits and the team began planning a pivot. They had already started experimenting with a 9gag clone, Curazy Pix, a simple collection of humorous images. The early feedback was positive, leading the team to work on the release of Curazy. \n \n Looking to the future, Laugh Tech definitely got the memo startups are supposed to set big, audacious goals. The team wants to hit 300 million in monthly pageviews and exit via IPO or acquisition within four years. The pageview goal is definitely a reach considering BuzzFeed \u2013 which does not report pageview data \u2013 recorded 179 million total visits from 25 July 2014 to 23 August 2014 from American alone, according to Quantcast. BuzzFeed\u2019s 150 million unique users, acquired over the past eight years, are also a significant increase from Laugh Tech\u2019s 5 million. \n \n As a start, the company has already expanded outside of Japan. Its Taiwanese incarnation is managed by a husband-wife team who translate some of the Japan site\u2019s content and also add localized pieces. \n \n Early traction is a positive sign but Ito is well aware of BuzzFeed\u2019s position in the digital media market and is no rush to become bitter rivals. In fact, his team has already identified BuzzFeed as a potential acquirer. \u201cBuzzFeed, are you reading [this article]? Buy us!\u201d he said. \n \n Ito\u2019s tongue-in-cheek approach to the company\u2019s future evinces his sure-footed confidence. BuzzFeed may be a behemoth but Ito believes Japan will be difficult to conquer. \u201cHumor is a part of culture, and the culture here is too different,\u201d he said. \n \n 9\u67083\u65e5\u30684\u65e5\u306b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\uff20\u6771\u4eac\u3092\u958b\u50ac\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff018\u670829\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u3001\u5272\u5f15\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9 < latebird >\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\uff01 \n \n Startup Asia Tokyo 2014 is on Sep 3 and 4.

This was almost unchanged from 69.4 percent in the 2008 survey. \n \n Only 26.2 percent backed lowering the age, down 0.5 point. \n \n A 2007 law that specifies procedures for constitutional amendment in principle allows people 18 or above to vote in national referendums. The law calls for discussions on lowering the legal age of adulthood from 20 before it is put into effect. \n \n However, related bills have not been initiated more than three years since its enforcement, due in part to the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s reluctance to lower the age to 18. \n \n According to the survey, 79.4 percent of Japanese object to making 18 the youngest age at which people can conclude contracts to buy expensive items without parental consent, up 0.6 point from the previous survey. Meanwhile, 18.6 percent supported the change, down 0.4 point. \n \n Asked about the minimum age at which people are allowed to adopt children, 51.5 percent answered that it should remain unchanged at 20, down 0.1 point, while 5.9 percent said it should drop to 18, down 0.8 point. \n \n The survey also revealed waning public interest in whether the age of majority should be lowered, with 69.8 percent interested, down 5.6 points, and 29.6 percent saying they have no interest, up 5.6 points. \n \n The Cabinet Office conducted the survey through face-to-face interviews with 5,000 people aged 18 or above nationwide between Oct. 10 and 27.

But while that means an extra two years to enjoy the benefits and protection society affords to minors, everyone has to grow up sometime, and for one Japanese Twitter user the transition was especially abrupt. \n \n On his 20th birthday as his parents presented him with a written notice congratulating him on graduating from childhood and celebrating his newfound freedoms, while spelling out exactly what they, and the world, now expected of him as an adult. \n \n Twitter user @zamayuma1004\u2019s birthday was last weekend, and this year he hit the two-decade mark. On his special day, his parents presented him with this festive-looking envelope. \n \n Normally when someone hands you something like this on your birthday, you expect a birthday card, and the envelope did indeed have \u201cHappy birthday\u201d written on it. What was inside, though, was a little less orthodox. \n \n The paper reads: \n \n Happy 20th Birthday! Notice of Expiration of Child-Rearing Services As of October 4, 2015, your father, Yoshikazu Hasegawa, and mother, Chiaki Hasegawa, have completed their duties of raising their child: you, Yuma Hasegawa. Going forward, please become a proper and responsible member of society, like your father and mother. In addition, should you continue living in the Hasegawa family home, please make a monthly payment of 20,000 yen [US$168] for rent, utility, and grocery expenses. Also, please be aware that should you ask for a loan from your parents, interest will be charged. Points to note upon reaching the age of 20 \n \n \u25cf You must make compulsory national pension payments. If you put this off it will cause problems, so make the payments. \n \n \u25cf Should you commit a crime, your face and name can now be shown on television and in newspapers. You will also have a permanent criminal record. \n \n \u25cf You can now buy alcohol and tobacco products. Do not drive while intoxicated. \n \n \u25cf You can get married without your parents\u2019 permission. However, they may not emotionally accept your wife as their daughter-in-law if you don\u2019t discuss the situation without them beforehand. \n \n \u25cf Think responsibly about the future and set aside an adequate amount of savings from the money you earn. Please enjoy your life as an adult. \n \n Although the document might sound the like the grumblings of a pair of exasperated parents who\u2019ve reached the limits of their patience, @zamayuma1004 says they\u2019ve got their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks. He\u2019s actually been paying the monthly amount mentioned for rent and expenses since last year, and he hopes to do even more to help his parents out in the future. \n \n That said, this is a documented case of pretty tough love by Japanese standards, considering that at the age of 20 much of the population is still attending college or trade school, and that it\u2019s customary to continue living with your parents until getting married or school or work takes you away from your home town. Still, it\u2019s hard to argue with any of the things @zamayuma1004\u2019s parents are saying as they tell him not to let the door of his childhood hit him in the butt on his way out of it. \n \n Source: Curazy \n \n Top image: Twitter/@zamayuma1004 (1, 2) (edited by RocketNews24)",

In Japan, the same milestone means they get hit with rent charges and manifestos from their parents on how they're pretty much on their own now. At least, that's the case for Japanese Twitter user @zamayuma1004, who tweeted photos last week of the special gift his mom and dad presented him on the occasion of his 20th birthday (the Japanese age of majority). Beautifully wrapped in an envelope tied with red and white string was a letter titled \"Notice of Expiration of Child-Rearing Services,\" and its contents proved the parents weren't messing around, RocketNews24 reports via Curazy, Japan's BuzzFeed-style site. \"As of October 4, 2015, your father, Yoshikazu Hasegawa, and mother, Chiaki Hasegawa, have completed their duties of raising their child: you, Yuma Hasegawa,\" the letter reads, per a RocketNews24 translation. \"Going forward, please become a proper and responsible member of society, like your father and mother.\" It then offers a bulleted list of advice for the new adult, including that Yuma pay into his pension, \"not drive while intoxicated,\" and discuss any future possible wife with them or they \"may not emotionally accept\" her. They also mention the $168 they expect for rent and other household expenses and note that \"should you ask for a loan from your parents, interest will be charged.\" \"Please enjoy your life as an adult,\" the note ends.

That's down 5 points from last month and his lowest rating since the center started asking the question in March 2009. Trump has been tweeting about the low rating for days, with the most recent tweet referring to it as a \"watershed moment for our country\" and a \"once in a generation opportunity.\" The Cabinet Office conducted the poll of 5,000 people between Oct. 10 and 27 and found that nearly two-thirds of Americans have a negative view of the president, with \u2013 \"Going forward, please become a proper and responsible member of society, like your father and mother. In addition, should you continue living in the Hasegawa family home, please make a monthly payment of 20,000 yen for rent, utility, and grocery expenses. Also, please be aware that should you ask for a loan from your parents, interest will be charged.\" That's what 20-year-old Japanese Twitter user @zamayuma1004 got when his parents handed him an envelope on his 20th birthday, Mashable reports. Normally, such a birthday gift would include a card with \"Happy birthday\" written on it",

    "document": "Photograph by Brian Harkin/Getty Images. \n \n Almost a year ago, I proposed that Twitter double its character limit from 140 to 280. The microblogging site long ago outgrew its original purpose as a platform for simple status updates. Now people use Twitter for news, jokes, conversations, and ferocious arguments\u2014and 140 characters is too cramped for all of these things. That\u2019s why people often resort to hacks like multipart tweets, ugly textese, and TwitLonger to express their expansive thoughts. Though it would be a bad idea to drop the character limit entirely, allowing up to 280 characters would let people add more heft to their tweets while ensuring they wouldn\u2019t drone on. \n \n Farhad Manjoo Farhad Manjoo is a technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal and the author of True Enough. \n \n \n \n Everyone thought I was nuts. People at the company pointed out that the service is still used by lots of folks who rely on SMS text messaging for access; the 140-character limit was originally chosen so that tweets would fit within texts, and if Twitter dropped it, texters wouldn\u2019t be able to see the bigger tweets. \n \n Lots of folks on Twitter called me a moron, too, and I had a long, mostly incoherent argument about the merits of longer tweets with Mathew Ingram, a blogger at GigaOm, who wrote a piece calling my idea \u201cdumb.\u201d (On Twitter, I tried to tell Ingram that his article was equally dumb for suggesting that I was proposing unlimited-character tweets rather than 280-character tweets, but of course Twitter\u2019s dumb character limit made the whole argument dumb.) And not long ago, I went to a dinner at which Twitter CEO Dick Costolo talked about the bad advice people had given the company over the years. One of his examples was the recurrent proposal to drop the character limit. The audience laughed and laughed at the stupidity of the idea. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n Imagine my surprise, then, when I read last week that Twitter is beginning to push past the sacrosanct 140. In a blog post, the company announced the creation of \u201cexpanded tweets,\u201d which will allow for \u201cinteractive experiences\u201d within boring old text-laden posts. Technically, all tweets can still be only 140 characters long. But the company is letting select organizations\u2014including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed, TMZ, and the WWE\u2014append more stuff to tweets that reference their content. \n \n For instance, if I link to an article from the Times, my followers will now see a little button on the tweet labeled \u201cView summary.\u201d If you click that, you\u2019ll see hundreds more characters: The article\u2019s headline, the author\u2019s byline and Twitter handle, the publication\u2019s Twitter handle, a photo from the piece, and even a short snippet from the article. Here\u2019s what an expanded tweet will look like: \n \n How many characters is all that? Twitter has posted guidelines for sites looking to create these in-tweet \u201cmedia experiences,\u201d and they specify exactly how much more expansive the new tweets can be. Headlines in supersized tweets can be 70 characters long. Snippets can be 200 characters long. And that\u2019s on top of the main tweet, which can be 140 characters long. Add it all up and you get 410 characters! I can already picture the billboard. Expanded Tweets\u2014fortified with 270 more characters! \n \n But I kid. I think expanded tweets are a great development for Twitter, a way to add depth to the service while still clinging to its hyperabridged roots. In truth, expanded tweets have been around for a while\u2014if you include a picture or a video as part of a Twitter message, then your followers can click to see it. This continued tweet expansion was inevitable. A shrinking percentage of Twitter\u2019s userbase accesses the site through SMS, so the 140-character limit was becoming increasingly arbitrary (SMS users will still see all Tweets, but they won\u2019t be able to see the expanded summaries). Instead, most of us get our tweets on the Web and on smartphones, venues that allow for richer content. \n \n As expanded tweets roll out to all users on all devices, we\u2019ll find that posts which pack 410 characters worth of information will make the network a deeper, more coherent source of news and conversation. \n \n For one thing, expanded tweets will make Twitter feel less disjointed. Today, if you see a friend linking to an article of mine with a note, \u201cGreatest article ever!!!!!\u201d you might accidentally click on the story without knowing it\u2019s another dumb Farhad Manjoo piece. Expanded tweets will let you see what\u2019s behind links before you click on them. They\u2019ll also let you follow your favorite writers right from tweets that link to their pieces. And as Twitter adds similar expansive summaries of other kinds of content\u2014perhaps you\u2019ll be able to see reviews when someone links to an Amazon product, or maybe Twitter will let me quote a 200-word summary of an article when I link to it\u2014the experience will become more engaging. Twitter won\u2019t be a place that\u2019s always sending you away to other things. Instead, it will become a destination. \n \n One criticism of expanded tweets is that Twitter has only allowed a few organizations to get expansive. Why do links to the New York Times get expanded but not links to your favorite Ryan Gosling-themed Tumblr? As blogger Dave Winer put it, \u201cno one should think that this is a level playing field, that all content is treated equally, because that is not true.\u201d \n \n In a conversation with a Twitter spokeswoman, though, I got the sense that the preferential treatment is only temporary, part of a slow rollout of a complex technical change. At the moment, Twitter is letting any site apply to have its content show up as expanded summaries. Over time, it seems likely that more and more sites will be allowed to automatically expand into summaries within tweets. So not long from now, when someone links to a post from Is Ryan Gosling Cuter Than a Puppy?, you\u2019ll be able to see both Ryan and the puppy right in the tweet, and perhaps even cast your vote there, too. \n \n A bigger-picture criticism is that, by offering more and more stuff within each tweet, Twitter risks becoming something altogether different from a quick-update site. This fear rests on the idea that there\u2019s something mystical and poetic about the current character limit. Many people argue that it inspires creativity, and that without it, Twitter would get bogged down in endless talk and too many flashy things. Costolo himself has fretted about this. In an interview with Fortune last year, the CEO was asked whether he felt pressure to make Twitter more dynamic in response to other, more feature-rich social networks. \u201cYou know, if you just look in the sideview mirror at what are particular companies doing, and then you start to say, \u2018Twitter is going to be the world in your pocket\u2014now with video chat!\u2019\u2014then you lose your way, right?\" Costolo said. \"So, we're going to offer simplicity in a world of complexity, focus on our goal, while we understand what everyone else is doing.\" \n \n Expanding tweets isn\u2019t quite the same thing as adding video chat to Twitter\u2014but it\u2019s moving in that direction. The cynical view is that Costolo is rolling out expanded tweets for commercial reasons. In the same way that the new feature will show you a snippet from a new article, supersized tweets would let McDonald\u2019s offer you an in-tweet coupon for super-sized fries. ||||| Starting today, you can discover more interactive experiences inside any Tweet on twitter.com and mobile.twitter.com. When you expand Tweets containing links to partner websites, you can now see content previews, view images, play videos and more. \n \n You\u2019ve probably expanded Tweets before to play videos from YouTube or see photos from Instagram. Now, a diverse and growing group of new partners like the The Wall Street Journal, Breaking News, and TIME also deliver rich content inside Tweets containing a link to those websites. \n \n It\u2019s easier than ever to discover breaking news and bylines. When you expand a Tweet linking to a news article by The New York Times, The San Francisco Chronicle or Der Spiegel Online, you can see a preview with the headline, the introduction and sometimes the Twitter accounts of the publisher and writer. You can continue to read the article, follow these accounts, and reply, favorite or retweet the Tweet. \n \n You can also see exclusive photos from inside the WWE ring, or images from sources like BuzzFeed and TMZ. \n \n You can even watch moments from your favorite television shows like BET\u2019s 106 & Park and play video from partners like Lifetime and Dailymotion. \n \n This easy new way to discover content from the web begins rolling out to everyone on twitter.com and mobile.twitter.com starting today, and it\u2019s coming soon to Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for Android. \n \n - Michael Sippey, Director, Product Team (@sippey)",

    "document": "UPDATED: Megyn Kelly\u2019s two-day bad streak just got worse. Deadline hears that the NBC News host who caused such a ruckus with her on-air remarks about blackface and her ensuing apology is no longer a client of CAA and will not be repped by UTA. Kelly has hired leading Hollywood attorney Bryan Freedman as she is heading to likely settlement talks with NBC. She is not expected to be hosting her 9 AM show for the rest of the week. \n \n The news comes as the backlash continues over her comments during Megyn Kelly Today on Tuesday about why it\u2019s not OK for people to wear blackface as a Halloween costume. Fallout from the comments continued today as NBC News chief Andy Lack criticized Kelly during a town hall with staffers and praised the work done by his Today, Nightly News and late-night teams. \n \n Kelly reportedly had plotted a move from CAA to UTA shortly before the controversy erupted earlier this week. She had left CAA and was close to signing with UTA but the agency now would not proceed with bringing her in as a client under the circumstances. She instead has retained an attorney in Freedman. \n \n NBC \n \n It also was revealed this afternoon that cast members and EPs of Netflix\u2019s House of Cards pulled out of guesting on Megyn Kelly Today amid the controversy. \n \n On her show Tuesday, Kelly and a panel were discussing campus attempts to discourage \u201cinappropriate and offensive costumes\u201d during the trick-or-treat season when Kelly asked: \u201cWhat is racist? \u2026 You do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface for Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween.\u201d \n \n The outcry on social media was swift, and Kelly was forced to apologize later in the day. In a note to colleagues, she wrote: \u201cToday is one of those days where listening carefully to other points of view, including from friends and colleagues, is leading me to rethink my own views.\u201d Kelly added that she \u201cnow\u201d realizes that it is \u201cindeed wrong\u201d and that \u201cthe history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent, the wounds too deep.\u201d ||||| New York (CNN Business) Two years of pent-up bitterness and backbiting about Megyn Kelly have finally come to a head at NBC News. \n \n Her exit from the 9 a.m. hour of the \"Today\" show appears to be imminent. Variety reported on Wednesday evening that Kelly and NBC News executives have been holding conversations about a new role for her. \n \n Two people familiar with the matter confirmed that to CNN Business and said Kelly's show will be ending. Negotiations about the end date and other details are still underway. But Kelly will not be hosting Thursday's program, and she is unlikely to return later, one of the people said. So \"Megyn Kelly Today\" may end very soon. \n \n Kelly has parted ways with her talent agency, CAA, according to two sources, and she has hired attorney Bryan Freedman. \n \n Kelly's offensive remarks about blackface Halloween costumes on Tuesday have raised more questions about her future at NBC. Spokespeople for NBC News declined to comment, and most staffers at the news division remain in the dark. \n \n Tuesday's controversy made national news and stoked disappointment and resentment within NBC, according to multiple sources at the network. \n \n Kelly started her show on Wednesday by apologizing for comments made the previous day. Her audience gave her a standing ovation, but disappointment inside NBC News runs deep and isn't likely to fade anytime soon. \n \n NBC News chair Andy Lack condemned her racially insensitive comments during a town hall meeting with staffers on Wednesday morning. (The meeting was scheduled well before the controversy ensued.) \n \n Lack spearheaded Kelly's hiring and championed her 9 a.m. show. But this week his news division has covered the Kelly controversy on multiple programs. Instead of promoting the \"Today\" show as a happy family, NBC has aired the family's fight \u2014 giving time to Al Roker and others who strongly criticized Kelly's comments. \n \n Tuesday's blackface talk \u2014 featuring an all-white panel of guests \u2014 was a major misstep. But the Kelly rancor is about more than one segment. \n \n The New York Times reported on Wednesday evening that Kelly and Lack \"discussed a possible winding-down of her portion of the 'Today' show by the end of the year,\" meaning the conversations pre-dated this week's controversy. \n \n Kelly has many critics and rivals within the famed news division \u2014 people who say she never should have been hired from Fox News, certainly not for such a huge salary, and certainly not for a morning show like \"Megyn Kelly Today.\" \n \n These NBC staffers routinely call Kelly's show a \"disaster\" and other disparaging terms. \n \n Most of the anger isn't directed at her, exactly, but at the management of NBC News \u2014 the men who hired her away from Fox in January 2017. \n \n \"We're lucky to have her,\" Lack said on the day her new deal was announced. \n \n At the time, some other TV executives agreed. After all, there had been a bidding war for Kelly when it became clear that she wanted to leave Fox. \n \n Lack called her an \"exceptional journalist and news anchor.\" \n \n But Kelly was best known for fiery segments on Fox's staunchly conservative prime time schedule. There was widespread concern that she was being miscast at NBC. \n \n The network said she would have two main jobs: A 9 a.m. talk show and a Sunday night newsmagazine. Her reported salary of $23 million a year for three years, totaling $69 million, became a bit of a scandal inside NBC, even before she started on the air. \n \n Kelly's morning show premiered in September of 2017. Television critics found a lot to criticize. And Kelly had some early stumbles, like an awkward exchange with Jane Fonda that made headlines for a long time afterward. \n \n Some of the controversies stoked curiosity about her new show, but mostly it just caused embarrassment and snickering about how long she would last at NBC. Most importantly, the 9 a.m. show did not meet ratings expectations. \n \n As the Wall Street Journal put it in a headline earlier this year, \"NBC bet $69 million on Megyn Kelly \u2014 then viewers vanished.\" \n \n Kelly's rivals noted that the earlier iteration of the 9 a.m. hour was more profitable back when Roker and Tamron Hall were the hosts. That's partly because they were paid a lot less. \n \n Some people in the TV business said Kelly was given bad career advice. Others said NBC was unrealistic about expectations for her show. And still others said Kelly's talent was not easily transferable from Fox to other networks. \n \n NBC introduced Kelly's Sunday newsmagazine, but the program didn't last long. As predicted, it suffered in the ratings versus long-running competitors like \"60 Minutes,\" and it was hobbled by scheduling issues. \n \n On the air, Kelly's morning show has notched some wins \u2014 her show has been full of fascinating conversations and candid interviews. But it is still a ratings laggard. And the blackface controversy reinforces the perception \u2014 to the public at large \u2014 that Kelly is a Fox News personality, not a member of the \"Today\" show family. \n \n During the offending segment on Tuesday, Kelly said it was OK when she was growing up for white people to dress up as black characters, and she spoke out against a controversy that erupted last year over a reality star who portrayed Diana Ross. \n \n \"But what is racist?\" Kelly asked. \"Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween. Back when I was a kid that was OK, as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character.\" \n \n Later in the day, Kelly said sorry to her colleagues in an email: \"Today is one of those days where listening carefully to other points of view, including from friends and colleagues, is leading me to rethink my own views.\" \n \n On Tuesday evening, \"NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\" covered the Kelly story when few other networks paid it much attention. Roker, Melvin and other members of the \"Today\" show cast had a remarkably candid conversation about the controversy during the 7 a.m. hour of the show on Wednesday. \n \n The situation demonstrates the continuing unease about and disarray within NBC News over Kelly, whose hire and installation in the network's morning hours was controversial. \n \n Roker said \"she owes a bigger apology to folks of color across the country.\" \n \n His blunt words expressed a point of view shared by many within the news organization. \n \n \"Today\" colleague Craig Melvin also called out Kelly's comments for being \"stupid\" and \"indefensible.\" He pointed out that this controversy is an opportunity to inform people \u2014 but said most people already knew how offensive blackface is. ||||| Megyn Kelly and NBC News have engaged in conversations about her taking a new role at the news division, according to a person who has spoken with the anchor, suggesting both sides have grown weary of the intense scrutiny being placed on her morning program, \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d and casting significant doubt on its future. \n \n Word of the shift comes after Kelly stirred outrage on Tuesday during a segment in which she questioned why it was wrong for people to don \u201cblackface\u201d for Halloween costumes. The backlash contributed to CAA dropping Kelly as a client on Wednesday, according to an industry source (and first reported by the Hollywood Reporter). \n \n But the conversations about ending the 9 a.m. daytime show began before the controversy, the latest since the anchor joined NBC News in March of 2017. \n \n \u201dWhere do you think Megyn Kelly would be happier, as part of big breaking news or forced to cover light-hearted stories that traditionally work at 9 a.m.?\u201d the source close to Kelly said. Kelly participated in NBC News\u2019 coverage of the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh and is slated to take part in NBC News\u2019 election-night coverage on Nov. 6. \n \n Related NBCUniversal Chief on Megyn Kelly, Andy Lack and Future of NBC News Megyn Kelly, NBC Reach Agreement on Exit \n \n NBC News declined to comment. \n \n After Tuesday\u2019s segment, social-media opprobrium came quickly, as did an apology from the anchor. NBC News has continued to cover the fallout for Kelly over the incident on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d and \u201cToday,\u201d prompting speculation about the relationship between the high-priced star anchor and others in the news division. \n \n Success in daytime TV has always been elusive. Other famous anchors have tried their hand in mornings and afternoons in the recent past, and met with middling success. Katie Couric, Anderson Cooper and Meredith Vieira are among the personalities who tackled daytime talk programs in the last few years. All three lasted just two seasons before ending their respective efforts. \n \n \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d has been a work in progress. At times, it has garnered good notice for Kelly\u2019s willingness to examine tough issues and the #MeToo social-justice movement. She did not shy away from a discussion about the late-2017 ouster of Matt Lauer after NBC News found allegations of sexual harassment levied at him. The anchor has denied some of the charges made against him. In other instances, however, the show has brought unwanted attention, including Kelly\u2019s scolding of actress Jane Fonda. Media buyers said Wednesday that the program had proven to be a disappointment after NBC hyped Kelly\u2019s arrival to its air. \n \n NBC News Chairman Andy Lack addressed this week\u2019s controversy Wednesday at a town hall meeting with news staffers. \u201cThere is no other way to put this but I condemn those remarks, there is no place on our air or in this workplace for them. Very unfortunate,\u201d Lack said, according to people present at the meeting. He added: \u201cAs we go forward, my highest priority remains, and as we sort through this with Megyn, let there be no doubt that this is a workplace in which you need to be proud and in which we respect each other in all the ways we know is foundational to who we are.\u201d \n \n Kelly kicked off her morning show in the fall of a 2017 with a stated desire to get away from the political commentary that fueled her rise at Fox News Channel. \u201cI\u2019m kind of done with politics for now,\u201d Kelly told the audience during her first morning broadcast, noting she she hoped instead to help viewers \u201cget yourself through the day, to have a laugh with us, a smile, sometimes a tear \u2013 and maybe a little hope to start your day. Some fun! That\u2019s what we want to be doing.\u201d \n \n In recent days, however, the anchor has steered the panel discussions that open \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d toward hotter topics, such as the nomination hearings around Justice Kavanaugh and debates around political correctness.",

The source says both sides have grown weary of the intense scrutiny being placed on her show, suggesting both sides are looking for a way out. Kelly apologized for her comments Tuesday, and on Wednesday, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack condemned them at a town hall meeting with news staffers. \"There is no other way to put this but I condemn those remarks, there is no place on our air or in this workplace for them. Very unfortunate,\" Lack said, according to people present at the meeting. \"As we go forward, my highest priority remains, and as we sort through this with Megyn, let there be no doubt that this is a workplace in which you need to be proud and in which we respect each other in all the ways we know is foundational to who we are.\" (Kelly's agent has dropped her as a client.)",

That\u2019s the takeaway from IRS data, analyzed by Forbes, on moves between counties. We looked for counties that the rich are moving to in big numbers. \n \n Topping the list: Collier County, Fla., which includes the city of Naples. Tax returns accounting for 15,150 people showed moves to Collier County from other parts of the country in 2008, the latest year for which IRS data is available. Their average reported income: $76,161 per person\u2013equivalent to $304,644 for a family of four. Although slightly more taxpayers moved out of Collier County than into it, the departing residents\u2019 average income came out to just $26,128 per person. \n \n Interactive Map: Where Americans Are Moving \n \n Slide Show: Where America\u2019s Rich Are Going (And Leaving) \n \n Households that moved to Collier County principally came from other parts of Florida, with Lee, Miami Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Orange counties leading the list. Big northern cities also sent lots of migrants: Cook County, Ill. (home to Chicago); Oakland County, Mich. (near Detroit); and Suffolk County, N.Y. (on Long Island) each sent more than 100 people to Collier County during 2008. \n \n In second place is Greene County, Ga., with a population of just 15,743 at the Census Bureau\u2019s last estimate. The IRS data show that in 2008, 788 people moved to the county, about 75 miles east of Atlanta. \n \n Rounding out the top five: Nassau County, Fla., near Jacksonville; Llano County, Texas, 70 miles northwest of Austin; and Walton County, Fla., 80 miles east of Pensacola. \n \n The dominance of the list by Florida and Texas\u2013the former has eight of the top 20 counties, the latter four\u2013 makes sense to Robert Shrum, manager of state affairs at the Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C., since neither state has an income tax. \u201cIf you\u2019re a high-income earner, then that, from a tax perspective, is going to be a driving decider if you\u2019re going to move to one of those two states,\u201d Shrum says. \n \n After accounting for property taxes, Shrum\u2019s analysis shows that Texas has the fourth-lowest personal tax burden in the country, and Florida has the eighth lowest. Shrum also points to eight states that have targeted wealthy households with extra-high tax brackets: California, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Hawaii, Oregon, Connecticut and Wisconsin. Six of the top 10 counties the rich are fleeing are located in those states. \n \n Pitkin County, Colo., home to the pricey Aspen ski community, where home listings average more than $3.5 million, saw an exodus of rich people in 2008 as the economy began to contract. The 962 tax filers and dependents who left Pitkin had an average income of $71,473 per capita, while the equivalent figure for those moving to the county was $30,000 lower. Of those leaving Pitkin County, 224 moved to neighboring Garfield County where, according to real estate information service Trulia, homes list for 75% less than those in Pitkin County. IRS data also show movement from the resort area to cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco. \n \n Behind the Numbers \n \n \n \n To find places the rich are moving, Forbes used IRS data on household moves broken down by county and income. We included counties where arriving households are richer than households that didn\u2019t move and departing households are poorer than households that didn\u2019t move. The final ranking orders counties by the difference in per-capita income between incoming households and those that didn\u2019t move. \n \n Our ranking of places the rich are fleeing essentially reverses these criteria, looking for counties where departing households are wealthier than the population as a whole and where incoming households are poorer. \n \n In order to find patterns among the wealthy, we restricted the lists to counties where departing or arriving households had per-capita incomes of $35,000 or more. That figure is equivalent to an annual income of $140,000 for a family of four\u2013a very high income for any large subset of the American population (of 3,142 counties with IRS data, only 130 have average incomes above this level). And in order to avoid statistical anomalies, we only included counties with at least 500 people listed as arriving or departing. \n \n This technique essentially finds new hot spots\u2013places that aren\u2019t necessarily wealthy now but where wealthy people are moving. Some upscale places like Westchester County, N.Y., and Teton County, Wy., don\u2019t make the list because people moving into those counties aren\u2019t as rich as the people who already live there. \n \n The IRS warns that these counts are only approximations; because they don\u2019t include households that don\u2019t file income tax returns, poor and elderly people are underrepresented. These counts also don\u2019t include returns filed after late-September 2009\u2013a small fraction of total returns that tends to include some very rich people with complex returns who file for extensions. \n \n Slide Show: Where America\u2019s Rich Are Going (And Leaving)",

    "document": "A bit of a startling moment happened near the end of Monday night's CNN debate when a hypothetical question was posed to Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). \n \n \"What do you tell a guy who is sick, goes into a coma and doesn't have health insurance? Who pays for his coverage? Are you saying society should just let him die?\" Wolf Blitzer asked. \n \n \"Yeah!\" several members of the crowd yelled out. \n \n Paul interjected to offer an explanation for how this was, more-or-less, the root choice of a free society. He added that communities and non-government institutions can fill the void that the public sector is currently playing. \n \n \"We never turned anybody away from the hospital,\" he said of his volunteer work for churches and his career as a doctor. \"We have given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves, assume responsibility for ourselves ... that's the reason the cost is so high.\" ||||| TAMPA, FL -- The morning after a sometimes-rocky appearance in front of a Tea Party debate audience, Gov. Rick Perry said he was \"taken aback\" by cheers from some crowd members on a hypothetical question of whether a young man who decides not to buy health insurance should be refused care if he develops a life-threatening illness and be left to die. \n \n \"I was a bit taken aback by that myself,\" Perry told NBC News and the Miami Herald after appearing at a breakfast fundraiser in Tampa. \n \n \"We're the party of life. We ought to be coming up with ways to save lives.\" \n \n Perry distinguished from that the issue of \"justice,\" reiterating his strong support and \"respect\" for the death penalty on a state-by-state basis. \"But the Republican party ought to be about life and protecting, particularly, innocent life,\" he added. \n \n Perry also responded to the crowd's negative reaction to his support for allowing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, saying his campaign has \"the right message\" on opportunities for children who were brought to the United States illegally \"by no fault of their own.\" \n \n \"This issue is about education, it's not about immigration,\" he said. \n \n \"These kids showed up in our state by no fault of their own, some 2-3 years of age. And they've been in our schools, they've done their work, they've prepared themselves good, they want to be contributing members of society. So it would be I think the wrong message to say somehow or another that you can't go to our colleges, or we've going to punish you because of the sound of your last name.\" \n \n \"When people really think about it, I think they'll understand what we did in Texas was the right thing for Texas,\" he said. \n \n Last night's debate also featured shots at Perry from both Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum on the issue of Gardasil, a vaccine that Perry mandated to be given to 12-year-old girls to prevent HPV - a disease linked to cervical cancer. \n \n Bachmann said on NBC's TODAY Show this morning that she was approached by a woman after the debate whose daughter had suffered mental retardation as a result of getting the vaccine. \n \n Perry dismissed that idea as similar to debunked theories linking vaccinations to autism. \n \n \"You heard the same arguments about giving our children protections from some of the childhood diseases, and they were, autism was part of that. Now we've subsequently found out that was generated and not true.\" \n \n \"I would suggest to you that this issue about Gardasil and making it available was about saving people's lives,\" he added.",

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \n \n Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may be considering resigning from his job as frustrations with the Trump administration may have him nearing the end of his rope. \n \n People \"familiar with Tillerson conversations with friends outside Washington\" told CNN the mood in Foggy Bottom's Mahogany Row has grown increasingly dark in recent days, particularly since President Donald Trump gave an interview to The New York Times in which he publicly rebuked Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Tillerson and others are said to also be troubled by the turmoil at the White House, resulting in last week's shake up of Trump's legal team, the hiring of new communications director Anthony Scaramucci and the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer. \n \n Tillerson has been criticized for his absence on the world stage as the Trump administration has left allies concerned with the U.S.' commitment to its agreements and the president's continued warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. \n \n Tillerson's silence has at times been attributed to his disapproval of the president's actions and policies, and those of the people around him. \n \n Speculation that Tillerson may leave by the end of the year \u2013 after reorganizing the State Department \u2013 has been circulating for weeks. The former CEO of ExxonMobil has been open about his reluctance to work in government, saying in March that he \"didn't want this job.\" \n \n Tillerson's frustrations with the White House increased in late June when he lashed out at Johnny DeStefano, the White House's personnel director, about the State Department's decimated ranks. \n \n According to CNN, two sources close to Tillerson said they sensed a change in recent days, predicting a \"Rexit\" sooner than originally rumored -- though the sources also acknowledged Tillerson may simply have been \"venting after a tough week\" and may not mean he's headed out the door immediately. \n \n ||||| Washington (CNN) Talk of a potential \"Rexit\" at Foggy Bottom, new tests for President Trump on immigration, tax reform and media relations and a big challenge for the nation's oldest civil rights organization -- it's all part of our Inside Politics Forecast. \n \n 1) A chill across the executive branch -- and new rumblings from State Department \n \n There was a decided chill across the executive branch as last week came to a close after a tumultuous series of events that rattled worker bees and caught the attention of Cabinet secretaries. \n \n A large part of that dynamic was the result of the White House staff shakeup -- which saw President Trump overruling top advisers to hire Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, and the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer. \n \n Bigger, though, were the continuing conversations about The New York Times interview in which Trump sharply criticized his attorney general and longtime supporter -- Jeff Sessions -- saying it was \"unfair to the President\" that Sessions recused himself from any decisions related to the Russia election meddling investigation. \n \n Among those who viewed the President's public rebuke of Sessions as unprofessional, according to several sources, is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon-Mobil CEO. \n \n Tillerson has a growing list of differences with the White House, including a new debate over Iran policy and personnel. His frustration is hardly a secret and it has spilled out publicly at times. But friends sense a change of late. \n \n For weeks, conversations with Tillerson friends outside of Washington have left the impression that he, despite his frustrations, was determined to stay on the job at least through the end of the year. That would allow time to continue efforts to reorganize the State Department and would mean he could claim to have put in a year as America's top diplomat. \n \n But two sources who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity over the weekend said they would not be surprised if there was a \"Rexit\" from Foggy Bottom sooner that that. \n \n Both of these sources are familiar with Tillerson conversations with friends outside Washington. Both said there was a noticeable increase in the secretary's frustration and his doubts that the tug-of-war with the White House would subside anytime soon. They also acknowledged it could have been venting after a tough week, a suggestion several DC-based sources made when asked if they saw evidence Tillerson was looking for an exit strategy. \n \n 2) Tax reform next? White House nervous as it eyes clock \n \n Trump pushed again Saturday for GOP senators to resolve their differences and settle on an Obamacare repeal and replace package. The White House wants a win, and worries failure will further damage the President's political standing. \n \n Some top Trump aides are worried about the calendar --- believing all this time spent on health care, without success, might have a domino effect on another top White House priority. \n \n Julie Hirshfeld Davis of The New York Times detailed the anxiety over finding a path toward tax reform. \n \n \"What we're seeing, what we're hearing, from these meetings that have been going on behind the scenes with Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, Gary Cohn, the National Economic Council director and the top congressional leaders on the Republican side is that they're sort of starting to think about potentially trimming their sales and not doing a big massive tax reform but instead a tax cut,\" Davis said. \"There is a lot of uncertainty about whether they're even going to be able to get that this year.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED Why tax reform is so hard Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why tax reform is so hard 02:05 \n \n 3) A reset -- with the media? \n \n New White House communications chief, Antony Scaramucci, is a feisty defender of President Trump \n \n But even as he echoes the President in tossing around the \"Fake News\" label, he also says he is looking to rebalance the White House relationship with traditional or mainstream media outlets. \n \n The timing, Michael Shear of The New York Times suggests, could at least present a genuine opportunity. \n \n \"There could be an opportunity for a press reboot over some of the issues that the press corps has been arguing with the White House for: access to the President, press conferences, on-camera briefings,\" Shear said. \n \n \"There is a new White House Correspondents' Association president who is coming in, as it happens, at exactly the same time that we have a new communications director and head of the communications shop.\" \n \n The moral of that story? It'll be a wait-and-see moment for White House reporters. \n \n JUST WATCHED Scaramucci: Trump unsure of Russia meddling Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Scaramucci: Trump unsure of Russia meddling 01:34 \n \n 4) DREAM Act push -- lost cause or a chance for clarity? \n \n Trump has sent mixed signals about policy toward so-called Dreamers -- undocumented workers who came to the United States illegally but at an age when they were too young to be responsible for that decision. \n \n During the campaign, he at times promised to reverse Obama administration protections extended to them. He has not done so as President, and he has on several occasions discussed how difficult it is for him to square his tougher views on immigration with understanding and compassion for a group that is otherwise law-abiding and did not make a decision to break the law. \n \n A new push in Congress could offer a chance to bring some clarity to the Dreamer question. The Atlantic's Molly Ball discussed the possibility of a revised version of the so-called DREAM Act, and its bipartisan sponsors: Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \n \n \"It might seem like a strange time to be doing that. But this administration has sent very conflicting signals about DACA,\" Ball said. \n \n \"There are some state attorneys general that have imposed a deadline on the administration to basically tell them whether this is going to go or stay. They have been issuing work permits. And so Lindsey Graham at the press conference introducing this said, you know, President Trump, you can really sort of act against type, you can solve this problem.\" \n \n 5) NAACP meets this week -- no presidential visit -- but a Democratic parade \n \n The nation's oldest civil rights organization -- the NAACP -- holds its annual meeting this week amid a host of questions about how to navigate American politics and policy in the Trump years. \n \n Trump declined an invitation to attend Several Democrats thinking about the 2020 presidential campaign are scheduled to speak. CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson shared her reporting on how this legacy organization is trying to modernize its approach. \n \n \"The question there, how does this very old, the oldest civil rights organization in the country, reboot and re-imagine themselves in the Trump era and the era of Black Lives Matter? And in the era of resistance? They invited Donald Trump. He said 'no,' he wasn't going to come,\" Henderson said. \n \n \"Eric Holder will be there. He'll be talking about gerrymandering -- something that's very important to Democrats particularly. Also, it's being looked at as something of a 2020 cattle call. Also in attendance, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders, of course, struggled a bit with getting African-American support when he ran last go around. So we'll see what those folks have to offer.\" ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frustration is mounting among leading foreign policy officials in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration as they chafe at some policy and bureaucratic defeats and complain they lack independence to do their jobs, officials say. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends a joint news conference with Qatar's foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in Doha, Qatar, July 11, 2017. REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoon \n \n The clash between internationalists urging the traditional U.S. leadership role in the world and advocates of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach has worn down foreign policy and intelligence professionals inside the government, according to the officials. \n \n Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has told friends he will be lucky to last a year in his job, according to a friend, while two officials said national security adviser H.R. McMaster was frustrated by what he sees as disorganization and indiscipline on key policy issues inside the White House. \n \n A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that Tillerson was \u201cvery upset at not having autonomy, independence and control over his own department and the ability to do the job the way the job ... is traditionally done.\u201d \n \n The source said he had heard nothing about any possible departure, but added: \u201cThe situation doesn\u2019t seem to be getting any better, and in some respects appears to be getting worse.\u201d \n \n R.C. Hammond, Tillerson\u2019s spokesman, denied Tillerson was considering leaving or that his frustrations were boiling over, saying he had \u201cplenty of reasons to stay on the job, and all of them are important to America.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a desperate need for American leadership in the world and that\u2019s where the secretary\u2019s focusing his attention,\u201d he said. \n \n Tillerson scored a policy win last week when the administration certified, albeit reluctantly, that Iran was complying with the 2015 nuclear deal under which Tehran agreed to restrain its atomic program in exchange for sanctions relief. \n \n He was upset, however, by fierce internal criticism from Trump, as well as his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and White House aide Sebastian Gorka, over the decision, said another U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n \u201cThe secretary does not feel that White House staff members should be in a position to conduct hostile cross-(examinations) of Cabinet officials,\u201d the official said. \n \n Hammond disputed the account of harsh discord between Trump and Tillerson regarding recertifying the Iran nuclear deal, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t buy this whole thing that there are tensions. Developing public policy is about vetting out ideas,\u201d he said. \n \n Following last month\u2019s move by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to boycott Qatar, which they accuse of financing extremist groups and supporting terrorism, Tillerson publicly asked the nations to ease their blockade, and put the onus on both sides to end the crisis. \n \n Less than 90 minutes later, Trump accused Qatar of being a \u201chigh level\u201d sponsor of terrorism and suggested he had helped plan the Qatar action with Arab leaders. \n \n \u201cAs a government we offered some confusing signals, but we\u2019ve since been able to clear up and clarify that,\u201d Hammond said. \n \n Politico reported last month that Tillerson was furious with Johnny DeStefano, the head of the presidential personnel office, for torpedoing proposed nominees to key State Department posts. \n \n \u2018DISRUPTIVE FIGURE\u2019 \n \n Senior national security officials said McMaster was dismayed that his recommendations, backed by his senior director for Russia, Fiona Hill, about taking a tough stance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, had been ignored. \n \n Trump has questioned the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to try to help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n \n McMaster, a three-star Army general who once praised Trump as a \u201cdisruptive\u201d figure, is also troubled by a protracted debate about sending more U.S. forces to help Afghanistan reverse gains by the Taliban, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. \n \n Slideshow (2 Images) \n \n Asked to respond to the characterizations of the views of McMaster and other officials, a White House official said: \u201cAssertions not of fact but of state of mind in internal thought have no place in a story like this.\u201d \n \n While circumspect, Tillerson talked about the challenges of his new job earlier this month, telling reporters that it differed from his former role as chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, where \u201cI was the ultimate decision-maker. That always makes life easier.\u201d \n \n \u201cI knew what to expect and we had very long-standing disciplined processes and decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are not the characteristics of the United States government.\u201d ||||| Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is growing increasingly frustrated with the Trump administration and could quit before the year is through, according to reports. \n \n Two sources familiar with Tillerson\u2019s conversations with friends told CNN over the weekend that he has grown so frustrated with President Donald Trump and his administration that there may soon be a \u201cRexit.\u201d \n \n The change in Tillerson\u2019s tone followed a stressful week for the secretary of state. He was found to have violated U.S. sanctions against Russia while working as CEO of Exxon Mobil. Also, Trump publicly assailed one of Tillerson\u2019s fellow Cabinet members, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying he regretted hiring him. \n \n Joshua Roberts/Reuters \n \n Tillerson, the sources said, viewed Trump\u2019s comments as unprofessional. \n \n Early Monday, Trump again attacked Sessions on Twitter, calling him \u201cbeleaguered\u201d and wondering aloud why he wasn\u2019t investigating Trump\u2019s campaign rival Hillary Clinton. \n \n Before last week, Tillerson had strongly maintained he would see through his task of reorganizing the entire State Department after Trump\u2019s March budget proposal laid out plans to cut $10 billion from its roughly $47 billion in funding. But that resolve seems to have dimmed. \n \n The sources acknowledged that Tillerson could have been venting after a tough week, but his frustration is just the latest in a long list of times he has butted heads with the president and his administration. \n \n Related: \u2018Unprofessional\u2019 Rex Tillerson gives meddling White House staffers an earful \n \n Last month, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner was the one calling Tillerson \u201cunprofessional.\u201d The secretary of state reportedly blew up at top Trump administration staffers during a meeting in White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus\u2019s office. \n \n Four people familiar with the details of the meeting described the heated exchange to Politico. During his tirade, Tillerson quarreled with the director of presidential personnel, Johnny DeStefano, and made clear he didn\u2019t want the White House to \u201chave any role in staffing.\u201d \n \n Tillerson has been frustrated after Trump and the White House rejected a number of his hiring decisions. Early this year, Trump vetoed Tillerson\u2019s plan to hire Elliott Abrams as his second in command because Abrams was critical of Trump and his policy positions during the 2016 campaign. \n \n Early this year, Tillerson was also left scrambling, along with other Cabinet members, in doing damage control after the administration implemented a ban on foreign travel to the U.S. from six Muslim-majority nations. The Cabinet was not consulted beforehand. The move gathered serious legal pushback and is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court this fall. \n \n In late June, the White House also failed to coordinate with the State Department when it issued a warning to the Syrian regime about using chemical weapons. Such warnings are usually issued through, or at least coordinated with, the State Department. \n \n Trump has also contradicted and overruled Tillerson's public statements about whether the U.S. should mediate in a dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. \n \n Both sources said that Tillerson\u2019s frustrations with these situations, and many other tug-of-wars between the White House and Cabinet members, are increasing noticeably and that he has come to realize things won\u2019t change anytime soon.",

That one quotes two insiders who say a \"Rexit\" is possible before the end of the year, adding that Tillerson has been especially unhappy with President Trump's public criticism of attorney general Sessions. The story adds, however, that Tillerson might just have been \"venting.\" Tillerson had previously signaled that he intended to see through a restructuring of the State Department through 2017, but that now seems to be in doubt, reports Newsweek.

The speculation has been circulating for weeks now, notes US News & World Report, and it isn't helped by statements from Tillerson himself, who said in March that he \"didn't want this job.\" It's reached the point where Tillerson's spokesman addressed the subject, though in the form of a denial that his boss is on the way out.

Sources tell CNN and the Washington Post that Tillerson is so fed up with the White House that he's considering stepping down. The sources say the secretary of state has become so frustrated that he has come to realize that things won't change anytime soon and that there may be a \"Rexit\" coming. Tillerson has clashed with Trump before, including over the president's travel ban and his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but the Post's sources say this is the most serious",

And since he seems to be the Susan Lucci of the Grammys with 17 nominations, an zero wins, the Walk of Fame is a big deal. So when it came time for Snoop to recognize the person whose hard work and tenacity paved the way for the honor, naturally, the artist formerly known as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Snoop Lion gave thanks to the most important member of his squad: himself. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Snoop\u2019s been having a good year: His most recent album, Snoop Dogg Presents Bible Of Love, topped the gospel charts in March, and Redemption Of A Dogg, the semi-autobiographical musical that he\u2019s starring in, has just finished up its autumn tour.

    "document": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As the oil and gas industry has expanded in parts of the US, so have the number of earthquakes \n \n Massive injections of wastewater from the oil and gas industry are likely to have triggered a sharp rise in earthquakes in the state of Oklahoma. \n \n Researchers say there has been a forty-fold increase in the rate of quakes in the US state between 2008-13. \n \n The scientists found that the disposal of water in four high-volume wells could be responsible for a swarm of tremors up to 35km away. \n \n Their research has been published in the journal, Science. \n \n Sudden swarm \n \n There has been increasing evidence of links between the process of oil and gas extraction and earthquakes in states like Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Oklahoma in recent years. \n \n If a fault is close to failure, the amount that the pressure is going up at these locations in our model is enough to push them over the edge Dr Katie Keranen, Cornell University \n \n In 2011, a small number of people were injured and 14 houses were destroyed in the town of Prague, Oklahoma by a 5.7 tremor. \n \n Investigators linked it to the injection of wastewater from the oil industry. \n \n The US Geological Survey (USGS) has also reported on the question of seismicity induced by wastewater disposal. \n \n This new research goes further, linking a large swarm of Oklahoma tremors with a number of specific water wells, distantly located. \n \n More than 2,500 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 have occurred around the small town of Jones since 2008. This represents about 20% of the total in the central and western US in this period. \n \n Image copyright Cornell Image caption There has been a significant increase in the number of tremors in central Oklahoma since 2008 \n \n Researchers have now linked this increase to a near doubling in the volumes of wastewater disposed of in the central Oklahoma region between 2004 and 2008. \n \n Water is never far away in the energy extraction process. It is used not just for hydraulic fracturing, but also to squeeze more oil out of conventional wells. \n \n Large amounts of naturally occurring water are often released with the oil and gas - and this briny liquid needs to be separated from the fuels, using a method called \"dewatering\". \n \n \"There is a high ratio of water to oil,\" said the study's lead author Dr Katie Keranen from Cornell University. \n \n \"It differs for each well. The typical nationwide ratio is five to one. We're seeing much higher ratios, in the hundreds, at the beginning of the well.\" \n \n According to Dr Bill Ellsworth from the USGS, the high price of oil has driven this water-based approach. But the law says that drinking water has to be protected from the salty flow. \n \n \"As part of the business model, you have to be able to dispose of these very large volumes of saline water. You can't treat it; you can't put it into the rivers. So, you have to inject it underground.\" \n \n Pressure points \n \n Four of the biggest of these wells in Oklahoma have been pumping around 4 million barrels of water a month to a depth of 3.5km beneath the surface. \n \n To determine the impact of this water, the scientists developed a model that could calculate the way the underground wave of pressure from these wells spread out. \n \n By comparing this to seismic data from the Jones cluster, it was concluded that the injection of wastewater is \"likely responsible\" for the swarm. \n \n \"It is possible that pressure looks to have risen in the places where the earthquakes are occurring,\" said Dr Keranen. \n \n \"That pressure increase is what we see in natural triggering. So, if a fault is close to failure, the amount that the pressure is going up at these locations in our model is enough to push them over the edge.\" \n \n The four wells that are the subject of the study are owned by a company called New Dominion. It insists that it operates its wells (named Sweetheart, Chambers, Flower Power and Deep Throat) safely and within permitted parameters. \n \n \"The company notes the author did not consult with New Dominion's geologist and engineers to determine whether her premises are in any way correct,\" the company said in a statement. \n \n \"At best, these incorrect assumptions are irresponsible.\" \n \n Bigger triggers \n \n The authors say that they are uncertain about the potential for the large-scale disposal of wastewater to trigger events of larger magnitude. \n \n They point to an incident in 2010 when an earthquake ruptured a portion of a 7km long fault. If the entire fault had gone, the authors write, it could have led to a magnitude 6.0 tremor. \n \n \"We often see more larger earthquakes when we see a lot of smaller ones,\" said Dr Keranen. \n \n \"But this is new situation with induced seismicity and we still have a lot of questions that we are trying to address.\" \n \n This view is echoed by Dr Bill Ellsworth from USGS. \n \n \"There are thousands of these wells in the US, so only a few appear to be problematic. The difficulties can be avoided but we need to know more about the process so we can give proper guidance to the authorities.\" \n \n Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc. ||||| More than 230 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 3.0 have shaken the state of Oklahoma already this year. Before 2008 the state averaged one such quake a year. The surge in seismic activity has left residents and experts alike wondering about the underlying cause. \n \n \n \n Past research has shown that processes such as wastewater injection at oil drilling and fracking sites throughout the state could induce a small number of earthquakes but scientists have never been able to specifically link some of the more distant or stronger earthquakes with these sometimes faraway wastewater wells. That is, until now. \n \n \n \n A study published today in Science explains how wastewater injection sites\u2014areas where toxic water left over from oil drilling and fracking processes is injected into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting freshwater\u2014could be driving the sharp increase in the sometimes-disastrous earthquake events. \u201cIt really is unprecedented to have this many earthquakes over a broad region like this,\u201d says study co-author Geoffrey Abers of Cornell University. \u201cMost big sequences of earthquakes that we see are either a main shock and a lot of aftershocks or it might be right at the middle of a volcano in a volcanic system or geothermal system. So you might see little swarms but nothing really this distributed and this persistent.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Abers and his colleagues dug up data on the rates and volumes of liquids associated with the wastewater injection sites. They then modeled the flow of the water and calculated the physical properties of the rocks into which the water was injected. In so doing the team determined that a relatively small number of wastewater injection sites used in oil drilling and fracking in Oklahoma may have the ability after all to induce relatively strong earthquakes a long distance away, throughout the state. \u201cThe important thing is that we are seeing earthquakes that are much more widely distributed, much farther from wells and in a lot of different directions,\u201d Abers observes \u201cSome of these earthquakes are as much as 20 miles away from what seems to be the primary wells that are increasing the pressure.\u201d \n \n \n \n Scientists have known since the 1960s that wastewater injection, during which millions of barrels of wastewater are forced into a disposal well, can induce earthquakes by increasing the fluid pressures underground. That increasing pressure reduces the frictional strength of faults, Abers explains, allowing them to slip. \n \n \n \n Seismologist Austin Holland of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, who was not involved in the study, says there could be a large number of factors playing into the quakes. But like the authors of the new paper, he, too, has found evidence linking the Oklahoma quakes specifically to oil and gas activity. \u201cWe certainly do have a contribution from oil and gas, but the question is how much, how extensive is this and how is this occurring,\u201d he says. \u201cThis study will certainly help improve our understanding in the scientific discussion of what is occurring in Oklahoma.\u201d \n \n \n \n The number of wastewater injection sites also seems to keep increasing, according to Abers, who notes that the permitted rate of wastewater doubled between 2004 and 2008, and has most likely increased since then. He says several earthquakes in Texas over the past few years have been linked to wastewater injection but the scale of these events pales in comparison with what is happening in Oklahoma. There have also been well-documented cases of wastewater injection-driven quakes in Ohio, Utah, Colorado and British Columbia, all within the last year or so. \n \n \n \n Holland added that these events demand political and social discussion. \u201cJust how important is it to produce oil and gas in Oklahoma, and are we willing to deal with the issues of these disposal wells in order to produce the oil and gas that we are accustomed to producing?\u201d he asks. \n \n \n \n Abers notes that ongoing research on this topic will be needed to better understand the complexity of these processes as they continue into the future. \u201cI think this rate of earthquake increase in the midcontinent is really extraordinary and is continuing, but this isn\u2019t the last word on this in any means,\u201d Abers remarks. \u201cThere is clearly something important going on there that we need to keep an eye on and that we need to be trying to understand.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Earthquakes in Oklahoma are up more than a hundredfold in recent years, and a new study spies a pretty clear link between the shaking and the fracking that has given the state's economy a huge boost. Researchers took a close look at four specific sites where wastewater from oil and gas extraction was injected into the ground and found that the process could be linked to swarms of quakes in areas up to 20 miles away from the sites, reports the BBC. The four wells examined have been pumping four million barrels of water a month to a depth of around two miles underground. At one site linked to the wells, a small town called Jones, there have been more 2,500 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 since 2008\u2014a fifth of the total in the central and western US during that period. \"It really is unprecedented to have this many earthquakes over a broad region like this,\" a study co-author tells Scientific American, explaining that wastewater injection can cause quakes by sending out waves of fluid pressure, causing faults miles away to slip. \"Most big sequences of earthquakes that we see are either a main shock and a lot of aftershocks or it might be right at the middle of a volcano in a volcanic system or geothermal system. So you might see little swarms but nothing really this distributed and this persistent,\" he says. (In Texas, several small towns troubled by quakes are considering banning fracking.)",

    "document": "Photo \n \n With 1.39 billion active users worldwide, Facebook\u2019s social network is the closest thing we have to a universal communication platform. And people post \u2014 or try to post \u2014 just about everything you can imagine. \n \n On Monday, the company clarified its community standards to give its users more guidance about what types of posts are not allowed on the service. \n \n Facebook walks a delicate line when it tries to ban violent or offensive content without suppressing the free sharing of information that it says it wants to encourage. Its audience is vast, with a huge variance in age, cultural values and laws across the globe. Yet despite its published guidelines, the reasoning behind Facebook\u2019s decisions to block or allow content are often opaque and inconsistent. \n \n For example, the company flip-flopped repeatedly on whether to allow beheading videos on the service before recently deciding to ban them. In December, it blocked a page in Russia that was promoting an antigovernment protest, then allowed copycat pages to stay up. And in October, it created an exception to its requirement that people use their real names on the service when it allowed San Francisco\u2019s drag queens to use their stage names while continuing to crack down on others using false names. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to strike the balance based on the way our community works,\u201d Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, said in an interview. \u201cThe landscape is complicated.\u201d \n \n The company hopes that more specific explanation of its rules will take some of the mystery out of what it will and will not allow. \n \n Terrorist organizations like the Islamic State have long been banned from the service. But supporting or praising groups involved in \u201cviolent, criminal or hateful behavior\u201d is also banned, the updated rules say. \n \n Threatening people with physical or financial harm, or bullying them by posting items intended to degrade or shame them, is also prohibited. So is anything that encourages suicide or eating disorders. \n \n Facebook has always banned pornography and most other nudity, but it is now diving into the nuances. \u201cWe remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks,\u201d it says. It also restricts some images of female breasts if the nipple shows, \u201cbut we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breast-feeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring.\u201d Photos of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures are also fine. \n \n The company is for the first time explicitly banning content promoting sexual violence or exploitation, including so-called revenge porn, which it defines as intimate images \u201cshared in revenge or without permission from the people in the images.\u201d (Twitter has also updated its rules to forbid revenge porn.) \n \n One thing that has not changed: Facebook has no plans to automatically scan for and remove potentially offensive content, Ms. Bickert said. \n \n Facebook will still rely on users to report violations of the standards. Ms. Bickert said that the company had review teams working at all hours of the day around the globe, and that every report was examined by one of them before a decision was made. \n \n The process can take time \u2014 typically 48 hours on matters of safety, she said. That may not be fast enough for some people in an era where graphic content can go viral in minutes. Twitter, which is a much more public forum, has come under fire from women\u2019s advocates and antiterror groups for not responding quickly enough to reports of abusive or violent tweets. \n \n But Facebook wants to take into account the full context of a post, Ms. Bickert said. For example, a victim of a violent attack might post images on Facebook as a way of raising public awareness. \u201cSometimes the best way to share information about atrocities in the world is Facebook,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognize that is a very challenging issue.\u201d \n \n Facebook\u2019s rulings can also be appealed. \u201cIf a person\u2019s account is suspended, those appeals are read by real people who can look into the specifics,\u201d she said. \n \n Ms. Bickert said that clarifying its rules helped not only Facebook users but also the people who reviewed possible violations to decide what was permissible. \u201cWe can only do this if we have objective rules,\u201d she said. \n \n Governments also ask Facebook to take down posts. In conjunction with the updated community standards, the company published on Monday its latest transparency report, which discloses country-by-country information on government requests for user data and the removal of content. \n \n In the report, Facebook says that in the second half of 2014, it restricted 9,707 pieces of content for violating local laws, up 11 percent from the first half of the year. Of those, India requested the most takedowns, with 5,832, and Turkey was not far behind with 3,624. No content was restricted in the United States based on government requests. \n \n The number of government requests for account data increased slightly, to 35,051, compared with 34,946 in the first half. The United States was at the top of the list, making 14,274 requests for information on 21,731 Facebook accounts, with the company agreeing to turn over information in 79 percent of the cases. \n \n \u201cAs difficult questions arise about the limits of what people can share, we have a single guiding principle: We want to give the most voice to the most people,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, wrote in a post that accompanied the report. \n \n \u201cSome people say we should ignore government orders requiring us to restrict people\u2019s voice, even if that means the whole service would be blocked in those countries. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we have a responsibility to the millions of people in these countries who rely on Facebook to stay in touch with their friends and family every day. If we ignored a lawful government order and then we were blocked, all of these people\u2019s voices would be muted, and whatever content the government believed was illegal would be blocked anyway.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to think of free expression and having a voice as black and white \u2014 either you have it or you don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut giving people a voice, like most things in our society, is something that we must make incremental progress towards.\u201d ||||| By Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management, and Chris Sonderby, Deputy General Counsel \n \n Every day, people around the world use Facebook to connect with family and friends, share information and express themselves. The conversations that happen here mirror the diversity of the more than one billion people who use Facebook, with people discussing everything from pets to politics. Our goal is to give people a place to share and connect freely and openly, in a safe and secure environment. \n \n We have a set of Community Standards that are designed to help people understand what is acceptable to share on Facebook. These standards are designed to create an environment where people feel motivated and empowered to treat each other with empathy and respect. \n \n Today we are providing more detail and clarity on what is and is not allowed. For example, what exactly do we mean by nudity, or what do we mean by hate speech? While our policies and standards themselves are not changing, we have heard from people that it would be helpful to provide more clarity and examples, so we are doing so with today\u2019s update. \n \n There are also times when we may have to remove or restrict access to content because it violates a law in a particular country, even though it doesn\u2019t violate our Community Standards. We report the number of government requests to restrict content for contravening local law in our Global Government Requests Report, which we are also releasing today. We challenge requests that appear to be unreasonable or overbroad. And if a country requests that we remove content because it is illegal in that country, we will not necessarily remove it from Facebook entirely, but may restrict access to it in the country where it is illegal. \n \n Billions of pieces of content are shared on Facebook every day. We hope these two updates help provide more clarity about the standards we have, whether they are our own Community Standards or those imposed by different laws around the world. \n \n More Detailed Community Standards \n \n The updated Community Standards are broken into four sections: \n \n Helping to keep you safe \n \n Encouraging respectful behavior \n \n Keeping your account and personal information secure \n \n Protecting your intellectual property \n \n In particular, we\u2019ve provided more guidance on policies related to self-injury, dangerous organizations, bullying and harassment, criminal activity, sexual violence and exploitation, nudity, hate speech, and violence and graphic content. While some of this guidance is new, it is consistent with how we\u2019ve applied our standards in the past. \n \n It\u2019s a challenge to maintain one set of standards that meets the needs of a diverse global community. For one thing, people from different backgrounds may have different ideas about what\u2019s appropriate to share \u2014 a video posted as a joke by one person might be upsetting to someone else, but it may not violate our standards. \n \n This is particularly challenging for issues such as hate speech. Hate speech has always been banned on Facebook, and in our new Community Standards, we explain our efforts to keep our community free from this kind of abusive language. We understand that many countries have concerns about hate speech in their communities, so we regularly talk to governments, community members, academics and other experts from around the globe to ensure that we are in the best position possible to recognize and remove such speech from our community. We know that our policies won\u2019t perfectly address every piece of content, especially where we have limited context, but we evaluate reported content seriously and do our best to get it right. \n \n If people believe Pages, profiles or individual pieces of content violate our Community Standards, they can report it to us by clicking the \u201cReport\u201d link at the top, right-hand corner. Our reviewers look to the person reporting the content for information about why they think the content violates our standards. People can also unfollow, block or hide content and people they don\u2019t want to see, or reach out to people who post things that they don\u2019t like or disagree with. \n \n While the Community Standards outline Facebook\u2019s expectations when it comes to what content is or is not acceptable in our community, countries have local laws that prohibit some forms of content. In some countries, for example, it is against the law to share content regarded as being blasphemous. While blasphemy is not a violation of the Community Standards, we will still evaluate the reported content and restrict it in that country if we conclude it violates local law. \n \n Countries contact us to let us know when content may be in violation of local laws and we compile these requests into a public report called the Global Government Requests Report. \n \n Global Government Requests Report \n \n The Global Government Requests Report, which covers the second half of 2014, includes information about the government requests we received for content removal and account data as well as national security requests under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and through National Security Letters. \n \n Overall, we continue to see an increase in government requests for data and content restrictions. The amount of content restricted for violating local law increased by 11% over the previous half, to 9,707 pieces of content restricted, up from 8,774. We saw a rise in content restriction requests from countries like Turkey and Russia, and declines in places like Pakistan. \n \n The number of government requests for account data remained relatively flat, with a slight increase to 35,051 from 34,946. There was an increase in data requests from certain governments such as India, and decline in requests from countries such as the United States and Germany. \n \n We publish this information because we want people to know the extent and nature of the requests we receive from governments and the policies we have in place to process them. \n \n Moving forward, we will continue to scrutinize each government request and push back when we find deficiencies. We will also continue to push governments around the world to reform their surveillance practices in a way that maintains the safety and security of their people while ensuring their rights and freedoms are protected. ||||| This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Rather than electronically identifying offensive images, for instance, the company says it has actual human beings assess context, the New York Times reports. Today, the site is posting a more thorough explanation of its policies, which also address matters ranging from hate speech and nudity to issues of intellectual property. It encourages users to flag content that concerns them. Among its examples: Nudity: Genitals are a no-no. But while, for example, some images of breasts won't be tolerated, pictures of breastfeeding or mastectomy scars are allowed, as is artwork showing nudes, a spokeswoman tells the paper. Violence: The site has gone back and forth on beheading videos, finally settling on a ban, the Times reports. But images of violence may be allowed if they're aimed at sharing \"information about atrocities in the world.\" Hate speech: Race-, gender-, and religion-based attacks won't be tolerated, the site says. But \"people can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and practices,\" the site notes. \"Such discussion can promote debate and greater understanding.\" International differences: The laws of different countries can change what's acceptable where.

    "document": "CLOSE Actor Tom Sizemore is accused of touching an 11-year-old girl\u2019s genitals, while filming a movie in 2003. Buzz60 \n \n 'The Hollywood Reporter' says actor Tom Sizemore, seen here in 2014, was suspended from the 2003 film 'Born Killers' after he allegedly violated an 11-year-old girl. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Invision/AP) \n \n Another week, another ugly allegation of sexual assault against a Hollywood star, this time tough-guy actor Tom Sizemore who is accused of sexually molesting an 11-year-old actress on a movie set in 2003. \n \n The Hollywood Reporter posted a story late Monday recounting how Sizemore, then 42, allegedly was told to leave the Utah set of a crime thriller called Born Killers (shot as Piggy Banks) after the child actress told her mother that Sizemore had touched her genitals during a photo shoot for the film. \n \n But her parents declined to press charges and months later, Sizemore returned for reshoots in Malibu. THR said the story was based on interviews with a dozen people involved with the production who confirmed that Sizemore was sent home over the alleged incident, and that it provoked anger and tensions on the set. \n \n Sizemore, 55, already notorious in Hollywood for his drug use and convictions for battery against women, has never been accused of molestation before. \n \n He is best known for his roles in action films and dramas, especially Saving Private Ryan in 1998 and Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor in 2001. Despite his rap sheet, he has worked steadily; his IMDb page lists 15 projects in 2018 alone. \n \n This incident has previously gone unreported, THR reported, but is coming out now in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment-and-rape scandal, which has set off a cascade of similar allegations and a belated industry move towards openness about such accusations. \n \n USA TODAY reached out to Sizemore's representatives but has received no response. His agent, Stephen Rice, told the industry trade paper, \"Our position is 'no comment.'\" \n \n Charles Lago of DTLA Entertainment Group, who was Sizemore's former manager for a half-dozen years until Lago dropped him in disgust after he was accused of beating women, said he was \"not surprised\" by the allegation. He blamed Sizemore's behavior on frequent drug use. \n \n \"He's the most abhorrent person I've ever met in my life,\" Lago said, although this alleged incident happened before he worked with Sizemore. \"I heard something happened on the set but I didn't realize it involved a child. It was hushed up.\" \n \n The young actress, now 26, was unidentified at her request; she told THR she didn't want to talk about the matter except to say that she's recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents. \n \n THR reported Sizemore is said to have denied the young actress' claim as soon as he was confronted with it; shortly after, he was quietly dropped by his management firm and talent agency. \n \n The promotional photo session required the child, who had a small role in the film, to be seated on Sizemore's lap for a holiday picture. \n \n \"This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside,\" THR reported. The paper quoted production manager Cassidy Lunnen recalling that the \"the girl was so young it was unclear to her and (later) her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not.\" \n \n The paper also interviewed Robyn Adamson, who portrayed the wife in the film, who stood near the photographer when the picture was being taken. She recalled the child, who was wearing a flannel nightgown, reacted to something during the photoshoot. \n \n \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited,\" Adamson told the paper. \"I was watching her. She soon reintegrated and kept going, although she had trouble taking direction. Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" \n \n When casting director Catrine McGregor heard about the alleged encounter from the child's agent, she filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild legal department and pushed for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project. (SAG declined to comment to THR.) \n \n The paper also talked to a production assistant, Roi Maufas, who said the crew believed what the child said because they considered Sizemore a \"sleazebag.\" \n \n \"There was never any doubt,\" Maufas said. \"He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high.

We considered whether we had some responsibility to him to not pass judgment on him.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2AEiA7M ||||| A dozen cast and crewmembers tell THR that the actor was sent home after the girl told her parents about the incident. \n \n Actor Tom Sizemore was told to leave a Utah film set in 2003 after an 11-year-old actress told her mother that he had touched her genitals, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Months later, he returned for reshoots in Malibu after her parents declined to press charges. The incident has never been revealed publicly. \n \n When contacted, the now 26-year-old former actress, whom THR is not identifying at her request, declined to address the matter except to note that she's recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents. Sizemore declined to address the situation. \"Our position is 'no comment,'\" says his agent Stephen Rice. \n \n THR spoke to a dozen people involved with the production of the film, a crime thriller called Born Killers (shot as Piggy Banks). They confirmed Sizemore was sent home over the alleged incident. According to these cast- and crewmembers, rumors swirled and emotions rose on set over what had allegedly transpired. \n \n Sizemore, notorious for his long rap sheet that includes charges of drug use and battery against women, has not previously been accused of molestation. An actor with a tough-guy image then at the height of his scandal-driven infamy, when the Utah incident occurred he'd recently been convicted of physically abusing and harassing his ex-girlfriend, the former \"Hollywood Madam\" Heidi Fleiss. \n \n Sizemore is said to have denied the young actress' claim as soon as he was confronted with it. His management firm Untitled and talent agency CAA quietly dropped him shortly afterward. He's currently repped by the boutique firm Pantheon. \n \n \u200bCast- and crewmembers, inspired by the nascent movement toward industry transparency in the post-Harvey Weinstein era, explain that the incident took place near the end of production on Born Killers (not to be confused with Oliver Stone's earlier Natural Born Killers, which Sizemore also appeared in). It was during a second-unit still portrait session, to capture photos of Sizemore's character with his abandoned wife and daughter. The imagery would serve as a plot device in the $5 million film, which was released by Lionsgate in 2005. The film centers on two immoral brothers on a crime spree. (Sizemore played the dissolute father who raised them.) \n \n \u200bThe roughly half-hour session required the young actress, who had a small role in the production, to be seated on Sizemore's lap in a holiday tableau. This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside. Production manager Cassidy Lunnen recalls that \"the girl was so young it was unclear to her and [later] her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not.\" \n \n During one setup, which required just the two of them, Robyn Adamson, who portrayed the wife, stood away, near the photographer. She recalls of the girl, who was wearing a flannel nightgown: \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited. I was watching her. She soon reintegrated and kept going, although she had trouble taking direction. Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" \n \n Catrine McGregor, the casting director who hired the young actress, fielded a call from the actress' agent the next day, explaining that the girl had informed her mother that she'd been inappropriately touched. \"The mother noticed that her daughter was unusually quiet and told her she was going to take her to this swimming place that was the little girl's favorite thing,\" says McGregor, a four-decade veteran in the business, who notes that she subsequently filed a complaint with SAG's legal department and advocated for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project. (SAG declined to comment.) \"When the girl put on her bathing suit, she told her mother that it reminded her of the day before, in an upsetting way \u2014 that the bathing suit's contact against her felt like what happened when the man had put his finger inside her,\" as McGregor understood the events on-set. \n \n Word spread quickly. \"It filtered down to the crew,\" says Roi Maufas, who worked as a production assistant. \"The little girl said what she said and we all thought, 'That fucking sleazebag.' There was never any doubt. He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high. We're talking about consistent behavior, just being 'Tom Sizemore' on set every day. Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers. [Producer James R. Rosenthal, who died in 2011], who was livid himself, had to stop a group of us from going to visit Mr. Sizemore to kick the guy's ass.\" \n \n In interviews, the film's producers Jai Stefan, Michael Manshel and Gus Spoliansky note that they removed Sizemore from set as soon as they heard about the assertion, reviewed the photographs from the portrait session but found them to be inconclusive evidence and sought out the parents to encourage them to engage law enforcement if they felt compelled to do so. Stefan, who along with the others describes being heavily affected by the actress' claim (\"I was like, 'Did that just happen on my watch?' I started crying\"), recalls the parents \"not wanting the little girl being taken off the movie. We said we can remove her, remove him, remove both.\" \n \n \"They did talk to the police but didn't press charges,\" says Manshel adding: \"We also talked to Tom at the time, and told him everything that had been told to us, and he said: 'I've done a lot of awful things, and I'd never do anything with kids.' We considered whether we had some responsibility to him to not pass judgment on him.\" \n \n Eventually, in need of pick-up shots, they invited Sizemore to Spoliansky's Malibu home a couple of months later for reshoots. \n \n \"We had a fiduciary responsibility to complete the film so we decided to go about business as usual \u2014 lacking the evidence of what happened that day,\" says Spoliansky. Still, he's quick to add, \"We took the allegation extremely seriously and we were willing to do anything, including dismissing Tom. We just couldn't be police, judge and jury.\" \n \n McGregor, the first to come forward to THR about the episode, speculates that the girl's parents may not have wanted to compound professional harm with emotional harm, observing that they \"didn't want to possibly ruin their daughter's film career.\" \n \n \u200bSizemore, 55, gained renown in the 1990s for a series of tough-guy supporting roles in primarily action films and dramas, including Point Break, True Romance, Strange Days and Wyatt Earp, leading to his biggest career moments with Saving Private Ryan in 1998 and Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor in 2001. (In 2000 he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his acting in the HBO movie Witness Protection.) \n \n \u200bAfter the Born Killers shoot, and in the midst of becoming a father (to twin boys in 2005), Sizemore continued to work steadily, although relegated to smaller roles on less prestigious projects. More recently, though, his career has picked up again, particularly on TV, with notable arcs on USA's Shooter and Showtime's revival of Twin Peaks. In September, he appeared opposite Liam Neeson in Felt, playing an FBI rival of the Deep Throat source in the Watergate drama. At press time, according to IMDb, he's attached to, and frequently listed as starring in, more than three dozen often low-budget and genre independent film projects in some stage of development or production. \n \n Sizemore has long publicly contended with a drug addiction that dates to his teens. (Among other troubles, Bakersfield police charged him with possession of methamphetamine in 2007, and three years later he appeared on Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew.) He also has a history of alleged aggressive behavior toward women, most recently in February, pleading no contest to two misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse for assaulting his girlfriend in July 2016 in downtown L.A. This followed two previous arrests for suspected battery of another woman in 2009 and 2011, and before that his Fleiss conviction in Los Angeles court in August 2003 \u2014 the same month that production began on Born Killers. He'd eventually be sentenced to half a year in prison for the Fleiss matter. \n \n \"I remember being excited that he went to jail,\" says Jennie Latham, a second assistant director on the film, \"even if it was for something else.\"",

After two days of climbing, the climbers were approximately 1,000 feet below the summit. In mid-afternoon, the lead climber sustained a fall that was not life threatening. However, during the fall, a secondary rope became wrapped around his right thumb, severing the appendage clean from the hand. The severed thumb miraculously fell approximately 80 feet and landed on a two foot by one foot ledge. The climbing partner was able to retrieve the thumb and the pair called the Yosemite National Park Emergency Communication Center seeking emergency assistance. \n \n \n \n At 3:50 p.m., the park's contract helicopter, piloted by Richard Shatto, along with Helitec Crewmembers Jeff Pirog and Eric Small, and Yosemite Park Rangers Jeff Webb and Dave Pope, flew from Yosemite Valley to assess the situation. Although the weather was favorable with light winds, impending darkness was an issue and Incident Commander, Yosemite Valley District Ranger Eric Gabriel, made the decision to attempt to extract the climber via short-haul. This is a technique where Park Rangers are suspended from a rope below the helicopter to remove the climber from the wall. Gabriel, who had consulted with the park's medical clinic, knew of the short window of time in which the thumb could successfully be reattached and felt the complex mission was worth pursuing. The helicopter hovered near the climbers and Park Rangers Webb and Pope were successfully short-hauled to the injured party. Once on the wall, the injured climber was transported back to El Capitan Meadow via helicopter. On the ground, the climber was transferred to another air medical helicopter to be flown out of the park. Webb remained with the partner overnight and was raised approximately 1,000 feet the following day to the summit using traditional rock-rescue technique. \n \n \n \n Later that evening, the injured climber underwent surgery at the California Pacific Medical Center, Davies Campus, in San Francisco, where his thumb was successfully reattached. \n \n \n \n \"This was an incredibly technical and complex rescue mission with a lot of inherent risk. However, knowing that the thumb could be reattached, coupled with the confidence I have in my team, I made the decision to attempt this rescue. I was relieved, and thrilled, that this ended successfully and we were able to make a positive difference in this person's life,\" stated Gabriel. \n \n \n \n Yosemite National Park Search and Rescue conducts hundreds of rescues each year.

Details of how and when he got into the country were not immediately clear. \n \n In his comments to reporters, Martinez strongly criticized the U.S. for alleged human rights violations. \n \n Martinez's mother, Patricia Eugenia Martinez of El Paso, told CNN that her son was bipolar and earlier had tried to enter North Korea by swimming across a river, but was stopped and shipped back to the United States, where he was placed in a California psychiatric hospital. \n \n \"Then he got out,\" she told the network. \"He is very smart and he got the court to let him out, and instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for China.

It is also used for signing ceremonies between North Korea and other countries. \n \n His comments came amid North Korea's own loud protests of a resolution in the United Nations that could open the door for its leaders to face charges of crimes against humanity for human rights violations, raising questions of whether Martinez was trotted out to the media for propaganda purposes. \n \n North Korea recently released three Americans \u2014 two who had entered the country on tourist visas and Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who had been convicted of \"anti-state\" crimes. ||||| Story highlights The man is identified as Arturo Pierre Martinez, 29, of El Paso, Texas \n \n His mother says her son is bipolar and has been in a psychiatric hospital \n \n In a statement, he says he crossed illegally into North Korea \n \n He denounces the American political and economic system in the statement \n \n An American who said he crossed illegally into North Korea denounced the United States political and economic system Sunday morning at a press conference in that country. \n \n The man said he was Arturo Pierre Martinez, 29, a U.S. citizen raised in El Paso, Texas. \n \n Martinez's mother, Patricia Eugenia Martinez of El Paso, said their son was bipolar and earlier tried to enter North Korea by swimming across a river, only to be stopped and shipped back to the United States, where he was placed in a California psychiatric hospital. \n \n \"Then he got out,\" she said. \"He is very smart and he got the court to let him out and instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for China.

I am appreciative to the North Korean authorities for pardoning my son and releasing him. I look forward to spending Christmas with him after they release him.\" \n \n When asked how she knew her son was being released, she said it was from reading the press conference statement. \n \n But the legal status of Martinez in North Korea is unclear and it's unknown if he's free to leave the country. \n \n In his 4,000-word statement, Martinez admitted committing a crime by illegally entering the country but said he was \"extremely grateful for having been pardoned from the punishments given to violators of these laws, and for the most generous reception I have received.\" \n \n He delivered his statement at a press conference he said he requested. Images released by North Korea showed him wearing a suit and sitting in a room facing a large group of people. \n \n North Korea said in a separate statement that Martinez entered the country in November, two days after American diplomat James Clapper arrived. Clapper negotiated the release of Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two American citizens known to be held by North Korea. They arrived back in the United States on November 8. \n \n Martinez said he first tried to cross over from South Korea's Han River and tried again from China's Yalu River in Dandong. \n \n He went on to criticize American politicians and police as well as the electoral and prison systems. \n \n \"The illegal war carried out against the nation of Iraq serves as a perfect example of how the U.S. government acts much like a Mafia enterprise, but criminally plundering entire nations of their resources, strategic reserves and economies instead of smaller scale business and individuals, and does so without a code of ethics,\" he said. \n \n He said the electoral system in the United States \"is unfairly built for the benefit of the wealthy through the necessity of costly fundraising for political candidates seeking office. The democracy of this nation is an illusion and its representatives act as nothing more than power brokers for those who can offer them.\" \n \n Of the wealthy people in the United States, he said, \"These billionaires in power are nothing short of sociopathic megalomaniacs on the path to absolute world domination.\" \n \n He also talked about unidentified flying objects, CIA involvement in the cocaine trade, \"ultrasonic\" devices that cause people to hear voices and experience bodily discomfort and how the Western news media unfairly portrayed North Korea.",

    "document": "Brendan McDermid/Reuters \n \n An $8 billion exchange merger is in the works that underscores how the global market for derivatives has eclipsed that for stocks. \n \n The owner of the venerable New York Stock Exchange is in talks to be acquired by an upstart commodities and derivatives trading platform, according to people briefed on the matter. The IntercontinentalExchange is expected to offer about $33 a share, with two-thirds of that in stock, one of these people said. That represents a premium of 37 percent to NYSE Euronext\u2019s closing stock price on Wednesday. \n \n A deal could be announced as soon as Thursday morning, though these people cautioned that talks may still break down. \n \n Article Tools \n \n While the New York Stock Exchange, with its opening bell and floor traders, has been the public image of a stock market for two centuries, it is NYSE Euronext\u2019s businesses in the over-the-counter trading of derivatives \u2014 including the Liffe market in London \u2014 that appear to be the main attraction in the merger talks. \n \n IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, was founded in 2000 and is based in Atlanta. It competes fiercely with the CME Group, a derivatives trading powerhouse that owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. \n \n More than a year ago, ICE teamed up with the New York exchange\u2019s chief rival, the Nasdaq OMX Group, to make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext. The two had sought to break up their older competitor\u2019s plan to merge with Deutsche B\u00f6rse of Europe, which would have created a powerful trans-Atlantic company with a big market share in the trading of stocks and derivatives. \n \n Under the terms of that deal, valued at about $11 billion, Nasdaq would have taken NYSE Euronext\u2019s equities business, while ICE would have assumed the derivatives operations. \n \n But the Justice Department threatened to block that joint offer, on the ground that combining NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq would create an overwhelming monopoly in the world of stock trading. \n \n The planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche B\u00f6rse itself fell apart early this year after European antitrust regulators opposed the combination, on the ground that it would corner too much of the market in exchange-traded derivatives. \n \n But the newest merger might pose fewer problems because ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives. \n \n And unlike several proposed mergers, like that of the Singaporean and Australian stock exchanges, which fell apart last year on nationalist concerns, this potential deal would take place between two companies from the same country. \n \n After its deal with Deutsche B\u00f6rse collapsed, NYSE Euronext was left to conduct some soul-searching. At the time, the company said that it would most likely look to smaller acquisitions and cost-cutting. \n \n The trading of stocks has become a less attractive business. The New York Stock Exchange is now responsible for only about 11 percent of all stock trading, while NYSE Euronext\u2019s electronic Arca platform accounts for another 12 percent, according to industry data. \n \n The average number of American stocks traded each day has fallen every year since 2009, and has continued to decline over the course of 2012, according to statistics from Credit Suisse. The volume of trading in futures and options, where ICE is focused, has also fallen since last year, but less than in stocks. \n \n A tie-up with ICE, however, would link NYSE Euronext to one of the industry\u2019s fastest-growing exchanges. ICE has some of the highest profit margins in the business. \n \n It might also reap some of the benefits that have driven a decade-long spree of consolidation among exchanges. Such companies have long sought to gain the greater scale and cost savings that come from combining back-end operations and staff cuts. \n \n Still, the potential merger would sharply expand ICE, which despite its bigger market value is a smaller company. It has a little more than 1,000 employees, while NYSE Euronext has 3,077. \n \n It isn\u2019t clear whether other exchanges would seek to break up the proposed transaction. The CME Group is a candidate to express opposition. But the firm appeared to have little appetite in bidding for NYSE Euronext last year, and it may run into antitrust concerns. \n \n Other potential spoilers, including the Hong Kong and Singaporean exchanges, could run into nationalist concerns. \n \n Shares of NYSE Euronext rose more than 21 percent in after-hours trading, to $29.20, after The Wall Street Journal reported news of the talks. \n \n Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting. ||||| Article Excerpt \n \n The New York Stock Exchange, the cornerstone of American capitalism for 220 years, agreed to be sold as part of an $8.2 billion takeover by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. \n \n If regulators and shareholders approve, the combined company would own 14 stock and futures exchanges and five clearing operations that serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers of futures and other contracts, doing more things in more places than any other rival. \n \n The takeover also would seal the triumph of electronic trading over \"open outcry\" floor trading that long dominated financial markets, as well as the push by exchanges to embrace new and ...",

But it\u2019s life,\u201d Mansour wrote. \u201cEven Thatcher was never able to disown her screw up son Mark. It\u2019s a Mom thing.\u201d \n \n A Palin spokesman declined to comment on Mansour. Her current status within the organization is unknown. \n \n Mansour came to SarahPAC after founding a pro-Palin fan site that attracted the former governor\u2019s attention. Mansour was hired as a policy adviser and speechwriter, but quickly transitioned to the role as Palin\u2019s lead spokesman and representative to the press. \n \n Mansour frequently responded harshly over Twitter to any negative story or comment about Palin, but was often much less direct in phone conversations. Mansour\u2019s public role, however, has noticeably diminished in recent weeks. She did not make any statement about the story over Twitter, until now her preferred form of communication. \n \n Mansour is also quoted in the story calling RedState founder Erick Erickson a \u201ctotal douchebag\u201d after the conservative blogger and activists attended a rally with Palin and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley last year. \u201cGreasy dumb ass with a talent for self-promotion. He threw himself in at the Gov\u2019s SC rally. Self-promotion,\u201d she wrote. \n \n Erickson responded via a post on RedState by saying that Mansour likely didn\u2019t know he had been asked to attend by Haley\u2019s staff. \n \n In addition to the damaging Tweets, the Daily Caller reported that Mansour initially denied that she had sent the messages to the unnamed source, claiming they had been doctored. \u201cI did actually send him one direct message. He was asking for \u2013 it was like something really innocuous \u2013 he was just asking for information about something,\u201d she tried to explain. \u201cAnd I just replied and said, \u2018no\u2019 or something like that. And then the kid then used that and started to create direct messages. And that was like a real serious thing for me because I realized anyone can do that with like a screencap.\u201d \n \n If Mansour has been let go by SarahPAC, there is unlikely to be any announcement for some time. Staff changes and reshuffles in Palin\u2019s camp are typically announced quietly only weeks or months after the fact. Or Palin watchers might have to wait for an answer until the PAC\u2019s next FEC report to see if the aide is still being paid. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

She did it in one leap. He didn't see her coming,\" Lola Chambers said. \n \n Eyewitnesses and Hayward police said people on stage subdued Andrews Potter after she allegedly shoved Chambers. Though the police investigation into a motive continues, family members believe the attack was racially motivated and was a result of Chambers' mention of Martin. The family is pressing police to file hate crime charges. Andrews Potter is white, they said. Chambers is black. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Hayward police took Andrews Potter to the police station, where she was arrested on suspicion of battery. She was cited and released, and could face additional charges in the coming days, according to Hayward police Lt. Ruben Pola. \n \n Chambers, a Petaluma resident, was taken to the hospital but has since been released, and is using a cane to walk. A photo his son posted on Facebook shows a large welt on his backside. His son said Chambers had a \"bruised rib muscle and nerve damage and he is sore all over.\" \n \n Chambers was a member of the 1960s soul group Chambers Brothers and has had a well-publicized fight with record executives over decades of royalty payments he said he has never received. \n \n The Chambers Brothers will be part of the inaugural class inducted into the R&B Hall of Fame later this year, Lola Chambers said. \n \n David DeBolt covers breaking news.

He is on the way to the hospital now.\u201d \n \n Kurt Crowbar Kangas, a musician and friend of Lester\u2019s, later posted in the comments thread: \n \n Lester is fine, just a bit sore and he will feel it tomorrow, the woman who attacked him was white and yelled something like \u201cit\u2019s all your fault\u201d before she hit him, he went down hard but was halfway caught by Barren, thank God, she was subdued by Police and taken away while the para-medics came and took him to a local Hospital where he went thru a series of cat scans, no broken bones, the only injury for now is a 8\u2033 scratch in the kidney area of his back and it\u2019s starting to swell. Thank you for all your well wishes, he will be up and running soon. \n \n Lester apparently dedicated the classic song, \u201cPeople Get Ready,\u201d by The Impressions to Martin. The woman heard the dedication and attacked him. \n \n His son posted a photo of Lester\u2019s injury to Facebook. He said he had a \u201cbruised rib and nerve damage\u201d and was \u201csore all over.\u201d \n \n There was a lot of talk, particularly by Zimmerman supporters, about how there would be riots if Zimmerman was acquitted. So far, all that we know happened that was violent was this attack and an attack on peaceful protesters by the Los Angeles police, who fired rubber bullets at them. \n \n Over fourteen months ago, Lester posted an \u201cI Am the 99%\u201d photo. The Occupy movement was still making headlines and a sign he held up read: \n \n I am the former lead singer of a 60\u2032s band. I performed before thousands at Atlanta Pop 2, Miami Pop, Newport Pop, Atlantic Pop. I did not squander my money on drugs or a fancy home. I went from 1967-1994 before I saw my first royalty check. The music giants I recorded with only paid me for 7 of my albums. I have never seen a penny in royalties from my other 10 albums I recorded. Our hit song was licensed to over 100 films, TV and commercials without our permission. One major TV network used our song for a national commercial and my payment was $625 dollars. I am now 72, trying to live on $1200 a month. Sweet Relief, a music charity is taking donations for me. Only the 1% of Artist can afford to sue. I am the 99%. \n \n He told VICE in an interview in May 2012 other musicians were in \u201cthe same boat\u201d as him. \n \n \u201cThere are so many. And so many different members of different bands. There are a lot of cases where two or three members did well and two or three didn\u2019t. So many, I can\u2019t begin to give you names,\u201d Lester said. \n \n The good news is that Lester has recorded a new album after raising over $69,000 with a Kickstarter project. It is an opportunity for the \u201cinternet public\u201d to right a wrong committed by the music industry. \n \n \u201cPeople Get Ready\u201d is a song that The Chambers Brothers recorded for their album \u201cThe Time Has Come\u201d in 1967 (which included a version of the group\u2019s most well-known song, \u201cTime Has Come Today\u201d). \n \n The song reflected the times. Written by the late great musician Curtis Mayfield, \u201cPeople Get Ready\u201d was written after Martin Luther King Jr. led the March on Washington, and it resonated with those fighting racial injustice and oppression because of the universal gospel message that, if people continued to persist in their struggle, they could prevail. \n \n As the song goes: \n \n People get ready, there\u2019s a train a-comin\u2019 You don\u2019t need no baggage, you just get on board All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin\u2019 Don\u2019t need no ticket, you just thank the Lord \n \n It is an incredibly appropriate song to dedicate to Trayvon. There may be no punishment for what George Zimmerman did when he killed Trayvon, but don\u2019t let this be demoralizing. Keep on fighting. Challenge the law that gives self-appointed vigilante neighborhood watchmen the cover to claim self-defense after profiling a young black teenager and escape having to serve serious time in jail. \n \n Here\u2019s Lester Chambers performing \u201cPeople Get Ready\u201d earlier this year:",

REUTERS/Saudi Press Agency/Handout via Reuters \n \n Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the world\u2019s top oil exporter expects state oil company Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL] to be valued at more than $2 trillion ahead of the sale of less than 5 percent of it through an initial public offering (IPO). \n \n He added that the kingdom would raise the capital of its public investment fund to 7 trillion riyals ($2 trillion) from 600 billion riyals ($160 billion). \n \n The plans also included changes that would alter the social structure of the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom by pushing for women to have a bigger economic role and by offering improved status to resident expatriates. \n \n \u201cWe will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets,\u201d Prince Mohammed said at his first news conference with international journalists, who were invited to a Riyadh palace for the event. \n \n \u201cWe have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he had earlier told al-Arabiya television news channel. \n \n His \u201cVision 2030\u201d envisaged raising non-oil revenue to 600 billion riyals ($160 billion) by 2020 and 1 trillion riyals ($267 billion) by 2030 from 163.5 billion riyals ($43.6 billion) last year. But the plan gave few details on how this would be implemented, something that has bedevilled previous reforms. \n \n The 31-year-old prince gave assured answers to questions on the plan, and appeared to pitch his comments to appeal across the Saudi social spectrum, and in particular to young people, who face unemployment and an economic downturn despite their country\u2019s oil wealth. \n \n Even before oil prices started to plunge in 2014, economists had regarded Riyadh\u2019s fiscal policy and economic structure as being unsustainable, but reduced income from energy sales has made reform more urgent. \n \n The plan appeared to lift sentiment on the Saudi stock market .TASI, where shares jumped by 2.5 percent in the heaviest trading for eight months, but it fell short of convincing skeptics that the kingdom can prosper in an era of cheap oil. \n \n At the center of the plan is the restructuring of its Public Investment Fund (PIF), which Prince Mohammed said would become a hub for Saudi investment abroad, partly by raising money through selling shares in Aramco. \n \n Asked where Riyadh would find the funds for a $2 trillion dollar fund after recent borrowing, he said it would come from transferring the ownership of Aramco to the PIF. \n \n \u201cWe are speaking about more than $2 trillion. We expect the valuation to be more than $2 trillion. In addition to that there are other assets that will be added to the fund, and part of it is already added. \n \n He said it could \u201cturn into a global investment fund with a size of up to $3 trillion dollars\u201d. \n \n OPENING ARAMCO ACCOUNTS \n \n The partial privatization of Aramco was also central to the plans, and Prince Mohammed said it would be transformed into an energy company that he expected to be valued at $2 trillion to $3 trillion, and that less than 5 percent of it would be listed on the stock market. \n \n So big is the state oil company because of its rights to the kingdom\u2019s crude reserves, that selling even 1 percent of its value would create the biggest initial public offering (IPO) on earth, he said. \n \n He said other Aramco subsidiary companies would also be listed along with other publicly held companies, and added that one major benefit of privatization was that it would increase transparency and help limit corruption. \n \n \u201cPeople used to be unhappy that files and data of Aramco are undeclared, unclear and not transparent. Today they will be transparent. If Aramco gets IPO-ed that means it has to announce its statements of accounts,\u201d he said. \n \n Since the prince was appointed to oversee Saudi long-term planning through the Council of Economic and Development Affairs, Riyadh\u2019s focus on reform has grown far more urgent and far more acute. \n \n Prince Mohammed has enjoyed a dizzyingly rapid rise since his father became king 15 months ago, from being little known outside the ruling Al Saud family to become the driving force of Saudi plans to prepare for a future after oil. \n \n In his rare press conference, he presented himself as a modernizing leader who seeks to shake Saudi Arabia out of its economic slumber and its reputation for opacity and rigid bureaucracy, showing an interest in topics including education, the public role of women, and football. \n \n Saudi Arabia would prepare a new education curriculum, Prince Mohammed said. Despite previous reform attempts, the kingdom\u2019s schools have long been seen as focused on religious teachings rather than preparing students for a role in a modern economy. \n \n Under the plans, Saudi Arabia would produce or assemble half of its defense equipment internally in order to create job opportunities, he said, and Riyadh would make foreign investment easier. \n \n The government ran a deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) or 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 2015, officials said, and this year\u2019s budget plan aimed to cut that to 326 billion riyals ($87 billion). \n \n His economic team has already announced efforts to curb wasteful government spending, to diversify revenue streams by introducing sales tax and privatizing state assets, and to make reforms in the education sector. \n \n Such was the speculation among Saudis over the details of the plan that hashtags associated with it were the top two trending on Twitter on Monday in the country with the highest rate of social media use in the Middle East. \n \n But ambitious targets, such as raising the private sector share in the economy to 60 percent from 40 percent, reducing unemployment to 7.6 percent from 11 percent and growing non-oil income to 1 trillion riyals ($267 billion) from 163 billion riyals ($44 billion) were not explained further. \n \n PLANS \n \n Some Saudis said they had hoped for more detail on crucial issues such as education reform. There were no further details of plans to increase revenue from tax or of any changes to the political structure of the absolute monarchy. \n \n \u201cFor me as a Saudi, I am concerned by the education transformation plan,\u201d said a Saudi entrepreneur. \u201cIf it is not at the top of the list, why not?\u201d \n \n However, the plan also envisaged increasing women\u2019s participation in the workforce, something that has already grown quickly over the past five years, to 30 percent from 22 percent. \n \n But he also said he did not believe Saudi society was ready to end its ban on women driving. \n \n A green card system would also be launched within five years to enable expatriate Arabs and Muslims to live and work long-term in the country, Prince Mohammed said, in a major shift for the insular kingdom. \n \n But the focus was on economic restructuring to help reduce oil dependence. \n \n \u201cI think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive,\u201d Prince Mohammed said. \u201cWe need it, we need it, but I think in 2020 we can live without oil.\u201d \n \n Slideshow (6 Images) \n \n Appealing to Saudi youth, he ended his news conference by promising them a new Saudi Arabia. \n \n \u201cThe vision is not a dream, it\u2019s a reality that will come true,\u201d he said. \n \n ($1 = 3.7489 riyals) ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of Saudi Arabia's profits come from oil \n \n The Saudi cabinet has approved sweeping economic reforms aimed at moving the country away from its dependence on oil profits. \n \n Just over 70% of revenues came from oil last year but it has been hit by falling prices. \n \n One part of the plan will see shares sold in state-owned oil giant Aramco to create a sovereign wealth fund. \n \n Announcing the reforms, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described his country as being addicted to oil. \n \n Saudis react on social media \n \n The Vision 2030 plan, he told the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel, would ensure \"we can live without oil by 2020\". \n \n Among the reforms he announced in his interview were: \n \n Shares worth less than 5% of Aramco, a company he valued at up to $2.5tn (\u00a31.7tn), will be sold \n \n Some of the proceeds will go towards a sovereign wealth fund worth $2tn \n \n A new visa system will allow expatriate Muslims and Arabs to work long term in Saudi Arabia \n \n Steps will be taken to diversify the economy, including investment in mineral mining and expanding military production \n \n Participation of women in the workforce to increase \n \n Even just selling 1% of Aramco would create the biggest initial public offering in history, the prince said, outstripping blockbuster sales like Facebook and Alibaba. \n \n The IMF called the Saudi plan an \"ambitious, far-reaching effort\" but warned implementation would be a challenge. \n \n The cost of oil: analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest crude exporter \n \n Oil has made Saudi Arabia a major economic force. But it comes at a cost. The short-term problem is the volatile price of crude oil, which is now less than half what it was in mid-2014. Saudi Arabia has deep pockets. \n \n It will not go running to the International Monetary Fund for financial help, something another oil exporter, Angola, has done. But the Saudi reserves are eroding and with almost three quarters of government revenue coming from oil, the price fall is making itself felt. \n \n For the long term, international efforts to combat climate change create huge uncertainty about demand for oil in the future. Oil will not lose its dominance of the market for transport fuel in the next few years, but further ahead the outlook is unknown. \n \n So Saudi Arabia needs to become less dependent on oil for government revenue and for the jobs and incomes of Saudi nationals. \n \n Oil prices are still less than half the peak of $115 a barrel seen in June 2014. But the prince said the reforms would go ahead regardless of prices. \n \n \"The vision has nothing to do with crude prices,\" he said. \n \n \"If the oil price goes back up it would greatly support the vision but it does not need high prices.

Scientists hope to catch a glimpse of miniature black holes, multiple dimensions and even parallel universes. As they start to explore this wonderland, where nothing is quite what it seems, they may have to rewrite the fundamental laws of time and space. ||||| One contender for the smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole. (Shown here, an artist's drawing of a black hole pulling gas away from a companion star. \n \n The answer to the enduring question of the smallest thing in the universe has evolved along with humanity. People once thought grains of sand were the building blocks of what we see around us. Then the atom was discovered, and it was thought indivisible, until it was split to reveal protons, neutrons and electrons inside. These too, seemed like fundamental particles, before scientists discovered that protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each. \n \n \"This time we haven't been able to see any evidence at all that there's anything inside quarks,\" said physicist Andy Parker. \"Have we reached the most fundamental layer of matter?\" \n \n And even if quarks and electrons are indivisible, Parker said, scientists don't know if they are the smallest bits of matter in existence, or if the universe contains objects that are even more minute. [Graphic: Nature's Tiniest Particles] \n \n Parker, a professor of high-energy physics at England's Cambridge University, recently hosted a television special on the U.K.'s BBC Two channel called \"Horizon: How Small is the Universe?\" \n \n Strings or points? \n \n In experiments, teensy, tiny particles like quarks and electrons seem to act like single points of matter with no spatial distribution. But point-like objects complicate the laws of physics. Because you can get infinitely close to a point, the forces acting on it can become infinitely large, and scientists hate infinities. \n \n An idea called superstring theory could solve this issue. The theory posits that all particles, instead of being point-like, are actually little loops of string. Nothing can get infinitely close to a loop of string, because it will always be slightly closer to one part than another. That \"loophole\" appears to solve some of these problems of infinities, making the idea appealing to physicists. Yet scientists still have no experimental evidence that string theory is correct. \n \n Another way of solving the point problem is to say that space itself isn't continuous and smooth, but is actually made of discrete pixels, or grains, sometimes referred to as space-time foam. In that case, two particles wouldn't be able to come infinitely close to each other because they would always have to be separated by the minimum size of a grain of space. \n \n A singularity \n \n Another contender for the title of smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole. Black holes are formed when matter is condensed in a small enough space that gravity takes over, causing the matter to pull inward and inward, ultimately condensing into a single point of infinite density. At least, according to the current laws of physics. \n \n But most experts don't think black holes are really infinitely dense. They think this infinity is the product of an inherent conflict between two reigning theories \u2014 general relativity and quantum mechanics \u2014 and that when a theory of quantum gravity can be formulated, the true nature of black holes will be revealed. \n \n \"My guess is that [black hole singularities] are quite a lot smaller than a quark, but I don't believe they're of infinite density,\" Parker told LiveScience. \"Most likely they are maybe a million million times or even more than that smaller than the distances we've seen so far.\" \n \n That would make singularities roughly the size of superstrings, if they exist. \n \n The Planck length \n \n Superstrings, singularities, and even grains of the universe could all turn out to be about the size of the \"Planck length.\" [Tiny Grandeur: Stunning Photos of the Very Small] \n \n A Planck length is 1.6 x 10^-35 meters (the number 16 preceded by 34 zeroes and a decimal point) \u2014 an incomprehensibly small scale that is implicated in various aspects of physics. \n \n The Planck length is far and away too small for any instrument to measure, but beyond that, it is thought to represent the theoretical limit of the shortest measureable length. According to the uncertainty principle, no instrument should ever be able to measure anything smaller, because at that range, the universe is probabilistic and indeterminate. \n \n This scale is also thought to be the demarcating line between general relativity and quantum mechanics. \n \n \"It corresponds to the distance where the gravitational field is so strong that it can start to do things like make black holes out of the energy of the field,\" Parker said. \"At the Planck length we expect quantum gravity takes over.\" \n \n Perhaps all of the universe's smallest things are roughly the size of the Planck length. \n \n This story was provided by LiveScience, sister site to SPACE.com.

In fact, experts today balk at naming any point-like object \"the smallest\" because of a theoretical conundrum: When you're infinitely near any point, the forces that act on it turn infinitely huge. Hoping to duck the whole \"infinite\" thing, scientists have invented novel theories around it, physicist Andy Parker tells Space.com. Among the work-arounds: Superstring theory, which posits that particles are like loopy strings rather than points. This would enable scientists to get infinitely close to something but always remain further from another part of it. \"Space-time foam,\" the theory that space is made of pixels or grains. This would keeps particles from being infinitely close to each other, because the grain create a natural distance.

As they start to explore this wonderland, where nothing is quite what it seems, they may have to rewrite the fundamental laws of time and space. \u2013 The hunt for the smallest thing in the universe is under way, with scientists hoping to find evidence of black holes, parallel universes, and even tiny bits of matter, the Los Angeles Times reports. The BBC's How Small is the Universe? special tackled the question of matter's smallest bits, with physicist Andy Parker asking, \"Have we reached the most fundamental layer of matter? ... quarks and electrons are indivisible, or if the universe contains objects that are even more minute?\" One possibility is that black holes form when matter is condensed into a single point of infinite density, known as the \"singularity\"\u2014a point that can be infinitely close to a loop of string because it will always be slightly closer to one part than the other. But string theory hasn't been proven to be correct, and there's no evidence that two particles aren't physically separated by the minimum size of space. Another option is to say that space isn't continuous and smooth, but is actually made of discrete pixels or grains, sometimes referred to as space-time foam. In that case, two particles wouldn't be able to comeinfinite close to each other because they would always have to be separated by The Big Bang Theory' \u2013 Black holes are thought to be infinitely dense, but most experts don't think they're as dense as they think\u2014at least according to current laws of physics. \"My guess is that are quite a lot smaller than a quark, but I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re of infinite density,\" a physicist tells LiveScience. \"Most likely they are maybe a million million times or even more than that smaller than the distances we\u2019ve seen so far.\" If they do exist, they could be about the size of the \"Planck length,\" an incomprehensibly small scale that's believed to be the theoretical limit of the shortest measureable length of the universe. \"It corresponds to the distance where the gravitational field is so strong that it can start to do things like make black holes out of the energy of the field,\" the physicist says. \"At the Planck length we expect quantum gravity takes over.\"",

Gotthardt declined to identify the victim, but media reports have named the deceased teenage girl as Nabra Hassanen. \n \n Early Sunday morning, after she attended a Dulles-area mosque's midnight Ramadan prayers, Hassanen and her friends were confronted by a motorist as they walked back to the mosque from a nearby IHOP.

On Monday, they did not release any explanation as to why they weren\u2019t investigating the murder as a hate crime. \n \n Relatives identified the slain teen as Nabra Hassanen, 17, right, of Reston, seen in a social media post with a filter. (All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center) \n \n According to accounts from police and a mosque official, a group of four or five teens were walking back from breakfast at IHOP early Sunday when they were confronted by a motorist. All but one of the teens ran to the mosque, where the group reported that the girl had been left behind, according to Deputy Aleksandra Kowalski, a spokeswoman for the Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \n \n \u201cImmediately thereafter, the ADAMS\u2019 personnel notified both Loudoun County and Fairfax County authorities who immediately began an extensive search to locate the missing girl,\u201d the mosque said in a statement. \n \n Loudoun and Fairfax police jointly conducted an hours-long search around Dranesville Road and Woodson Drive in Herndon, which is in Fairfax. Remains thought to be the girl\u2019s were found about 3 p.m. Sunday in a pond in the 21500 block of Ridgetop Circle in Sterling. During the search, an officer spotted a motorist driving suspiciously in the area and arrested Torres, police said. \n \n Police said they collected several articles of evidence but declined to provide further details. \n \n The girl\u2019s mother said detectives told her that Nabra was struck with a metal bat. \n \n \u201cI can\u2019t think of a worse instance to occur than the loss of a 17-year-old on Father\u2019s Day, as the father of a 17-year-old myself,\u201d Loudoun County Sheriff Michael L. Chapman said. \n \n Detectives think the remains are those of the girl, but the chief medical examiner\u2019s office will confirm the identity and manner of death, Fairfax police spokeswoman Tawny Wright said. \n \n Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, of Sterling, has been charged in the teen\u2019s death. (Fairfax County Police) \n \n Shoyeb Hassan, the co-chair of ADAMS, said that during the last 10 days of Ramadan, the mosque has extra prayers at midnight and 2 a.m., and members frequently go to McDonald\u2019s or the 24-hour IHOP to eat before they start their fast at sunrise, as Nabra and her friends were doing. \n \n The killing rattled a Muslim community in the midst of celebrating Ramadan, a month of religious observance in which adherents fast from dawn to sunset for about a month. The period culminates in the feast-like celebration Eid al-Fitr, which is expected to fall next weekend. \n \n \u201cWe are devastated and heartbroken as our community undergoes and processes this traumatic event,\u201d Rizwan Jaka, chairman of ADAMS, said in a statement. \u201cIt is a time for us to come together to pray and care for our youth.\u201d \n \n ADAMS is Northern Virginia\u2019s largest mosque and, with 11 chapters around the District and Northern Virginia, is among the nation\u2019s most well-known congregations. According to ADAMS\u2019s website, the Sterling location is 25,000 square feet and can accommodate more than 700 people. It includes a youth weekend school, a gymnasium and multipurpose hall, the site says. \n \n Arsalan Iftikhar, an international human rights lawyer and commentator, said that he and his wife were at the mosque for evening prayers, which ended about 12:30 a.m. Sunday. As they were pulling out of the parking lot, he said, he saw a group of teenagers congregating and talking loudly about going out to eat. The girls, he said, were wearing the abaya, a full-length dress many Muslim women wear. \n \n [Van strikes crowd near mosque in London; one person is arrested] \n \n Police said Monday they aren\u2019t investigating the death as a hate crime, but the issue was on the minds of many Muslims on Sunday. \n \n Last month, two men on a Portland train were stabbed and killed after they intervened to protect two girls who were being harassed with anti-Muslim threats, according to authorities. \n \n Sunday night, a van struck a crowd of pedestrians, including worshipers leaving a pair of mosques in London. Witnesses said the pedestrians were struck as they departed late-night prayers. \n \n The ADAMS Center has a paid armed security guard at the Sterling site, according to Iftikhar. He said many mosques have increased security since six Muslim worshipers were killed at a mosque in Quebec earlier this year. \n \n [\u2018Brave and selfless\u2019 Oregon stabbing victims hailed as heroes for standing up to racist rants \n \n Nabra\u2019s slaying sent a chill through the community when news spread Sunday. \n \n \u201cPeople are petrified, especially people who have young Muslim daughters,\u201d Iftikhar said. \n \n Virginia officials condemned the killing Sunday night and expressed condolences to Nabra\u2019s family. \n \n Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said she visited ADAMS Sunday and met with leadership and law enforcement officials. \n \n \u201cWe are heartbroken and horrified by the news of the brutal murder of a beautiful 17-year old girl,\u201d Comstock said in a statement. \n \n The congresswoman represents Virginia\u2019s 10th District, where the mosque is located. \u201cWe know there is no greater pain for any parent and Chip and I extend our prayers to her family and loved ones at this difficult time and the entire ADAMS Center community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe commend the Fairfax County Police Department and the Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s office for their diligent work in apprehending the perpetrator. This case should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d \n \n Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said he and his wife, Pam, were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the assault and killing. \n \n \u201cThere is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our Commonwealth,\u201d Northam said in a statement. \u201cEvery Virginian should feel safe and welcome in our communities, and no parent should ever have to experience such a heartbreaking tragedy. As the police investigation continues, I urge all Virginians to keep Nabra\u2019s friends and family in their hearts.\u201d \n \n Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) echoed Northam, urging Virginians to show compassion and kindness. \n \n \u201cThe ADAMS Center has always welcomed me and so many in Northern Virginia like family,\u201d Herring said. \u201cThis unspeakable attack feels like an assault on our entire community. Words fail at a time like this, so we\u2019ll all have to do the best we can to surround them with the love and support they\u2019ve always shown each of us.\u201d \n \n On a crowdfunding page to support Nabra\u2019s family, donations surged Sunday night, jumping from $10,000 to nearly $18,000 in less than an hour. Shortly before 10 p.m., the fundraising page had met its $25,000 goal. \n \n In a neighborhood full of Muslim immigrant families, the Hassanens\u2019 modest Reston apartment was the one overflowing with friends and laughter most days, friends said Sunday. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a family where if you\u2019re feeling down and you need to laugh, this is where you go,\u201d said Samar Ali, 26, who grew up in the Hassanens\u2019 apartment complex. \n \n On Sunday night, that apartment normally filled with laughter was crammed with more than 30 women in traditional Muslim garb, sobbing and comforting one another. At the center of the crowded, dimly lit living room was Nabra\u2019s mother, Sawsan Gazzar. \n \n \u201cPlease pray for me, please pray for me,\u201d Gazzar sobbed in Arabic. Her phone rang constantly. To her brother and sister in her native Egypt, she said, \u201cPray for me that I can handle this . . . I lost my daughter, my first reason for happiness.\u201d \n \n The night before, Gazzar had cooked a feast for Nabra, the oldest of her four daughters, who wanted to host a big iftar break-the-fast dinner for all her friends from ADAMS and South Lakes High School, where she just finished 10th grade. \n \n The iftar was packed \u2014 Nabra was always popular and sociable. And when it ended, a friend\u2019s mom drove some of the teens to ADAMS for the midnight prayers that mark the last 10 days of Ramadan. Family members said she frequented the mosque during Ramadan. \n \n And during the holy month, the mosque was filled with teens like her. \n \n Gazzar said she thought Nabra and her friends would eat at the mosque after the prayers, and she would have forbidden her from walking to IHOP in the middle of the night. But she also wasn\u2019t surprised that the girl went out; she and other teens had done it safely last year. \n \n Other mothers in the apartment Sunday night echoed the same thought repeatedly \u2014 they and their children had always felt safe taking the sidewalk path to IHOP or McDonald\u2019s for a fun meal on those final Ramadan nights. \n \n Gazzar loaned her daughter an abaya to wear to the mosque Saturday night, since Nabra didn\u2019t typically wear traditional Muslim clothes. She heard from a detective that when the man in the car started shouting at the teens, Nabra tripped over the long garment and fell to the ground, just before she was struck. \n \n \u201cI think it had to do with the way she was dressed and the fact that she\u2019s Muslim,\u201d Gazzar said. \u201cWhy would you kill a kid? What did my daughter do to deserve this?\u201d \n \n Nabra was a diligent student, so much so that although she was extremely proud to get her first job ever at a McDonald\u2019s, she quit when her manager didn\u2019t understand that studying for a school exam took priority over a work shift. Family members were quick to note her interest in fashion and makeup, and her recently acquired nose ring. \n \n All four Hassanen girls were born in the United States \u2014 the younger ones are 11, 10 and 3. Ali described Nabra as a \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d who was close with her father, a bus-and-limo driver. Her father spent Sunday at the mosque, Ali said, beside himself with worry all day. \n \n Gazzar\u2019s phone rang yet again, and this time she didn\u2019t answer. She turned instead to the hundreds of photos stored on it, scrolling through them until she landed on one of Nabra visiting her parents\u2019 homeland in Egypt, laughing as she embraced two of the teen\u2019s little sisters. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019d all be laughing. They used to be really happy.\u201d \n \n She gazed into the girls\u2019 eyes, and cried harder. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated the number of Muslim girls who were being harassed in Portland. One of the two girls identifies as Muslim.The story has also been updated to clarify earlier information. ||||| See more of Mindy Kaling on Facebook ||||| FAIRFAX, VA (WUSA9) - Fairfax Police believe they found the body of a 17-year-old girl who they think went missing from The ADAMS Center Mosque early Sunday morning. \n \n The girl was walking from The ADAMS Center toward a shopping center to get food with a group of friends around 3 a.m., police said. \n \n That is when a man driving a red car got out of his car and confronted the teens.

No elaboration was given. But that hasn't kept a religious bent out of discussion of and reactions to Nabra Hassanen's killing.

WUSA9 reports police did recover a bat. \"What investigators told the father and the mother, he hit her in the head and put her in the car and he threw her in the water,\" the Richmond Times-Dispatch quotes a rep for the family as saying. It reports Martinez Torres directed officers to the pond, which it says is near the apartment he lives in. The Post fills in some details on the girls' movements, reporting that during the final 10 days of the holy month of Ramadan, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) in Sterling, Va., holds extra prayers at midnight and 2am. The mosque is one of the largest in the US, and ADAMS' co-chair says it is commonplace for members to have a meal at McDonald\u2019s or IHOP in advance of the day's fast, which runs from sunrise to sunset. Nabra, a rising high school junior, was not particularly religious and did not usually wear Muslim dress, according to her mother, who lent Nabra an abaya to wear to the mosque Saturday night. She tells the Post a detective told her that during the fateful encounter, Nabra tripped over the long garment and fell. Bustle reports that while this may not be a hate crime, the number of anti-Muslim hate groups did spike in 2016 to 101, about triple the number the Southern Poverty Law Center recorded in 2015.

The Sanchez's claim that their own agent, Jason Bercy, gave them only 22 minutes to review the contract and threatened that if they didn't sign immediately, Nick would \"pass on Caitlin for the part of Dora.\"Bercy is not named in the suit and when contacted declined to comment.

    "document": "'Smoking gun' emails reveal News of the World bribes to police FOUR YEARS ago \n \n \n \n An internal report uncovered 'smoking gun' evidence of criminal behaviour at the News of the World four years ago, it emerged yesterday. \n \n The damning dossier was based on 300 emails that suggested hacking was widespread and journalists were paying police. \n \n However it was not handed to Scotland Yard until last month. The revelation adds to mounting claims of a cover-up by News International bosses, who paid hush money to several high-profile hacking victims. \n \n Criminal behaviour: An internal report uncovered 'smoking gun' evidence at the News of the World four years ago, it has emerged \n \n Documents leaked to the Sunday Times, which is owned by News International, allegedly show a \u2018cabal\u2019 of six journalists acted as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who carried out hacking for the paper on a huge scale. \n \n Sources said the emails show clear proof of criminal offences. \n \n \n \n One told the Sunday Times: \u2018During its document trawl on the hacking stuff they discovered some emails which seem to suggest that senior journalists had been paying substantial sums of money to police officers. They were clearly evidence of serious crime.\u2019 \n \n Smoking gun: Emails uncovered in an internal investigation revealed reporters were paying bribes to police \n \n \n \n \n \n Further details of the alleged cover-up were revealed by the BBC\u2019s Robert Peston, who is close to News International\u2019s chief troubleshooter, Will Lewis. \n \n He said that four years ago, the company found emails showing payments were being made to the police for information, although this evidence of alleged criminal behaviour was not handed to the Met until this June. \n \n Although the emails do not identify police officers by name, they cross refer to the company\u2019s cash records which identify the same four-figure sums mentioned in the emails. The total amount is said to be in the region of \u00a3120,000. \n \n They also allegedly show that phone hacking went wider than the activities of a single rogue reporter. That was the News of the World\u2019s initial claim when the paper\u2019s royal reporter, Clive Goodman, was jailed in 2007 \u2013 the year in which the emails were found. \n \n In a letter presented to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, Harbottle & Lewis confirmed it had been asked by News International to review whether the illegal actions of Goodman were known to his News of the World colleagues. \n \n A further 2,200 News of the World emails, which may contain evidence of criminal behaviour by the paper\u2019s staff, are reported to be missing. \n \n In this letter, dated 29 May 2007, and sent to Jon Chapman of News International, Lawrence Abramson of Harbottle & Lewis said they did \u2018not find anything in those emails which appeared to us to be reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman\u2019s illegal actions were known about and supported by both or either of Andy Coulson, the editor, and Neil Wallis, the deputy editor, and/or that Ian Edmondson, the news editor, and others were carrying out similar illegal procedures\u2019. \n \n The letter from Mr Abramson to Mr Chapman makes no mention of whether the emails contain evidence of wrongdoing by journalists other than Mr Goodman. \n \n However, when Will Lewis and his fellow News International executives re-acquired those emails from Harbottle & Lewis, they found what they perceived to be evidence that the illegal phone hacking went wider than just the activities of Mr Goodman and there were potentially illegal payments to the police. \n \n A further 2,200 News of the World emails, which may contain evidence of criminal behaviour by the paper\u2019s staff, are reported to be missing. \n \n The revelations will pile pressure on News International\u2019s chairman, James Murdoch, son of Rupert, and he could even face criminal charges in both Britain and America. \n \n Former home secretary Alan Johnson has suggested he could be prosecuted under anti-snooping legislation. This is because Mr Murdoch admitted in a statement last Thursday that he had approved out of court settlements to hacking victims. \n \n He said he was not aware of the specific details, but legal action could still possibly be taken under section 79 of the Regulation of Investigative Powers Act 2000, which covers the \u2018criminal liability of directors\u2019. \n \n Four years ago the then executive chairman of News International, Les Hinton, told MPs he believed royal editor Goodman was acting alone. \n \n \n \n Yates of the Yard faces calls to quit after apology for c**p investigation \n \n By MARTIN DELGADO \n \n Politicians called for a senior Scotland Yard officer to step down yesterday hours after he made an unprecedented apology for his handling of the hacking affair. \n \n \n \n John Yates, who is an assistant commissioner in the Met, said he deeply regretted not launching a second probe into the News of the World scandal two years ago. \n \n \n \n He said he had let down the victims and the Yard had been damaged. \n \n Apology: Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner John Yates has admitted he let down the victims of phone hacking in the first investigation \n \n \u2018I didn\u2019t do a review,\u2019 he told the Sunday Telegraph. \u2018Had I known then what I know now, all bets are off. I would never have reached this conclusion. \n \n \n \n \u2018I am accountable and it happened on my watch and it\u2019s clear I could have done more. \n \n \n \n \u2018I have regrettably said the initial inquiry was a success. Clearly now that looks very different.\u2019 \n \n \n \n Mr Yates also dismissed claims \u2013 currently doing the rounds in police and media circles \u2013 that he had had any sort of relationship with Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International. \n \n \n \n Facing police questions: news International chief executive Rebekah Wade \n \n His decision to make his apology in a newspaper, rather than to MPs, prompted a furious political reaction. \n \n \n \n Tory ex-minister David Mellor said: \u2018If it had been left to the police it would all have been shovelled under the carpet and the heads of the Metropolitan Police would be down stuffing their faces in News International\u2019s boardroom having a jolly old time with Rupert and his chums.\u2019 \n \n \n \n David Davis, another Tory former minister, said: \u2018He should be appearing in front of parliament and answering questions, not putting out effectively a press release himself.\u2019 \n \n \n \n Mr Yates said News of the World staff had covered up the \u2018industrial scale\u2019 of the phone hacking operation by insisting just one rogue reporter was to blame. \n \n \n \n \u2018When we made the arrests in 2006 on the day we went to Wapping there was a Mexican stand-off, a lock down, and they wouldn\u2019t let us in,\u2019 he said. \n \n \n \n The initial police investigation led to the jailing of News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. \n \n \n \n But, despite fresh allegations that thousands of public figures had been targeted, Mr Yates decided in July 2009 that there was no new evidence. \n \n \n \n A senior Yard source said Mr Yates would not resign, adding: \u2018He is an honourable man and he has done the right thing in making a very public apology.\u2019 \n \n \n \n Hindsight: Yates said that if he had known then what he knows now, he would have upped the police investigation into the phone hacking \n \n This was despite Yates saying he had never seen the 11,000 pages from private investigator Glenn Mulcaire's notebooks, which had been seized by police. \n \n 'I'm not going to go down and look at bin bags,' he said. 'I am supposed to be an Assistant Commissioner. Perhaps I should have been more demanding. I am accountable, and it happened on my watch, and it's clear I could have done more.' \n \n 'NINE JOURNALISTS AND THREE POLICE FACING JAIL \n \n At least nine journalists and three police officers face jail over the phone-hacking scandal, according to reports from inside News International. \n \n Internal papers dating from 2007 are understood to have contained evidence that hacking was more widespread than previously admitted. Scotland Yard was apparently not told about the document at the time but now has a copy. \n \n A News International source was last night quoted as saying: 'We were sitting on a ticking timebomb'. \n \n New documents are said to reveal that six journalists acted as 'gatekeepers' to private detective Glenn Mulcaire. They and three other journalists who knew about Mulcaire's activities may be charged, according to a Sunday Times report. \n \n Separately, a cache of emails and cash records is thought to shed light on potential four-figure payments to police officers. \n \n Meanwhile, News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks faces questioning by police in the coming days. The former News of the World editor is expected to be asked to present herself at a police station to explain, under caution, what she knew about phone-hacking and payments to police officers. \n \n A News International source insisted she would be treated as a witness, not a suspect. \n \n However, both the company and Scotland Yard refused to comment on whether Brooks would be quizzed. \n \n \n \n In his extraordinary interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Yates was also forced to deny that he had a relationship with the News of the World's former editor Rebekah Brooks, now News International's chief executive. He dismissed the claims as 'malicious gossip'. \n \n In a remarkable admission, Mr Yates, who has been widely criticised for failing to expose the full extent of the scandal, said: 'Should I have come out so quickly and said there wasn't anything in it? Tactically, I probably shouldn't have. \n \n 'I should have cogitated and reflected but it's so bloo dy obvious there was nothing there [that we didn't already know]. \n \n 'I didn't do a review. Had I known then what I know now \u2013 all bets are off. In hindsight there is a shed load of stuff in there I wish I'd known.' \n \n Mr Yates was brought in two years ago to review the results of an earlier police investigation which led to the jailings of Mulcaire and News of the World Royal editor Clive Goodman. \n \n But last night he said: 'Not in a million years did I ever think we would get to this point when I came to it in July 2009. It was relatively straightforward. \n \n 'The Guardian had raised a lot of issues. It was a bloody great story but the question was: was there anything new in it for us? The answer was no there wasn't.' \n \n In an unprecedented apology to the victims of phone hacking \u2013 and in particular to the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, whose phone messages were intercepted \u2013 Mr Yates said: 'We are all extremely shocked by it and it is a matter of massive regret we didn't deal with it earlier. \n \n 'My byword has always been you look after the victims and the job will always resolve itself. I always put the victim first but here I didn't follow my principle and that is my greatest regret.' \n \n Of the rumours regarding his relationship with Mrs Brooks, he said: 'There has been a huge amount of malicious gossip. I have laughed at it all. It is quite astonishing. I take it with a large pinch of salt. It's not true.' \n \n He said other suggestions of improper relationships, made under the protection of parliamentary privilege, had deeply upset him. \n \n Describing them as 'contemptible, utterly untrue, and cowardly', he said: 'I will take whatever action I can to defend myself on that. It can be shown on any number of levels to be false. Apart from that, I haven't got any strong views about it.' \n \n The \u00a3180,000-a-year officer \u2013 dubbed 'Yates of the Yard' \u2013 split from Louise, his wife of 25 years, in the spring of 2009. \n \n The pair separated, around the time that Yates \u2013 educated at fee-paying Marlborough College \u2013 was appointed Britain's top anti-terror officer. \n \n He started a relationship with senior Yard Press officer Felicity Ross, who is in her 30s. She worked for Met chief Sir Paul Stephenson, though she has since left the police. Later in the interview, Mr Yates refers to the News International chief executive by her first name. \n \n Asked whether Mrs Brooks should resign, he says: 'I think it is a matter for Rebekah, her company and her conscience. It has nothing to do with us.' \n \n But he said it was a 'surprising development' that Mrs Brooks was still in her job. \n \n He added: 'I have been around this business a number of years and have good relationships with the media, which I think is part of my role to help inform the context and some of them are in the News of the World.' \n \n Mr Yates condemned the News of the World's failure to reveal emails relating to hacking until January of this year. \n \n The newspaper had covered up the 'industrial scale' of its phone-hacking operation by insisting that one 'rogue reporter' was to blame. \n \n He said Scotland Yard's reputation had been 'very damaged' by its failures. \n \n Explaining his much-criticised decision to close the case, he said: 'To have given the go-ahead for a full review of a case of that nature would have involved four or five people and five or six months work and a lot of resources and in July 2009 why would I do that?' \n \n \n \n ||||| News of the World is accused of hacking phones of 9/11 victims \n \n Murdoch journalists 'wanted phone records of British victims' \n \n Rebekah Brooks may be questioned under caution in coming weeks \n \n \n \n Ed Miliband launches bid to postpone BSkyB takeover \n \n \n \n Ground zero: News of the World reporters allegedly tried to hack phones of 9/11 victims \n \n News of the World reporters tried to hack the voicemails of dead 9/11 victims, a former New York policeman claimed last night. \n \n He alleged he was contacted by News of the World journalists who said they would pay him to retrieve the private phone records of the dead. \n \n The former cop, who now works as a private investigator, said that reporters wanted British victim\u2019s mobile numbers and details of calls in the days surrounding the tragedy. \n \n The voicemails are likely to have included harrowing messages from distraught relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001. \n \n \n \n A source told the Daily Mirror: 'This investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims\u2019 private phone data. \n \n \n \n 'He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their \u00adrelatives. \n \n 'His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the \u00adrelevant voicemails, just like it has been shown they have done in the UK. The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look.' \n \n The source said that the \u00adjournalists were interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks. \n \n \n \n Under American law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) makes it a crime for American companies to offer corrupt payments to foreign government officials. \n \n If the allegations of payments to police officers are proven, Mr Murdoch could face an American prosecution in his role as deputy chief operating officer the US-listed News Corp. \n \n A former New York police officer has also claimed that News of the World journalists tried to pay him for phone details of British 9/11 victims \n \n Capitalising on grief: Reporters were allegedly tried to get hold frantic calls as the tragedy unfolded \n \n In 2009, the former Hollywood producer Gerald Green was jailed for six months after being prosecuted under the FCPA for making $1.8m (\u00a31.1m) in bribes to a Thai government official. Butler University law professor Mike Koehler, an FCPA expert, said: 'I would be very surprised if the U.S. authorities don't become involved in this News International conduct.' \n \n He said the FCPA could be invoked because News Corp is an American company and because the alleged payments would have been made in order for the newspaper to make money from the stories obtained. \n \n Brett Pulley, media correspondent for the Bloomberg news agency in New York, said: 'If the fall out were to continue, my goodness, if it were to impact James Murdoch, then we start to talk about it impacting News Corp\u2019s succession plan, so that affects the company globally.' \n \n Paul Farhi, media correspondent for The Washington Post, added: 'There\u2019s a whole domino effect. What else falls apart? Do bankers get nervous? \n \n 'Rupert Murdoch had one flirtation with bankruptcy in the early 90s. He\u2019s very dependent on the goodwill of Wall Street and of bankers. \n \n \u201cHis company is very profitable now \u2014 it\u2019s not quite the same as the 1990s \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t want these dominoes to keep toppling \u2026 \n \n 'The fact he shut down a newspaper reflects how seriously the scandal is affecting a whole empire.' \n \n In Slate.com, noted commentator Jack Shafer wrote: 'Like all reverse-ferret manoeuvres, the closing of News of the World is designed to scatter and confuse the audience. It looks like the sacrifice of something very special to him, seeing as it was his first U.K. newspaper acquisition in 1968. But it's not. \n \n 'It looks like atonement, but it's not. It's supposed to change the subject, but it's too late for that. \n \n 'The most shocking thing to me about the paper's closure is what an empty gesture it is. \n \n 'I expected much better from the genocidal tyrant. \n \n 'The tricky thing about the reverse ferret is that unless you nab the beast the moment it bursts out of a pant leg, it can be impossible to apprehend. \n \n 'From the way News Corp. is acting, it looks to me as if the Murdochs have lost control of their precious ferret. If I were Rupert Murdoch, I'd start wearing my socks over my cuffs. Ferrets will eat anything that looks and smells like meat.' \n \n T he claims came as the disgraced paper's owner Rupert Murdoch flew into London to take personal charge of the phone-hacking scandal. \n \n He first stopped at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London, where he arrived in a red Range Rover, a copy of the last edition of the News of the World in his hands. \n \n Protective: Rupert Murdoch guides Rebekah Brooks away from the media as they leave his London flat \n \n Family affairs: James Murdoch leaves his father's Mayfair apartment yesterday. He later joined Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at the Stafford Hotel where they were expected to dine together \n \n \n \n Later yesterday he put on an extraordinary show of support for Rebekah Brooks - apparently unconcerned about her imminent interview under police caution. \n \n Mrs Brooks, who has twice offered to resign over the controversy, was seen entering Mr Murdoch's Mayfair apartment at around 5.30pm yesterday. \n \n Later, when asked what was his top priority, the 80-year-old media mogul gestured to Mrs Brooks. 'She is,' he replied. \n \n The pair spent an hour in the apartment on the day the final edition of the News of the World hit news stands. \n \n Then, in front of hordes of photographers, Mr Murdoch walked Mrs Brooks out of the block of flats with his arm firmly around her. \n \n Last hurrah: Editor of the News of the World, Colin Myler, poses with staff outside the newspaper offices for the last time \n \n They had beaming smiles as they crossed the road to the Stafford Hotel, where they were expected to dine together. They were later joined by Mr Murdoch\u2019s son, James, the chairman of News International. \n \n Pictures of the 'Rupert and Rebekah show' will infuriate the victims of phone hacking and those who question her denials. \n \n The phone hacking row erupted last week when fresh allegations emerged that News or the World journalists paid private investigators to hack into the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. \n \n They are also alleged to have listened in on voice messages from the family of Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. \n \n Hordes of advertisers finally abandoned the 'toxic' paper, forcing it to close, when it was revealed that they may have hacked into the phones of war dead. \n \n Alleged victims: The families of murdered schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman are claimed to have had their phone hacked alongside Milly Dowler when she was missing \n \n \n \n A string of the paper's senior executives, including Mrs Brooks, face being quizzed as potential suspects or witnesses over their roles in the phone-hacking scandal which brought down the 168-year-old title she once edited. \n \n Mrs Brooks is set to be questioned under caution in London in the next two weeks. She will be asked to give a full account of her actions during the period from 2000 to 2003 when she was editor. \n \n It has also been revealed that at least nine former News of the World journalists, and three police officers, face charges over the hacking and corruption scandal. \n \n Meanwhile, a 63-year-old man arrested on Friday has been bailed. Officers would not confirm reports he is a private investigator \n \n The scandal has threatened Murdoch's controversial bid to take full control of BSkyB. \n \n Labour leader Ed Miliband plans to attempt to force through a Commons vote this week that could see the deal postponed until after the police investigation into phone hacking is complete. \n \n M<r Miliband said yesterday: 'The idea that this organisation, which has engaged in these terrible \u00adpractices, should be allowed to take over BSkyB... without that criminal investigation having been completed, and on the basis of assurances from that self-same \u00adorganisation\u2026 frankly that won\u2019t wash with the public.' ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rupert Murdoch has met Rebekah Brooks over the phone-hacking scandal \n \n News International found e-mails in 2007 that appeared to indicate that payments were being made to the police for information, although this evidence of alleged criminal behaviour was not handed to the Metropolitan Police for investigation until 20 June of this year. \n \n According to sources, these e-mails were in the possession of the firm of solicitors, Harbottle & Lewis. \n \n They were retrieved from Harbottle & Lewis by lawyers acting for News Interernational and for William Lewis - general manager of News International - who is in charge of News International's clean-up of what went wrong at the News of the World (and who was recruited by News International last July). \n \n The e-mails appear to show Andy Coulson, editor of the News of the World from 2003-2007, authorising payments to the police for help with stories. \n \n They also appear to show that phone hacking went wider than the activities of a single rogue reporter, which was the News of the World's claim at the time. \n \n Mr Coulson, who subsequently became David Cameron's director of communications in 10 Downing Street, was arrested and bailed last week. \n \n In a letter presented to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee, Harbottle & Lewis confirmed that it had been asked by News International to review whether the illegal actions of Clive Goodman - the News of the World's former royal editor, jailed in 2007 for phone hacking - were known to his News of the World colleagues. \n \n In this letter, dated 29 May 2007, and sent to Jon Chapman of News International, Lawrence Abramson of Harbottle & Lewis wrote that it had \"reviewed e-mails to which you have provided access from the accounts of Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Ian Edmondson, Clive Goodman, Neil Wallis, Jules Stenson\". \n \n Mr Abramson confirmed to Mr Chapman that it \"did not find anything in those e-mails which appeared to us to be reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman's illegal actions were known about and supported by both or either of Andy Coulson, the editor, and Neil Wallis, the deputy editor, and/or that Ian Edmondson, the news editor, and others were carrying out similar illegal procedures\". \n \n The letter from Mr Abramson to Mr Chapman makes no mention of whether the e-mails contain evidence of wrongdoing by journalists other than Mr Goodman. \n \n However, when William Lewis and his fellow News International executives re-acquired those e-mails from Harbottle & Lewis, they found what they perceived to be prima facie evidence that the illegal phone hacking went wider than just the activities of Mr Goodman and that there were potentially illegal payments to the police. \n \n William Lewis went looking for these e-mails after the Metropolitan Police of Operation Weeting, who are investigating alleged phone hacking, enquired about the existence of 2,500 e-mails that Colin Myler - who replaced Andy Coulson as editor of the News of the World - mentioned to MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport committee. \n \n Mr Myler told the MPs these e-mails had been trawled through as part of his own inquiry into whether hacking was carried out by others than Mr Goodman. \n \n In response to a question by the MP Philip Davies about whether Mr Goodman was working alone, Mr Myler said: \"I conducted this inquiry with Daniel Cloke, our director of human resources. Over 2,500 e-mails were accessed because we were exploring whether or not there was any other evidence to suggest essentially what you are hinting at. No evidence was found; that is up to 2,500 e-mails\". \n \n William Lewis and his News International colleagues on a newly created management and standards committee have not found the full 2,500 e-mails mentioned by Mr Myler, just the sub-set of 300 that were passed to Harbottle & Lewis. \n \n The disclosure that News International found 300 e-mails as long ago as 2007, that indicated wider malpractices at the News of the World than those which led to the jailing of Mr Goodman and of the private detective Glenn Mulcaire, will pose very difficult questions for News International's chairman, James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. \n \n In December 2007, James Murdoch took charge of News International as chief executive of the European and Asian operations of its parent company, News Corporation. \n \n Some four months later, in April 2008, he authorised the payment of a substantial out-of-court settlement, running to hundreds of thousands of pounds, with Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, over the hacking of Mr Taylor's phone. \n \n That settlement - which was agreed by Mr Murdoch and signed by News International's chief operating officer at the time, Clive Milner - contained a gagging clause, making it impossible for either party to talk about the settlement or what led to it (though many of its details were subsequently revealed by the Guardian). \n \n Mr Murdoch has now conceded that it was wrong of him to agree to the settlement with Mr Taylor and also to other out-of-court settlements made at a similar time. \n \n He said on Thursday: \"I now know that I did not have a complete picture when I did so. This was wrong and is a matter of serious regret.\" \n \n There have been allegations that Mr Murdoch, in settling with Mr Taylor, was endeavouring to put a lid on the furore to deter a wider police investigation of the News of the World's behaviour. \n \n News International denies this. \n \n It insists that Mr Murdoch only approved the Taylor settlement and gagging clause because he was ignorant of the alleged transgressions by other News of the World journalists. \n \n In particular, News International says Mr Murdoch had no knowledge of the 300 e-mails that Harbottle & Lewis were asked to review.",

    "document": "There\u2019s no doubt the public outcry over the News of the World\u2019s illegal hacking of mobile phones and payments to police officials is serious. Rupert Murdoch doesn\u2019t close profitable newspapers willingly. (Heck, he doesn\u2019t even like to close massively unprofitable papers.) But is it so serious that a top News Corp. executive \u2014 perhaps even Murdoch himself \u2014 could end up being convicted on criminal charges? \n \n Andreas Whittam Smith thinks so. He cites the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act of 2000, the law used to imprison News of the World reporter Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who teamed up to invade the voicemail accounts of various celebrities. Smith notes that the law, as worded, has remarkably broad scope: \n \n Where an offence under any provision of this Act\u2026 is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he (as well as the body corporate) shall be guilty of that offence and liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. \n \n \u201cIf you have presided over an organisation that has conducted criminal activities, either you gave the orders, or you gave permission, or you connived, but if you did none of these things, then you were neglectful,\u201d writes Smith. \u201cThat is the trap, that is the box in which the directors of News International will find themselves.\u201d \n \n I ran this reading by Jonathan P. Armstrong, a partner at the law firm Duane Morris who specializes in corporate law with a concentration in technology and compliance. \u201cMy view is that might be a stretch,\u201d he says. That\u2019s because the application of the \u201cattributable to any neglect\u201d clause isn\u2019t quite as broad as it sounds. \u201cThat sort of clause exists because it\u2019s lifted out of health and safety legislation,\u201d he says. \u201cSay you had an airplane and you never changed the tires. I don\u2019t think, in the U.K., something like failure to have a policy preventing hacking \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be a big enough neglect to get by a jury.\u201d \n \n Where the neglect cause could conceivably apply is to Rebekah Brooks, News International\u2019s CEO. Brooks has denied having any knowledge of the illegal hacking, but she was editor of the NotW at the time it published stories that cited voice mail messages obtained that way, and it was Brooks who first hired the private investigator who hacked the voicemail of murdered teenager Milly Dowler. In Brooks\u2019s case, therefore, it\u2019s possible to argue that the only way she wouldn\u2019t have known about the hacking was by making it clear she didn\u2019t want to know. \u201cThe quaint old English saying for that we have is \u2018Nelsonian ignorance,\u2019\u201d says Armstrong. The phrase refers to Lord Nelson, the famed admiral who was blind in one eye. \n \n Already, police are reportedly planning to arrest Andy Coulson, who succeeded Brooks as editor, either on similar grounds or because they have evidence that he did, in fact, condone the hacking. \n \n But don\u2019t expect the arrests to rise to the very top of the News Corp. food chain \u2014 to Rupert Murdoch, or even to his son, James \u2014 unless evidence tying them directly to the illegal hacks comes to light. \u201cThe reality is cases that are that much of a stretch normally don\u2019t run in the U.K.,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same system you have in the U.S. of an attorney general who might see a lot of merit, politically, in seeing this go ahead. Generally speaking, prosecutions will only run where the prosecutors are convinced they\u2019ll be able to persuade the jury beyond all reasonable doubt that the guy had his hands all over this.\u201d ||||| The 168-year-old News of the World, the widest-read paper in the English-speaking world, has acknowledged that it hired \u201cinvestigators\u201d who hacked into the phone accounts of politicians, celebrities and ordinary Britons in an attempt to develop stories. The targets of the paper\u2019s hacking apparently included the families of British troops killed in Afghanistan, victims of the 2005 London transit bombings and a 13-year-old missing girl who was later found dead. \n \n Murdoch, 80, has weathered criticism and crises before, most notably the near-bankruptcy of News Corp. in 1990. But the phone-hacking scandal is easily the most dire public-relations debacle of the Australian-turned-American\u2019s storied business career. \n \n Public outrage over the phone tapping has led to rare condemnation of Murdoch in the British Parliament and even from Prime Minister David Cameron, who has enjoyed Murdoch\u2019s political support. Because of his outsize role in the U.K. media, Murdoch has been among the most powerful and influential forces in British politics for many years. \n \n Although there is no evidence that Murdoch was aware of the News of the World\u2019s illegal behavior, the scandal has shaken his dominant role in the British media establishment and has tarnished his stewardship of an empire that includes such U.S. properties as the Fox TV network, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. \n \n The scandal has also threatened to derail News Corp.\u2019s bid to gain control of British Sky Broadcasting, the largest pay TV provider in the United Kingdom. News Corp. owns 39 percent of the satellite company and is trying to gobble up the balance in a deal worth about $12 billion. Regulatory approval of its bid is pending, and the outcome could be an indicator of public sentiment toward the newspaper\u2019s behavior. \n \n Some observers suggested Thursday that the scandal could affect who succeeds Murdoch at the top of his company, which he built into a colossus after inheriting two small Australian papers from his father 58 years ago. Murdoch\u2019s heir apparent, son James, oversees the company\u2019s British newspaper division and announced the tabloid\u2019s demise in its London newsroom. \n \n Many here are calling for the dismissal of Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World editor who is chief executive of its immediate parent company, News International. Brooks was editor of the paper in 2002 when a private detective working on its behalf allegedly hacked into the voice-mail of slain teenager Milly Dowling and erased one of the messages. But both Rupert and James Murdoch have remained loyal to Brooks. \u201cI am satisfied that Rebekah \u2014 her leadership and her standard of ethics and her standard of conduct \u2014 is very good,\u201d the younger Murdoch told BBC News in an interview. ||||| I am going to describe how action should be swiftly taken to curb Rupert Murdoch and his newspapers now that supposition and dark suspicion have become proven fact. News International, a large and powerful media organisation, Mr Murdoch's company, systematically invades people's privacy through phone hacking, corrupts the police by making large payments to individual officers, and compromises fair trials as a result of publishing reports that are likely to prejudice juries. \n \n It operates without restraint and has no sense of right or wrong. It doesn't yet represent the same threat to British society as the Italian mafia does to Italy. But there are sufficient similarities to tell us that if we don't act now, worse will follow. For unchecked, News International's illegal practices would grow ever more far reaching, more police officers would be suborned, more trials ruined. And more politicians would be bent to Mr Murdoch's will. For, just as Italian politicians have courted the mafia, so British politicians have fawned over News International executives and editors. David Cameron, the Prime Minister, even brought a former editor into Downing Street who, it is now alleged, authorised the payments of bribes to the police. Well meaning though large advertisers may be in withdrawing their business from the News of the World, that won't curb Mr Murdoch. And although I have willingly signed up to the campaign that calls for a public inquiry ( hackinginquiry.org/), that would only be a staging post. In fact, the mechanisms to bring the directors of News International to book already exist. They are part of the law of the land. \n \n The most important step is to make use of the powers contained in what is known as The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. It was under Section 1 of this Act that the News of the World phone hackers were convicted and imprisoned. So far as the directors and executives of News International in their personal capacities are concerned, the crucial passage in the legislation comes towards the end of the Act. It is Section 79. \n \n Forgive me for now penetrating deeply into the thickets of the law, but eventually, in the growing scandal of the News of the World's behaviour, everything will turn on Section 79. I hope charges will be brought under this section. It is entitled the \"Criminal liability of directors etc\". (I like the \"etc\"). It states that \"Where an offence under any provision of this Act... is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he (as well as the body corporate) shall be guilty of that offence and liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.\" \n \n To see how Section 79 might work, start with the smaller fry, say Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International. In a letter to staff published earlier this week, Ms Brooks, following the revelations that her reporters had hacked into the mobile phone of the murdered schoolgirl, Milly Dowler, when she was editor of the News of the World, attempted to exculpate herself. \"We were all appalled and shocked when we heard about these allegations yesterday... At the moment we only know what we have read... I hope that you all realise it is inconceivable that I knew or worse, sanctioned these appalling allegations.\" In other words, Ms Brooks is claiming that she was unaware of the criminal invasion of privacy that had the effect of vainly raising the hopes of the parents that their daughter was still alive and that at the same impeded the police operation. \n \n But go back to the Act. To avoid criminal proceedings, having not initiated or consented to the Dowler phone hacking won't do as a defence because there are other tests. Let us go to these. Connived? That would require an examination of how Ms Brooks habitually conducted herself as editor. \"Connived\", for instance, might be warmly congratulating reporters who produced stories that could only have been acquired illegally. But perhaps there was no connivance. Even so, Ms Brooks would not be home safe and dry. \"Where an offence is... attributable to any neglect\", states the Act. \n \n This is the catch-all section of the Act. If you have presided over an organisation that has conducted criminal activities, either you gave the orders, or you gave permission, or you connived, but if you did none of these things, then you were neglectful. That is the trap, that is the box in which the directors of News International will find themselves. It is also the bit that Ms Brooks would find hard to understand. For, as she indicated earlier this week, she isn't going to resign.\"I am aware of the speculation about my position. Therefore it is important you all know that as chief executive, I am determined to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues.\" This comes straight out of the dishonorable, cowardly, defensive, mind-your-back school of management that says that if I didn't know, I cannot be blamed. It doesn't recognise neglect. Instead it substitutes the self-serving, conceited thesis that \"only I, who was at the helm during the disaster, can steer us to safety\". \n \n But what about Mr Murdoch? Would he be touched by Section 79? Only a lawyer could give an authoritative opinion. But I note these words in the Act. It bears on a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or \"any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity\" (my italics). \n \n Whether Mr Murdoch falls under this rubric would be for a court to decide. But I have no doubt that Mr Murdoch does act as if he were a director or a manager. For although technically News International is part of a public company, for all intents and purposes it is conducted as if it were a court with Mr Murdoch as its sovereign. One reason why Ms Brooks isn't resigning is that she is a courtier. Courtiers don't resign. They stay or go at the monarch's pleasure. And while it may be difficult for company lawyers to understand a monarchical organisation, judges should do so \u2013 for they are, after all, \"Her Majesty's Judges\". \n \n Rupert Murdoch has owned the News of the World for nearly 42 years. When he arrived in England as an unknown Australian newspaper proprietor to bid for the News of the World in 1969 in opposition to Robert Maxwell, I went to meet him at Heathrow Airport and travelled into town with him. I was a young financial journalist. When we got to the Savoy Hotel, he went up to reception to sign in. As soon as he was given his room number, he demanded that he be given a different room. I asked him why. You see, he said, I fear that my room will have been bugged. \n \n Even then phone hacking and electronic eavesdropping obsessed him. Now they will be his undoing and Section 79 could be his final reckoning. \n \n a.whittamsmith@independent.co.uk",

Generally speaking, prosecutions will only run where the prosecutors are convinced they\u2019ll be able to persuade the jury beyond all reasonable doubt that the guy had his hands all over this.\" Murdoch himself has not been accused in the scandal, but former News International exec Rebekah Brooks, who became editor of the now-shuttered paper in 2002, is widely expected to be fired. \u2013 Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks is facing calls to resign over the phone hacking scandal, but Rupert Murdoch's son says her \"leadership and her standard of ethics and her standards of conduct is very good.\" In an interview with the BBC, James Murdoch said he was satisfied with Brooks' leadership. \"I am satisfied that ReBekah\u2014her leadership and her Standard of Ethics and her Standards of Conduct\u2014is very good,\" he said. In an op-ed in the New York Times, former News Corp. executive Tom Mockridge calls for action to be taken against News International executives and accuses the company of \"systematically invades people's privacy through phone hacking, corrupts the police by making large payments to individual officers, and compromises fair trials as a result of publishing reports that are likely to prejudice juries.\" He warns that if action isn't taken now, \"worrisome will follow.\" \u2013 The phone hacking scandal has brought Rupert Murdoch's media empire to its knees, but he's not resigning as CEO of News International\u2014at least not yet. Rebekah Brooks, who headed up News of the World before becoming chief executive of Fox News, isn't resigning because she didn't know about the phone hacking, but because she is a courtier, writes Adam Smith in the Independent. Courtiers don't resign. They stay or go at the monarch's pleasure. And while it may be difficult for company lawyers to understand a monarchical organization, judges should do so\u2014for they are, after all, \"Her Majesty's Judges.\" \"Whether Mr. Murdoch falls under this rubric would be for a court to decide,\" Smith writes. \"But I have no doubt that Mr Murdoch does act as if he were a director or a manager.\"",

    "document": "About 350 U.S. newspapers published editorials Thursday (Aug. 16) as part of a coordinated effort to defend the freedom of the press and chastise President Donald Trump for constantly bashing news organizations as \"enemies of the people.\" \n \n The initiative was organized by Boston Globe op-ed page editor Marjorie Pritchard, who called for editorial voices nationwide to unite against the president's rhetoric, which some fear will incite physical violence against reporters and others working at media outlets. \n \n \"Our words will differ,\" Pritchard said. \"But at least we can agree that such attacks are alarming.\" \n \n The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it's TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division & distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous & sick! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2018 \n \n \"We're not the enemy of the people,\" Pritchard said in an interview this week. \"We thought that a coordinated effort across the country would make a powerful statement about the importance of a free press.\" \n \n The Globe and The New York Times were the biggest names to join a list that also included the Houston Chronicle, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Miami Herald and the Denver Post. \n \n The NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune editorial board chose not to participate. We believe a local news organization's voice should be independent. And we believe our work, and the president's attacks on the press, speak for themselves. \n \n Not everyone in the media agrees with the Globe's strategy. Politico reporter Jack Shafer pointed out that an allegedly independent press all engaged in \"groupthink\" will only reaffirm the worst opinions that many people already share. \n \n \"Most journalists agree that there's a great need for Trump rebuttals,\" Shafer writes. \"But this Globe-sponsored coordinated editorial response is sure to backfire: It will provide Trump with circumstantial evidence of the existence of a national press cabal that has been convened solely to oppose him.\" \n \n Trump's forthcoming speeches almost write themselves, Shafer says: \"By colluding against me, the fake media proved once and for all, that they are in cahoots with the Democrats and have declared themselves to be my true political opposition ... \" for example. \n \n The Boston Globe, which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses & investment), or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS, was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR. Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press. PROVE IT! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2018 \n \n Many of the newspapers are not just singing from the same hymnals but also preaching to the choir. Most, if not all of these newspapers, either endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016 or made a show of their disgust by not endorsing at all. \n \n This endeavor seems likely to have the same impact. \n \n The very legitimate defenses of the First Amendment and the importance of a free and independent press are certain to get swallowed up in the partisan divide and the strong feelings of many that Trump never gets a fair shake from the mainstream media. \n \n There also is the issue of the \"Trump bump,\" the increase in circulation enjoyed by some outlets, most notably The New York Times, for the aggressive news coverage and editorial opposition to the president and his administration. \n \n So, it wasn't the greatest look that three paragraphs into its online editorial, The Boston Globe included an ad that says: \"Our subscribers support a free press. Please join that effort. Subscribe now.\" \n \n The Globe editorial, under the headline \"Journalists are NOT the enemy,\" concludes: \n \n \"Lies are antithetical to an informed citizenry, responsible for self-governance. The greatness of America is dependent on the role of a free press to speak the truth to the powerful. To label the press 'the enemy of the people' is as un-American as it is dangerous to the civic compact we have shared for more than two centuries.\" \n \n The New York Times editorial, headlined \"A Free Press Needs You,\" begins with a brief history of the beginnings of the idea of a free press, then notes: \n \n \"In 2018, some of the most damaging attacks are coming from government officials. Criticizing the news media -- for underplaying or overplaying stories, for getting something wrong -- is entirely right. News reporters and editors are human, and make mistakes. Correcting them is core to our job. But insisting that truths you don't like are 'fake news' is dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy. And calling journalists the 'enemy of the people' is dangerous, period.\" \n \n The editorial concludes: \n \n \"If you haven't already, please subscribe to your local papers. Praise them when you think they've done a good job and criticize them when you think they could do better. We're all in this together.\" \n \n Yes, but we all also need to think for ourselves and arrive at our own conclusions.

He can be reached at tmorris@nola.com. Follow him on Twitter @tmorris504. ||||| [Read The New York Times editorial here.] \n \n Speaking to reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump briefly alluded to the editorials. \n \n \u201cIf you\u2019d like, you can stay. If you\u2019d like, you can leave,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cFreedom of the press.\u201d \n \n The Senate on Thursday passed a resolution in support of press freedoms, which included an affirmation \u201cthat the press is not the enemy of the people.\u201d \n \n Mr. Trump took a swipe at The Globe by noting that The New York Times Company had sold the paper at a steep loss, though he incorrectly said that the price had been $1. The Times Company sold The Globe and other properties for $70 million in 2013, after having paid $1.1 billion two decades before. \n \n The president\u2019s tweets came a day after the White House announced that Mr. Trump had taken the unprecedented step of revoking the security clearance of one of his biggest critics, John O. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A. Mr. Brennan said the president\u2019s action was an attempt to silence him and a warning to others who speak out against him and his administration\u2019s policies. ||||| News Bias: The Boston Globe had the great idea to get 100 newspapers around the country to publish editorials Thursday to \"push back\" against President Trump for his critical remarks about the press. In doing so, they've only confirmed that he is dead right. \n \n X \n \n The idea is to counterbalance Trump's effective recent jabs at the press for their \"fake news\" and his clearly inflammatory remark that the news media are the \"enemy of the people.\" \n \n \"We have some big newspapers, but the majority are from smaller markets, all enthusiastic about standing up to Trump's assault on journalism,\" Marjorie Pritchard, the Globe's deputy editorial page editor, told CNN. \n \n Though the number of participating newspapers was initially estimated at 100, it now appears it will be about 70. Still, that's a lot. And even the American Society of Newspaper Editors has disgraced itself by supporting it. \n \n Get the new IBD Politics & Opinion newsletter! \n \n That so many news outlets could be duped into participating in what is obviously a political stunt is not only disappointing but disturbing. It suggests their real agenda isn't informing people, even in their editorials, but bending the news to suit a leftist political agenda. \n \n The irony, of course, is that in participating in this Antifa-inspired mob action, the media are proving what Trump says is true. They are biased. \n \n What's called \"fake news\" comes in many forms, such as reporting something that isn't true or that lacks proof. \n \n In recent days, for instance, coverage of Omarosa Manigault-Newman's scathing book on working for Trump, \"Unhinged: An Insider Account of the Trump White House,\" has been all over the media. She claims a tape exists of Trump using an ugly racial epithet on the reality show \"The Apprentice.\" Many media accounts cite it. \n \n Fair enough. Where is it? Can we hear it or see it? Apparently not. Does it exist? If it does, no one's brought it forward. \n \n Yet, Newman does have surreptitiously recorded tape of White House aide John Kelly quite justifiably firing her, and another recorded bit of a private conversation she had with a sympathetic President Trump in which he said he was \"sad\" to see her go. That beast! \n \n Trump \"unhinged?\" Fake news. \n \n Meanwhile, a sinister and frightening extremist Islamist religious movement in New Mexico allegedly instructs children how to engage in mass terrorist shootings, and the national media virtually ignore it. And its leader is the son and namesake of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the imam of Brooklyn, N.Y.'s At-Taqwa Mosque, who has extensive ties to the Democratic Party. \n \n The media's response? Crickets. \n \n As we noted recently, the bias has even permeated the media's coverage of the economy. The media are seriously misinforming the public about what's happening in the economy \u2014 and why. \n \n \"The stronger the economy gets under Trump, the more desperate his critics are to hand credit over to Obama,\" we wrote last week in an editorial about the media's economic blind spots when it comes to Trumponomics. \"A recent New York Times story says it all: 'An economic upturn begun under Obama is now Trump's to tout.' \" \n \n Getting The Economy Wrong, Too \n \n We can't blame only the Times. Many in the media now ascribe recent major gains in economic activity that are clearly related to Trump policy changes to President Obama. It's as perverse as it is wrong. And it is a matter of statistical fact that Obama, whatever else you think of him, had the worst economic record of any president since the Great Depression. \n \n He inherited an economy ripe for a major rebound after the financial crisis and instead delivered eight years of mediocre gains. \n \n These are but two of the recently misreported or underreported stories propagated by the so-called mainstream media. Our major media are in fact filled with left-leaning reporters and editors who refuse to acknowledge their obvious bias \u2014 or when they do acknowledge it, deny it has any bearing on their reporting. When challenged, they wrap themselves in the First Amendment and pretend to be martyrs. \n \n Trump knows this. He's basically trolled the media to get them to explicitly show their anti-Trump bias. It worked like a charm.

Such a spectacle will unfold on Thursday, August 16, as 200 or more editorial pages will heed the call sounded by Boston Globe op-ed page editor Marjorie Pritchard to run editorials opposing President Donald Trump\u2019s unrelieved press-bashing. Participating dailies include the Houston Chronicle, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Miami Herald and the Denver Post, as well as the Globe. Joining the movement are the American Society of News Editors and the New England Newspaper and Press Association. Dan Rather is on board, as is the Radio Television Digital News Association. \n \n \u201cOur words will differ. But at least we can agree that such attacks are alarming,\u201d Pritchard\u2019s appeal declared. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n It goes without saying that press bashing, Trump-style, is alarming. His critiques rarely point to genuine inaccuracies in the press. Instead, his method is to dismiss any news that impedes his agenda or disparages him as fake and dishonest. With demagogic bluster, he routinely deploys \u201cenemies of the people\u201d rhetoric against journalists, which some say has inspired physical threats against journalists. Early this month, he tweeted that reporters are \u201cdangerous & sick\u201d and accused them of causing war (!) and purposely causing \u201cgreat division & distrust.\u201d Early in his presidency, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.\u201d \n \n Most journalists agree that there\u2019s a great need for Trump rebuttals. I\u2019ve written my share. But this Globe-sponsored coordinated editorial response is sure to backfire: It will provide Trump with circumstantial evidence of the existence of a national press cabal that has been convened solely to oppose him. When the editorials roll off the press on Thursday, all singing from the same script, Trump will reap enough fresh material to whale on the media for at least a month. His forthcoming speeches almost write themselves: By colluding against me, the fake media proved once and for all, that they are in cahoots with the Democrats and have declared themselves to be my true political opposition \u2026 \n \n The Globe\u2019s anti-Trump project is also an exercise in redundancy, not to mention self-stroking. Most newspapers have already published a multitude of editorials and columns rebuking the president for his trash-talking of the press. Most major editorial boards opposed Trump\u2019s election, according to this tally by Business Insider. The largest of the 19 newspapers to endorse Trump was the Las Vegas Review-Journal, owned by one of his faithful donors, Sheldon Adelson. More than 240 endorsed Hillary Clinton. Editorial-page sentiment against Trump remains largely unchanged since the election, making the call for a collective reprimand all the more pointless. \n \n Another problem with a nationally coordinated pro-press catechism is that the audience likely to reap the greatest benefit from the haranguing\u2014Trump and many in his base\u2014tends not to read newspapers in the first place. While there\u2019s always value in preaching to the choir\u2014that\u2019s why churches hold services every Sunday\u2014the combined weight of 200 pro-press editorials is not likely to move the opinion needle or deter Trump from defaming and threatening reporters. \n \n Most newspaper editorials are already a watered-down product of groupthink. It\u2019s unlikely that expanding the size of the group and encouraging everybody to bake and serve a tuna-fish casserole on the same day will produce editorials that are more interesting and persuasive than the normal fare. \n \n But maybe I\u2019m wrong. If a single day of pro-press editorials is a good idea for a collective assignment, then maybe newspapers should set aside next Saturday for 200 editorials on tariffs and next Sunday for 200 editorials on global warming and next Monday for 200 editorials on Afghanistan. Surely these issues are as compelling and urgent as press freedom. \n \n For all its faults, the American press refuses the commands from critics who would have it operate like some monolithic entity. Almost daily, our best newspapers express their independence by rejecting the marching orders issued by corporations, politicians and governments. Editorial pages of America, don\u2019t unite! Think for yourselves! Reject this stupid pro-press assignment! \n \n ****** \n \n Send collective assignments to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com. I will ignore them.

Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press. PROVE IT!\" Trump tweeted Thursday, adding, \"There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants, but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS, pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS!\" Earlier Thursday, he had tweeted, \"THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country....BUT WE ARE WINNING!\" The New York Times notes that Trump's first tweet contained a factual error; the Times Company paid $1.1 billion for the Boston Globe and other properties decades ago, then sold them for $70 million in 2013. But an editorial at Investor's Business Daily Wednesday was on Trump's side, and even used the same charged c-word in its headline: \"Editorial Collusion By Dozens Of Newspapers Proves Trump's Point: The Media Are Biased.\" It calls the move by the newspapers (CNN lists some of those that participated) a \"political stunt\" that shows the papers are more interested in pushing a left-wing agenda than actually informing the public. And at Politico, Jack Shafer says the plan \"played right into Trump's hands\" and will surely backfire, despite Trump's attacks on the press being truly \"alarming\" and deserving of a rebuttal. At NOLA.com Tim Morris echoes that, noting that the Times-Picayune editorial board did not participate because \"we believe a local news organization's voice should be independent. ...

    "document": "Pathological gambling, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping are some of the abnormal behaviors that are linked to the use of certain drugs commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease, according to a new study. \n \n The findings are important because they mean that doctors and patients should be wary of the drugs' side effects, according to the study authors. But they also give researchers a better understanding of how abnormal behaviors develop in general, and how such behaviors may be related to the brain receptor that is targeted by the drug, the authors said. \n \n \"In our view, these medications should be used less frequently and with great caution, paying close attention to possible untoward effects on behavior and impulse control,\" said Dr. Howard D. Weiss of Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and Dr. Gregory M. Pontone of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, writing in an editorial about the new study. \n \n In the study, the researchers examined 1,580 reports of people in the United States and 21 other countries experiencing pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping or other abnormal behaviors after taking medication between 2003 and 2012. They found that 710 of the cases occurred in people taking drugs called dopamine receptor agonists, which are used to treat Parkinson's disease, whereas the other 870 cases occurred in people taking all of the other types of drugs combined. \n \n The researchers determined that the proportion of such reports was 277.6 times higher for people taking dopamine agonist receptor drugs than those taking other drugs. [7 Bizarre Drug Side Effects] \n \n Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that normally helps regulate movement, emotions and the feelings of pleasure. In people with Parkinson's disease, the brain cells that make dopamine die over time. Dopamine receptor agonists are used to mimic the function of the neurotransmitter. \n \n The important step to take after the new findings is to introduce warnings about the potential side effects of those drugs so that doctors who prescribe them are aware of them, said study author Thomas J. Moore, a senior scientist at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in Alexandria, Virginia. \n \n \"They [doctors and caregivers of Parkinson's patients] need to be on the lookout for this kind of behavior\" and understand it may be linked to the use of medication, Moore told Live Science. \n \n Of all the cases of abnormal behavior that were observed in the people taking the drugs for Parkinson's disease, the majority (410 cases) occurred in those who had been taking a dopamine receptor agonist drug called pramipexole, which affects a receptor called dopamine D3 receptor. And the drug that was second-most commonly linked to such behaviors was ropinirole, which also has a significant effect on the D3 receptor, according to the study, published today (Oct. 20) in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine \n \n The researchers noted that in some cases, the people taking these drugs had restless leg syndrome (not Parkinson's disease). \n \n The new research may allow researchers to better understand how abnormal behaviors develop, and how they may be related to the D3 receptor, Moore said. The D3 receptor has also been investigated as a possible target for treatments for people with addictions, the researchers wrote in the study. \n \n In another study, published in July 2011 in the journal Physiology & Behavior, other researchers also found a link between behaviors such as hypersexuality or excessive gambling and the use of the two drugs that Moore found to be the most closely related to abnormal behaviors in the new study. \n \n Drugs for Parkinson's have been down this road before. In the 1960s, the introduction of the Parkinson's drug levodopa enabled Parkinson's patients to \u201cregain function and return to the mainstream of life,\" Weiss and Pontone wrote. \n \n Levodopa gets converted into dopamine in the brain, said Weiss and Pontone, who were not involved with the new research. \n \n However, enthusiasm for that treatment was tempered when patients taking it developed involuntary muscle movements, similar to tics, and in rare cases also developing abnormal behaviors such as hypersexuality, they wrote. \n \n The newer class of Parkinson's drugs \u2014 the dopamine receptor agonist drugs \u2014 act differently in the brain, Weiss and Pontone wrote. Levodopa gets converted into dopamine in the brain, the dopamine receptor agonist drugs just mimic the neurotransmitter's effects. \n \n It was known that the dopamine receptor agonist drugs caused side effects such as hallucinations, psychosis and excessive daytime sleepiness. But despite these effects, the drugs remain widely used, and it is only recently that doctors started recognizing a link between the use of those drugs and the occurrence of impulse control disorders with symptoms such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality and uncontrollable spending, Weiss and Pontone wrote. \n \n It is not surprising that it took a while for doctors to start recognizing the link between the two, they wrote, as they did not routinely inquire about the potentially behavior-altering effects of the drugs. \n \n \"During an office visit, a patient is unlikely to spontaneously mention, 'By the way, doctor, I lost $250,000 in casinos last year, and I purchase $500 of lottery tickets every week' or 'I spend all night on Internet pornography sites and am soliciting prostitutes,'\" Weiss and Pontone noted. \n \n \"In summary, physicians have overestimated the benefit and underestimated the risks associated with the use of dopamine receptor agonist drugs in patients with Parkinson disease,\" they wrote. \n \n Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Treatments \n \n Parkinson's Drugs Can Be A Gateway To Sin \n \n i itoggle caption ImageZoo/Corbis ImageZoo/Corbis \n \n Drugs that are commonly prescribed to help people cope with Parkinson's disease have been linked to bizarre changes in behavior that patients and doctors should be on guard against, researchers say. \n \n The disturbing side effects include compulsive gambling, uncontrollable shopping and a sudden obsession with sex. \n \n The problems with the drugs, called dopamine agonists, are serious enough that the researchers say the Food and Drug Administration should require the medicines to carry what's called a black-box warning, one of the most prominent and serious cautions used for prescriptions drugs. \n \n Some of the drugs are also prescribed for restless leg syndrome and hyperprolactinemia, a hormonal condition that can trigger milk production. \n \n While the problems with the dopamine agonists have been noted in the past, the recommendation for a more prominent warning comes come after researchers sifted through 2.7 million reports of drug reactions submitted to an FDA database between 2003 and 2012. \n \n The researchers from the Institute for Safe Medicine Practices, Harvard and the University of Ottawa found 1,580 adverse drug events involving impulse control disorders. A little less than half, or 710 reports, were associated with dopamine receptor agonist drugs. \n \n The link was strongest for pramipexole, brand name Mirapex, and ropinirole, brand name Requip. The instructions for doctors who are thinking about prescribing Mirapex already carry a warning that says patients taking the medicine \"may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges.\" Requip, a treatment for restless leg syndrome. \n \n The results were published online Monday by JAMA Internal Medicine. \n \n Back in 2005, doctors from the Mayo Clinic reported 11 cases of patients who became compulsive gamblers after taking dopamine agonists. A 52-year-old man lost $100,000 in casinos after previously gambling only once in his life. He also became fixated on pornography and obsessed with sex, carrying on extramarital affairs. A month after stopping the drug, he was his old self. \n \n Doctors and patients may have overlooked the problems. In a commentary accompanying the latest findings, two Johns Hopkins doctors wrote that nausea, dizziness and other physical side effects are more typical parts of the conversations between doctors and patients about drugs. \"During an office visit, a patient is unlikely to spontaneously mention, 'By the way, doctor I lost $250,000 in casinos last week' or 'I spend all night on Internet pornography sites and am soliciting prostitutes,' \" they wrote. \n \n Neurologist Howard Weiss, a co-author of the commentary, tells Shots that these drug-related compulsive behaviors haven't gotten the attention in the medical community that they deserve. A heightened warning in the drugs' instructions could help make the risk clearer, Weiss says. The behavioral problems, he says, \"are more important than 99 percent of the other side effects that are being listed.\" \n \n Weiss says he's had at least three patients who have lost their homes because of bankruptcy after taking the drugs. \n \n When he asked an elderly patients taking one of the drugs if she ever gambled, she replied, \"Gambling is the work of the devil.\" But it turned out she had been buying hundreds of dollars' worth of lottery tickets a week, a habit she didn't consider to be gambling. \n \n Weiss says the behavioral problems usually go away after patients stop taking the medicines. He also says the drug combination carbidopa-levodopa, another Parkinson's treatment, works better and doesn't increase the risk for impulsive behavior. ||||| Importance Severe impulse control disorders involving pathological gambling, hypersexuality, and compulsive shopping have been reported in association with the use of dopamine receptor agonist drugs in case series and retrospective patient surveys. These agents are used to treat Parkinson disease, restless leg syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. \n \n Objectives To analyze serious adverse drug event reports about these impulse control disorders received by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to assess the relationship of these case reports with the 6 FDA-approved dopamine receptor agonist drugs. \n \n Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a retrospective disproportionality analysis based on the 2.7 million serious domestic and foreign adverse drug event reports from 2003 to 2012 extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. \n \n Main Outcomes and Measures Cases were selected if they contained any of 10 preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that described the abnormal behaviors. We used the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) to compare the proportion of target events to all serious events for the study drugs with a similar proportion for all other drugs. \n \n Results We identified 1580 events indicating impulse control disorders from the United States and 21 other countries:710 fordopamine receptor agonist drugs and 870 for other drugs. The dopamine receptor agonist drugs had a strong signal associated with these impulse control disorders (n = 710; PRR = 277.6, P < .001). The association was strongest for the dopamine agonists pramipexole (n = 410; PRR = 455.9, P < .001) and ropinirole (n = 188; PRR = 152.5, P < .001), with preferential affinity for the dopamine D 3 receptor. A signal was also seen for aripiprazole, an antipsychotic classified as a partial agonist of the D 3 receptor (n = 37; PRR = 8.6, P < .001). \n \n Conclusions and Relevance Our findings confirm and extend the evidence that dopamine receptor agonist drugs are associated with these specific impulse control disorders. At present, none of the dopamine receptor agonist drugs approved by the FDA have boxed warnings as part of their prescribing information. Our data, and data from prior studies, show the need for more prominent warnings.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Parkinson's drugs are known for a range of side effects, including hallucinations, psychosis, and extreme drowsiness. But researchers say there's also a clear link between the use of some of these drugs and impulse control issues that result in hypersexuality, compulsive gambling, and uncontrollable spending, reports LiveScience. Looking at 1,580 reports of people in 22 countries, including the US, who'd experienced these abnormal behaviors after taking meds between 2003 and 2012, they identified 710 cases that involve dopamine receptor agonists, drugs often used to treat Parkinson's disease. (The other 870 cases accounted for all other types of drugs combined.) \"Physicians have overestimated the benefit and underestimated the risks associated with the use of dopamine receptor agonist drugs in patients with [Parkinson's] disease,\" the researchers write in JAMA Internal Medicine. One of the writers says three of his patients have lost their homes because they went bankrupt after taking the drugs, reports NPR. The link was strongest for pramipexole (brand name Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip). Because people taking this type of drug were 277 times more likely to report these impulsive behaviors than those taking other drugs, the researchers are calling for black-box warnings\u2014reserved for the most extreme cautions\u2014detailing the risks involved. (One woman has even reported her Parkinson's meds give her three to five unwanted orgasms daily.)",

Scanpix Denmark/Ida Marie Odgaard/via REUTERS \n \n A Danish inventor charged with murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall in his home-made submarine had video footage on his computer showing women being violently killed, a court heard on Tuesday. \n \n A police prosecutor said officers found images \u201cwhich we presume to be real\u201d of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on Peter Madsen\u2019s computer in a laboratory he ran. \n \n That, together with new post-mortem evidence showing Wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals \u201caround or shortly after her death,\u201d was adding to the case against Madsen, the prosecutor, Jakob Buch-Jepsen, told the Copenhagen court. \n \n DNA tests from Madsen\u2019s nails, face and neck showed a clear match with Wall\u2019s, Buch-Jepsen said, though the exact cause of death remained unknown. \u201cOur suspicion hasn\u2019t changed, it has been strengthened since (the last hearing on) September 5,\u201d he added. \n \n Madsen, who denies murdering Wall and another charge of mutilating her body, appeared in court via video link dressed in a green boilersuit. \n \n He said the computer searched by police was not his. \u201cThey are the space laboratory\u2019s tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory,\u201d he said.

If you want to call that pressure, fine. I call it conversation \u2014 Ben Horowitz (@bhorowitz) May 27, 2014 \n \n Whatever the case, it was a definitely a bridge too far \u2014 especially after the entire group of founders has already wallowed in a number of controversial issues, calling attention more to their idiotic hijinks than to their business. \n \n Here is Moghadam\u2019s apology on Twitter: \n \n I want to apologize to everyone. I need to hear these criticisms, reflect for real, and work on becoming a better person \u2014 Mahbod (@mahbodmoghadam) May 26, 2014 \n \n And here\u2019s Lehman\u2019s whole statement: ||||| Rap Genius cofounder Mahbod Moghadam resigned from both the company and its board of directors, effective immediately, after leaving inappropriate annotations on the manifesto by Elliot Rodgers, the alleged Santa Barbara shooter. \n \n In response to questions from Valleywag yesterday, Moghadam apologized about the bizarre and disturbing commentary he left on Rodger's horrifying manifesto. Rap Genius allows anyone to annotate a snippet to text. In his explanations, Moghadam applauded Rodger's writing and commented on the attractiveness of Rodger's sister. Before it was removed, one annotation said: \"MY GUESS: his sister is smokin hot\" \n \n Before the resignation, Moghadam told Valleywag: \n \n I was fascinated by the fact that a text was associated with such a heartbreaking crime, especially since Elliot is talking about my neighborhood growing up I got carried away with making the annotations and making any comment about his sister was in horrible taste, thankfully the rap genius community edits out my poor judgement, I am very sorry for writing it \n \n Re/code has the full statement from CEO and cofounder Tom Lehman. Moghadam, Lehman, and a third cofounder, Ilan Zechory, were all classmates at Yale University. They raised $16 million from Andreessen Horowitz, the storied Silicon Valley venture capital firm, to expand their website annotating hip hop lyrics into the \"Internet Talmud\" by crowd-sourcing explanations for poetry, music, legal documents, classic literature, and the news. \n \n When I first met the cofounders in the fall of 2012 at their Williamsburg penthouse, Moghadam told me that Rap Genius planned to make money through advertising and merchandise. But since raising $16 million, the startup has mostly made trouble for its benefactor Ben Horowitz, who also sits on the company's board. \n \n Horowitz is known for starting his blog posts about leadership and finance with rap lyrics and brought the company to Marc Andreessen's attention. The firm managed to stay silent on Moghadam's antics in the past, including tweeting \"I'mma rape you in your mouth cuz\" to a music critic at Spin magazine. \n \n Moghadam also told Mark Zuckerberg to \"Suck his dick\" after the Facebook CEO objected to Instagram photos of an evening at Horowitz's house. The rapper Nas, a friend of Horowitz, was also present that night.) After these regularly recurring outburst, Moghadam tends to issue an effusive apology. Last October, he blamed the last of impulse control on a brain tumor which has since been removed. \n \n Moghadam's departure from the board is strong signal that Rap Genius and its investors want to distance themselves from that kind of behavior, which they have previously brushed off as some kind of swaggy performance art. But Moghadam hasn't been the only source of bad press. Around Christmas, Google severely punished Rap Genius for using spammy SEO tactics to get its content at the top of the search engine. \n \n In that case, however, it was an email from Moghadam that spilled the startup's SEO secret. Moghadam promised a fellow Y Combinator alum \"MASSIVE traffic,\" if he embedded Rap Genius links about Justin Bieber's new album in the bottom of a post. Google began its investigation into Rap Genius shortly after Moghadam's solicitous email was published. \n \n Here is the memo from Lehman about Moghadam's resignation: \n \n Yesterday the Rap Genius community annotated Elliot Rodger's manifesto on News Genius. Because this tragedy is still so raw, there was internal debate as to whether this document belonged on the site at all. Ultimately we decided that it was worthy of close reading \u2013 understanding the psychology of people who do horrible things can help us to better understand our society and ourselves. The current version of the annotated document is far from great, but the hope is that the annotations will improve over time as the story unfolds and it will eventually be a good resource for people looking to understand this tragedy. Almost all the annotations were at least attempting a close reading \u2013 they were genuinely, though imperfectly, trying to add context to the text and make it easier to understand. However, Mahbod Moghadam, one of my co-founders, annotated the piece with annotations that not only didn't attempt to enhance anyone's understanding of the text, but went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny. All of which is contrary to everything we're trying to accomplish at Rap Genius. Were Mahbod's annotations posted by a new Rap Genius user, it would be up to our community leaders, who set the tone of the site and our approach to annotation, to delete them and explain to the new user why they were unacceptable. Were Mahbod's annotations posted by a Rap Genius moderator, that person would cease to be an effective community leader and would have to step down. And Mahbod, our original community leader, is no exception. In light of this, Mahbod has resigned \u2013 both in his capacity as an employee of the company, and as a member of our board of directors, effective immediately. Mahbod is my friend. He's a brilliant, creative, complicated person with a ton of love in his heart. Without Mahbod Rap Genius would not exist, and I am grateful for all he has done to help Rap Genius succeed. But I cannot let him compromise the Rap Genius mission \u2013 a mission that remains almost as delicate and inchoate as it was when we three founders decided to devote our lives to it almost 5 years ago. Tom Lehman \n \n Co-Founder & CEO \n \n After the news broke, Moghadam seemed contrite: \n \n I want to apologize to everyone. I need to hear these criticisms, reflect for real, and work on becoming a better person \u2014 Mabode (@mahbodmoghadam) May 26, 2014 \n \n Update: Horowitz said the decision was made by Moghadam's cofounder, Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory. His tweet indicates that it was more of a forced directive than a resignation. \n \n . @semil @MikeIsaac @RapGenius this was all Tom and Ilan not me. They made the hard decision. \u2014 bhorowitz (@bhorowitz) May 26, 2014 \n \n This post has been updated to include more information and to note Moghadam's role in the SEO investigation.

Snowball Fight Association. The group had planned a big showdown in DuPont Circle, where a few years ago 3,000 people turned out for a humdinger of a fight. \n \n But where 5 to 10 inches of wet snow was supposed to fall on DuPont Circle, not even slush was accumulating Wednesday afternoon, said organizer Michael Lipin. \n \n \"Quite a letdown,\" he said. \n \n While the storm was dumping plenty of snow in other places, Washington was getting just fractions of an inch, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. \n \n JUST WATCHED Snowstorm marches east Replay More Videos ...

Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency, state police extended shifts and the National Guard called up 100 troops for snow duty as inches of wet, heavy snow fell across parts of the state. \n \n Authorities opened shelters for the 215,000 Virginians without power, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. \n \n Transportation officials reported particularly nasty conditions on many secondary and some primary routes in 15 central and northern counties, with deep snow or ice covering the pavement. State and many county offices closed early. \n \n About 4,200 utility workers were in the field trying to deal with outages, Rodney Blevins of Dominion Power said during a news conference. \n \n How do you really feel about the snow? \n \n Airlines canceled more than 1,600 flights, leaving passengers such as Alex Thompson, who had hoped to take a flight to San Francisco, with plenty of time on their hands. \n \n Thompson traveled all the way from Kenya only to find that his next flight was one of hundreds called off until Thursday because of the storm. \n \n With no hotel reservations and nowhere else to go, he said he'd find a place to sack out at Dulles International Airport and \"waste my time until I can get on my flight.\" \n \n Capital closings \n \n The dire forecast issued Tuesday prompted the federal government to close offices in the nation's capital, but emergency workers and telecommuters were expected to be on duty, according to the Office of Personnel Management. \n \n The White House canceled a planned celebration for the Alabama Crimson Tide, college football champions, and Congress called off several hearings. \n \n More than 954,000 students who attend major school districts in Washington, Virginia, Maryland and Ohio got the day off. \n \n Amtrak shut down some trains in Washington, Virginia, West Virginia and New York. \n \n Track the late-winter storm \n \n But tourism goes on \n \n Not all of Washington was shut down. Although the National Zoo was closed, the Smithsonian said its museums would be open for visitors. \n \n Washington's Metrorail system was running, although some bus service was disrupted, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. \n \n Flooding threat \n \n Along the coast, the problem wasn't snow, but high winds and the threat of flooding. \n \n The National Weather Service issued coastal flood warnings for parts of Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. \n \n Officials in parts of New Jersey suggested residents evacuate from flood-prone areas along the coast, including areas still recovering from damage done by Hurricane Sandy in October, according to CNN affiliate WABC. \n \n A flood warning was in effect through Friday morning for the eastern coast of Massachusetts based on a \"high confidence\" for high winds, storm surge, and moderate to major coastal flooding, the state's emergency management agency said. \n \n About 300 National Guard troops will be used along the Massachusetts coast to help with flooding and possible evacuations, agency spokesman Peter Judge said. \n \n Fifty Delaware National Guard troops were called up as emergency management officials urged some coastal residents in that state to evacuate, saying flooding would cut off exit routes. The agency warned of almost certain flooding in areas and said \"conditions during the height of the storm could make the process of leaving flooded areas dangerous or impossible.\" \n \n High winds forced the brief closure of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in both directions, Maryland authorities said, but not before a tractor trailer overturned on one end, CNN affiliate WJZ reported. \n \n Wind was believed to have been a major factor in the accident. \n \n Power was out across the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, Delmarva Power reported. \n \n In coastal Sussex County, the 911 center reported numerous calls for wires down, vehicle accidents and trees down. \n \n Water breached a sand dune in Sussex County, forcing the closure of State Route 1 in the county, according to DEMA. \n \n Is the snow helping ease drought? \n \n Midwest recovering \n \n The storm is the same one that earlier dumped about a foot of snow in parts of Illinois, Minnesota and North Dakota, paving a white swath across the Upper Midwest. \n \n Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had 6 inches of snow Tuesday, beating a 1999 record for the date by 2.2 inches. It was the first snowfall of 6 inches or more in the Windy City since February 2011, the weather service said. \n \n Plows removed snow from roads and trucks spread salt and sand, but drivers still slipped off of roadways, leaving snow-covered cars to be retrieved by tow trucks. \n \n Tuesday's snow put a drag on air traffic in the Midwest, leading to delays and cancellations, but planes continued to fly in Columbus, Ohio, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, after plows removed the snow from runways. \n \n Analyze the snowfall",

Had his wife not asked him to step outside, he would have missed it, too. \n \n \u201cWe were basically just crossing exactly where it was at the time,\u201d Melvaer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a stroke of luck.

Coast Guardsmen initially found it floating 67 miles off the coast of Daytona Beach two days after the Tequesta teens disappeared. They attached a data marker buoy to it and continued searching for the boys, but the device failed. When they went to retrieve the boat, it was gone. \n \n The boat is now packed in a shipping container and expected to arrive May 16 at Port Everglades. Its contents \u2014 Austin\u2019s iPhone, two fishing rods and two small tackle boxes \u2014 have been returned to the families. The phone could offer clues to their disappearance if the family wants to pursue them. \n \n Melvaer said Sunday that after spotting the boat, the crew hoisted it on board to remove it from the shipping lane, a standard practice. The boat was intact and had a serial number on the engine, so he notified the Coast Guard. \n \n In the meantime, he wondered about the boat and its crew. \n \n \u201cI went up to my office and basically Googled \u2018missing fisherman,\u2019 I think, and it (Austin and Perry\u2019s story) came up as one of the first ones,\u201d he said. \n \n He had never heard of the boys, but when the Coast Guard confirmed his suspicion and asked him to send photos, Melvaer was stunned.

They had the same reaction. They felt that it was important to get this properly done and try not to do extra damage.\u201d \n \n Since he started training at age 17, he\u2019s only twice run across abandoned vessels in the water \u2014 one time the bow of a boat off the coast of India, and a second time a downed helicopter he happened to be searching for. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not something that happens every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at sea, things have a tendency to blend in.\u201d \n \n Melvaer declined to discuss particular details about the boat or its contents, citing the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission investigation and concern for the boys\u2019 families. He wouldn\u2019t say whether Austin\u2019s cellphone was in usable condition. \n \n His hope is that the chance discovery might bring some peace to the families. \n \n \u201cLet\u2019s hope that this leads to something good,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, nothing can ever replace what\u2019s lost.

    "document": "By Lucy Morgan, Times Senior Correspondent \n \n In Print: Thursday, July 26, 2012 \n \n TALLAHASSEE \u2014 In a wide-ranging deposition that spanned two days in late May, former Florida Republican Party chairman Jim Greer denounced some party officials as liars and \"whack-a-do, right-wing crazies'' as he described turmoil in the months before his resignation. \n \n Greer said some GOP leaders were meeting to discuss ways they could suppress black votes while others were constantly scheming against each other. \n \n He blamed criminal fraud charges filed against him in 2010 on legislative leaders and other party officials who he says orchestrated an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the statewide grand jury to avoid paying him money he was due. \n \n His statements were in response to questions from lawyers for the party, Senate President Mike Haridopolos and Sen. John Thrasher. Greer has filed a lawsuit against the party and the two officials in an attempt to collect $130,000 he was promised in a written agreement shortly before he resigned. The lawsuit, pending in Leon County, is unlikely to be resolved until after a criminal trial scheduled for mid November. \n \n Copies of the 630-page deposition and other documents were released by statewide prosecutors Wednesday. \n \n Greer's testimony offers a window into the level of animosity that exists between Greer and the party he once ran. \n \n \u2022 Greer said \"the party was in turmoil\" as officials wanted to get rid of him and former Gov. Charlie Crist because they disagreed with some of Crist's decisions, including the appointment of a liberal African-American judge to the Florida Supreme Court, Crist's endorsement of John McCain for president in 2008 and the hug Crist gave President Barack Obama in 2009. \"My phone lit up with people wanting me to censure the governor,'' Greer said. \"The tea party came into existence. There was a feeling within the party that the tea party was just a bunch of whack-a-dos.\" \n \n \u2022 After the party's budget and audit committee started asking questions about House and Senate spending, including legislators who used party credit cards for personal expenses, Greer said he wanted to open the books and credit card records, but party officials and legislative leaders vetoed the idea. \n \n \u2022 Greer said he warned others at the party that the budget committee was made up of \"whack-a-do, right-wing crazies'' who were trying to take over because of continuing disagreements with Crist and legislative leaders. House and Senate leaders insisted that no one at the party could control their campaign finances. \"We eat what we kill,'' Greer said the leaders told him. \"Legislative leaders were using their party credit cards like drunken sailors and they made it clear to me I was not to interfere with their spending,'' Greer said. \n \n Thrasher, who succeeded Greer as party chairman, called Greer's suggestion of voter suppression and other accusations \"absurd, absolutely absurd'' and said Greer is making \"baseless accusations on other people in an effort to divert attention from himself.'' \n \n Thrasher said party officials had no choice but to get rid of Greer once they discovered he had secretly created a company that was getting money from the party. \n \n Many of the questions posed to Greer were about his creation of Victory Strategies LLC, a company that collected almost $200,000 from the party while he was running it. The criminal charges stem from that contract. \n \n Greer's animosity was evident on almost every page of the deposition as he described the inner workings of a party that has controlled Florida since 1998. \n \n On voter suppression, Greer said he had just completed a December 2009 meeting with party general counsel Jason Gonzalez, political consultant Jim Rimes and Eric Eikenberg, Crist's chief of staff, when questions arose about fundraising. \n \n \"I was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting. It had been one of those days,'' he said. \n \n Rimes said he recalls no discussion of suppressing votes at any meeting. Eikenberg did not return phone calls. \n \n Greer said party officials were questioning spending on fundraising trips to New York, Yankees games, limos, expensive cigars and other items when Gonzalez asked him if he had any ownership in Victory Strategies. Greer said he initially denied owning any interest in the company but later admitted it when he and Gonzalez were alone. Gonzalez told state investigators that Greer did not own up to his involvement in the business and threatened to sue anyone who made the accusation. A number of other party officials told state investigators they were unaware of Greer's involvement in the company. Contacted this week, Gonzalez said he could not publicly discuss the case. \n \n Asked about his failure to tell other officials, Greer said they didn't ask. \n \n Asked if he told party finance chairman John Rood, a Jacksonville businessman, Greer said Rood was \"basically useless as finance chairman.'' \n \n By late December 2009, Greer found himself under pressure to resign. He said he agreed to leave for the \"betterment of the party'' and in January 2010 signed a severance agreement that was to pay him the rest of his $130,000 for the year. \n \n Greer said he got concerned when Haridopolos and Thrasher, who had both signed the agreement, began to publicly deny knowledge of it. Haridopolos later admitted signing it, insisting he had not read it. \n \n \"Around the party most people considered President Haridopolos to be not the brightest person, but I would assume he would have read the agreement before he signed it,'' Greer said. \n \n Greer had good words only for House Speaker Dean Cannon, saying the Orlando Republican tried to get others to live up to the severance agreement and promised to help him find a lobbying job and clients. \n \n After others at the party refused to honor the severance agreement, Greer said Cannon and Haridopolos contacted his friend Jim Stelling to say that political consultants Pat Bainter and Marc Reicheldfer were going to pay Greer $200,000. \n \n Despite promises of payment and a request from Bainter for information on where to wire the money, none was ever paid, Greer said. After he left the party, Greer said he heard that Thrasher was telling people they were going to have him arrested. A short time later, Greer was indicted by a statewide grand jury on charges of money laundering and fraud. \n \n The charges and the party's failure to pay him have ruined his life, Greer said. \n \n \"They took everything I worked for my whole life,'' he added. Now his family is on food stamps, some of his possessions have been repossessed and his children watched their father being arrested. \n \n \"Any good thing I did at the Republican Party has been destroyed by these people,'' he said. \"I want my life back. I want them to say they are sorry for what they did to me.'' ||||| In the debate over new laws meant to curb voter fraud in places like Florida, Democrats always charge that Republicans are trying to suppress the vote of liberal voting blocs like blacks and young people, while Republicans just laugh at such ludicrous and offensive accusations. That is, every Republican except for Florida\u2019s former Republican Party chairman Jim Greer, who, scorned by his party and in deep legal trouble, blew the lid off what he claims was a systemic effort to suppress the black vote.

And while Trump has called Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to Congress that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school, \"credible\" and \"compelling,\" he has continued to support Kavanaugh's confirmation and emphatically defend his character. \n \n Trump's comments on Tuesday were just the latest instance of the President expressing concern about the public outcry resulting from the allegations against Kavanaugh and the impact on other men. \n \n \"It's a very scary situation where you're guilty until proven innocent. My whole life I've heard you're innocent until proven guilty, but now you're guilty until proven innocent.

Some standout lines, per Time, the AP, and the Hill: \"You can be an exemplary person for 35 years and then somebody comes and they say 'you did this or that,' and they give three witnesses, and the three witnesses at this point do not corroborate what she was saying.

You could be somebody that was perfect your entire life, and somebody could accuse you of something. Doesn't necessarily have to be a woman ... but somebody could accuse you of something and you're automatically guilty, but in this realm you are truly guilty until proven innocent. That's one of the very, very bad things that's taking place right now.\" As for what kind of a time it is for women, \"Women are doing great,\" he replied when asked if he had a message for them. CNN sees parallels between Trump's statements and comments Donald Trump Jr. made in a Monday interview with the Daily Mail in which he said that, in light of the Kavanaugh allegations, he is more afraid for his sons. \"I mean, right now, I'd say my sons. I've got boys, and I've got girls. And when I see what's going on right now, it's scary.\"",

He's now facing charges of felony Official Misconduct and misdemeanor Theft. \n \n Many days,the LaPorte Post Office is busy with mail coming in and out all day long. \n \n According to court records, for about six months in late 2016 to early 2017, a lot of mail never made it to its destination. \n \n Inclduing destinations like, longtime LaPorte resident, Wally Bass's home. \n \n \u201cAt least two to three times a week, we wouldn't get no mail and I knew that we had mail that was supposed to come, bills and different stuff,\u201d said Bass. \n \n Court records show in February of 2017, tubs containing frozen mail were found in a ravine in New Buffalo. \n \n Those pieces were tracked back to the LaPorte Post Office and, at the time, mail carrier Kristopher Block's assigned routes. \n \n The documents say Block admitted to a detective with the post office that he paid a friend $50 to burn mail he didn't have time to deliver on a \u201cregular basis.\u201d \n \n Bass says he's had things like worker's comp checks go missing. \n \n \u201cIt's a crap-shoot whether you are going to get your mail or not,\" he said. \"Finally, we just got tired of it and we got a P.O. box.\" \n \n Records show, postal service special agents found 11,000 pieces of mail in tubs in New Buffalo and when those agents went to Block's home, they found about 6,000 more. \n \n WSBT 22 also went to Block's home, but no one answered the door. \n \n Bass says he's happy the mail was found. He hopes something like this doesn't happen again. \n \n \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to have my mail delivered back to my house everyday where I don't have to pay for a P.O. box,\u201d said Bass. \n \n WSBT 22 spoke to an official from the U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General who provided the following statement: \n \n \u201cThe vast majority of U.S. Postal Service personnel are dedicated, hard-working public servants dedicated to moving mail to its proper destination who would never consider engaging in any form of criminal behavior.

Sean Gallup / Getty Images, file \n \n The German vacationer had been waiting four years for the payout after her Thomas Cook Airlines flight from Vienna, Austria, to the Caribbean took off 22 hours late. \n \n European Union regulations entitle passengers on late or canceled flights to compensation according to a fixed tariff based on distance and the length of the delay. \n \n However, the woman, who has not been publicly identified, never received her cash. She eventually approached a claims company who contracted a lawyer to take the matter to court in Austria. \n \n A court order for payment was secured, and an official informed Salzburg Airport Friday that he was empowered to ground a Thomas Cook Airlines jet \u2014 worth tens of millions of dollars \u2014 until the outstanding amount was paid. \n \n \"Some airlines use the tactic of blocking requests or taking so long that people give up\" \n \n Thomas Cook's sister airline, Condor, immediately paid the money so that the aircraft did not need to be impounded and no enforcement action was needed. \n \n \"We first heard of the claim on Friday, when we were notified by the airport in Salzburg,\" Condor spokesman Johannes Winter told NBC News. \"Once we heard of it, we immediately paid. We are very sorry that it took this long.\" \n \n The woman was represented by compensation company FlightRight, which handles the paperwork in exchange for a 25 percent fee in the case of successful payouts. \n \n \"Some airlines use the tactic of blocking requests or taking so long that people give up,\" the firm's legal chief, Jonas Swarzenski, told NBC News. \"I think this was just an administrative mistake by the airline, the claim probably just got lost on somebody's desk.\" \n \n He said only 15 percent of travelers who are entitled to EU compensation ever make a claim. \n \n The regulations also cover transatlantic flights from the U.S. to Europe operated by EU-based airlines, and return flights from Europe to the U.S. operated by any airline. ||||| Any frequent traveler knows the particular pain of a (very) delayed flight, and the only thing that could make it worse is an airline that takes forever to refund a fee or send out a voucher. However, a woman whose lawsuit against Thomas Cook Airlines resulted in a victory in Austrian court could be an empowering moment for us all. The unnamed woman, a German citizen, was booked on a Thomas Cook flight from Vienna to the Caribbean that got delayed a whopping 22 hours because of mechanical issues. Although she was promised $680 as per European Union regulations that compensate passengers based on the length of their delay, the woman got frustrated dealing with Thomas Cook's sluggishness getting her the cash. \n \n The woman, however, was undeterred. She hired FlightRight , a claims company that fights airlines to get fees paid out (in exchange for a portion of the money), which won the suit in Austrian small claims court. A judge ruled in favor of the woman, then informed personnel at Salzburg Airport that they had the right to impound a Thomas Cook plane until the outstanding debt was cleared. Considering planes are worth tens of millions of dollars, that ruling got the airline's attention in a big way, and a rep from Condor, Thomas Cook's partner airline, promptly paid up. \"We first heard of the claim on Friday, when we were notified by the airport in Salzburg,\" a Condor spokesperson told NBC News . \"Once we heard of it, we immediately paid. We are very sorry that it took this long.\" A rep for FlightRight said that many airlines try to stall on paying out claims, hoping people will get fed up and not follow through. Only about 15 percent of EU residents who qualify for airline reimbursements even file for them in the first place, and we're guessing that most of them aren't as persistent as this woman. \n \n Does this mean American domestic airlines could soon run afoul of the same public embarrassment? It's less likely, since the U.S. doesn't have the same protections for passengers as the EU. But we still love the visual of a woman towing a jumbo jet home with her behind her car or spray-painting \"Property of Disgruntled Customer\" on the side. ||||| Staff writers news.com.au \n \n A PASSENGER whose flight was delayed has exacted the ultimate revenge against an airline by securing a court order to impound one of its multi-million dollar jets. \n \n The unidentified woman from Germany had been locked in a four-year battle with Thomas Cook Airlines over a compensation payout of $US680 ($AU900) over a flight from Austria to the Caribbean that took off 22 hours late due to mechanical issues. \n \n The woman was entitled to compensation under European Union regulations, which allows qualified passengers on late or cancelled flights to claim reimbursement depending on the distance and time of delay. \n \n But Thomas Cook Airlines never came through with the payment, and the woman took the matter to an Austrian court. \n \n A court order was issued over the payment, and an official told Salzburg Airport last week he was empowered to ground a Thomas Cook Airlines jet, worth tens of millions of dollars, until the airline came through with the money, NBC News reports. \n \n Thomas Cook\u2019s sister airline, Condor, paid the money straight away and the aircraft avoided getting impounded. \n \n \u201cWe first heard of the claim on Friday, when we were notified by the airport in Salzburg,\u201d Condor spokesman Johannes Winter told NBC News. \n \n \u201cOnce we heard of it, we immediately paid.

A German woman's flight from Austria to the Caribbean was delayed 22 hours for mechanical issues, earning her a $680 payout. But four years later, Thomas Cook Airlines still hadn't paid up. So the woman went to a claims company called FlightRight and took the airline to court. On Friday, an official armed with a court order warned Salzburg Airport that Thomas Cook was about to have one of its jets impounded, affecting flights, unless it ponied up the woman's money.

According to the Washington Post, the woman was entitled to compensation under European Union regulations based on the distance and the length of the delay. But she didn't receive her $680 until she approached a claims company and took the matter to court in Austria. On Friday, an official at Salzburg Airport informed Thomas Cook that he had the authority to ground its jet\u2014worth tens of millions of dollars\u2014until the money was paid. \"We first heard of the claim on Friday, when we were notified by the airport in Salzburg,\" says a spokesperson for Thomas Cook's sister airline, Condor. \"Once we heard of it, we immediately paid. We are very sorry that it took this long.\" The woman was represented by compensation company FlightRight, which handles the paperwork in exchange for a 25% fee in the case of successful payouts. \"Some airlines use the tactic of blocking requests or taking so long that people give up,\" the firm's legal chief says. \"I think this was just an administrative mistake by the airline, the claim probably just got lost on somebody's desk.\" \u2013 When a German woman sued Thomas Cook Airlines after her flight from Vienna to the Caribbean was delayed 22 hours, it took her almost two years to get the $680 she was promised, Consumerist reports. But thanks to a small-claims court ruling in Austria last week, the airline was forced to pay up\u2014right away. \"We first heard of the claim on Friday, when we were notified by the airport in Salzburg,\" a rep for Thomas Cook's partner airline, Condor, tells NBC News. \"Once we heard of it, we immediately paid. We are very sorry that it took this long.\" The woman's lawyer, Jonas Swarzenski, tells Consumerist that the airline probably just \"got lost on somebody's desk\" and was trying to keep the woman from filing a claim in the first place. Under European Union regulations, airlines are required to compensate passengers whose flights are delayed more than 24 hours. The woman, who is not being named, filed a claim with FlightRight, a claims company that works with airlines to get fees paid out. She won the suit in Austrian small claims court, and when the judge ruled in her favor, Salzburg Airport had the right to impound a Thomas Cook plane until the outstanding debt was cleared. \u2013 For four years, a German woman has been fighting Thomas Cook Airlines over a compensation payout for a flight that took 22 hours to get from Austria to the Caribbean\u2014and she just won. A court order has allowed her to have one of the airline's multimillion-dollar jets impounded, News.com.au reports. The woman was entitled to the payout under European Union regulations, which allow passengers to claim compensation when their flight is delayed more than three hours. But the airline never came through with the payment, and the woman took the matter to court. An official at Salzburg Airport told reporters last week that he had the authority to ground a Thomas Cook jet, worth tens of millions, until the airline paid up. \"We first heard of the claim on Friday, when we were notified by the airport in Salzburg,\" a spokesman for Thomas Cook's sister airline, Condor, tells NBC News. \"Once we heard of it, we immediately paid. We are very sorry that it took this long.\" The legal chief of compensation company FlightRight, which represented the woman, says he believes it was an innocent mistake by the airline. \"Some airlines use the tactic of blocking requests or taking so long that people give up,\" he says. \"I think this was just",

In this case, the 47-year-old woman said that aside from mood issues she was healthy when she upped her fluids and use of herbal remedies, including milk thistle, molkosan, l-theanine, glutamine, vitamin B compound, vervain, sage tea, green tea, and valerian root. Doctors in September reported in the British Medical Journal Case Reports that she suffered from acute severe \"hyponatremia,\" which occurs when there is abnormally low sodium in one's blood. She had gone to the ER after suffering a seizure. Most cases of hyponatremia occur after someone consumes a ton of water\u2014more than 2.5 gallons in a day\u2014but this woman's fluid intake wasn't that high. Then, a possible clue: Doctors found a similar case of a man with the same condition who also hadn't hit that intake level but had ingested valerian root. The doctors note that two case studies are insufficient evidence, but suggest it's possible the root \"altered this threshold [of fluid intake], allowing severe hyponatremia to develop at an earlier stage.\" The British Dietetic Association tells the BBC that the whole notion of detoxing is without merit, as many of our organs (even our skin) regularly detoxify the body. It may sound less sexy, but they add that for most people \"a sensible diet and regular physical activity\" is best. (Experts are also rolling their eyes at the souping trend.)",

    "document": "Share On more Share On more \n \n Mitt Romney, trailing in the polls, needed to prove tonight that he could stand on stage with President Barack Obama as an equal and a plausible president of the United States. \n \n He did that in the crucial first 40 minutes of Wednesday night's debate, addressing Obama respectfully, even warmly \u2014 but then tangling with a sometimes hazy and professorial Obama on taxes and deficits. \n \n \"You don't just pick the winners and losers \u2014 you pick the losers,\" he told Obama of his energy investments, sliding time and time again into a second person singular address calculated to level the rhetorical playing field. \n \n Romney departed dramatically from the hard conservatism of his primary campaign, downplaying the scope of his tax cuts. \n \n \u201cThere will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit,\" he said, without fully explaining how he'd accomplish that. \n \n And he sought to soften the edge of his cuts with an easy example of the cuts he'd make. \n \n \"I'm sorry Jim, but I'm going to stop this subsidy to PBS. I like Big Bird, I like you, too,\" he said. \n \n And he embraced \u2014 to a point \u2014 the Simpson-Bowles plan for cutting the deficit, while stopping short of actually crossing the line to support a tax increase. \n \n But Romney's core success was that he won by not losing: He has barely weathered a campaign that reduced him to a smaller figure than President Obama. On stage, they were roughly the same size. ||||| Obama often sounded like he was defending a doctoral dissertation, Simon writes. | REUTERS Obama snoozes and loses \n \n DENVER \u2014 One word of advice for Barack Obama before his next debate: caffeine. \n \n I had a Pepsi right before the debate started Wednesday night and was tingly for the next 90 minutes. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n President Obama looked like someone had slipped him an Ambien. \n \n ( Also on POLITICO: 5 takeaways from the Denver debate) \n \n The first presidential debate of 2012 took place at the University of Denver and was between Obama and Mitt Romney. But only Romney showed up. \n \n For much of the debate, it appeared as if Obama, the former professor, and not Obama, the presidential candidate, was on stage. \n \n It\u2019s not that Romney\u2019s performance was perfect or polished \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s just that Obama\u2019s was so mediocre. \n \n It is possible Obama was overconfident, but I doubt it. He is not a foolish man. So I think he was just overtired or over-distracted or over-something. But he sure wasn\u2019t over-energetic. \n \n ( PHOTOS: Obama not having fun) \n \n Maybe Jen Psaki, his traveling press secretary, was preparing us when she said on Air Force One Sunday that Obama \u201chas had less time to prepare than we anticipated. That\u2019s just a fact. It\u2019s difficult to schedule significant blocks of time when you\u2019re the president.\u201d \n \n Mitt Romney, by comparison, seemed bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. He seemed to enjoy being there. \n \n He was far from profound. \u201cMy priority is putting people back to work in this country,\u201d he said. \n \n And: \u201cI love great schools.\u201d \n \n Trite? You bet. But at least he spoke in reasonably short sentences. \n \n Obama often sounded like he was defending a doctoral dissertation. His thoughts seemed to range from lengthy to endless. \n \n Mr. President, shorter is better. Really. We are a society with a short attention span. \n \n ( Also on POLITICO: Not debatable: Obama stumbled) \n \n Complex problems do not require complex answers. Not on TV, they don\u2019t. Once a candidate is safely elected, he can be as long-winded as he wants in the White House and even before Congress. \n \n But he has to get elected. And it\u2019s a little early for Obama to fall on the ball. Which is where he seemed to spend most of the evening Wednesday. \n \n And, by so doing, he let Romney get away with a lot. \n \n \u201cMr. President, you\u2019re entitled to your own airplane and your own house, but not to your own facts,\u201d Romney said in one of the few zingers of the debate. \n \n Couldn\u2019t Obama have replied in kind? Obama could have said something like: \u201cAnd you, Gov. Romney, think you\u2019re entitled to car elevators and Swiss bank accounts!\u201d ||||| You can think of a general election campaign as being divided into four quarters. \n \n The first one consists of the presidential primaries. What matters in this stage is not only who gets nominated, but how well they position themselves for the remainder of the race, through things like fund-raising, adopting (or avoiding) issue positions that might be damaging later, gaining experience on the campaign trail, building out their staffs and receiving at least an initial round of vetting by the news media. \n \n The second quarter begins when the candidates effectively clinch their nominations, and the general election campaign begins in earnest. This period is long and sluggish, and most of the \u201cfans\u201d (voters) will not really have tuned in yet. But it is also a time when a campaign makes important strategic decisions, in terms of its tone and tenor, its allocation of resources, and its issue positioning \u2014 decisions that it may be stuck with, for better or for worse. The second quarter culminates when the candidates make their vice-presidential selections. \n \n The third quarter consists of the party conventions and their immediate aftermath. It is a short quarter as far as the calendar goes, but one in which the winner of the election often becomes much more apparent. George H.W. Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992, and George W. Bush in 2004 moved into leads after the conventions that they essentially never relinquished. \n \n We\u2019ve probably already been in the fourth quarter for a week or so, because we\u2019ve already passed the point when a convention bounce (if it was indeed a bounce and not a permanent shift in the conditions) might be expected to wear off. And we\u2019ll reach a fourth-quarter landmark on Wednesday, when President Obama and Mitt Romney hold their first of three debates. \n \n \n \n Every now and then, the game goes into overtime \u2014 in which case things like turnout and the Electoral College math suddenly begin to matter a great deal. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves: it\u2019s early in the fourth quarter and Mitt Romney finds himself down in the race. The question is how far behind he is, and what he\u2019ll have to do to make up his deficit with Mr. Obama. \n \n According to the win probability calculator at AdvancedNFLStats.com, an N.F.L. team down by field goal with 10 minutes left to play in the fourth quarter has a 34 percent probability of winning the game. A team down by a touchdown wins just 16 percent of the time. \n \n (A technical note for sports geeks: these cases assume that the trailing team has possession of the football with first down and 10 yards to go at its own 20 yard line.) \n \n If you look at our estimate of Mitt Romney\u2019s chances of winning the Electoral College, which are about 15 percent right now in the FiveThirtyEight forecast, the touchdown analogy works best: Mr. Romney has about as much chance of winning as an N.F.L. team does when it trails by a touchdown early in the fourth quarter. \n \n It might be surprising that a team down by just a touchdown \u2014 a close game, by any common description of it \u2014 winds up winning so rarely. But there are a few things to consider. \n \n First, a field goal alone won\u2019t be enough for the team to come back. It needs something big to happen \u2014 or it needs to score at least twice. \n \n Second, although there\u2019s still enough time in the game for the trailing team to have multiple opportunities to score, there is also enough time for the opponents to score as well and extend their lead. So the team still has to play defense \u2014 it\u2019s not purely a two-minute drill. \n \n A third and often overlooked (if completely obvious) point: if the trailing team does score a clutch touchdown, it only ties the game. There are a lot of cases in which it will later lose anyway. \n \n Right now, our forecast says that Mr. Romney has only about a 15 percent chance of winning. But that does not mean that he only has a 15 percent chance of tightening the race \u2014 or of making it come down to the wire. \n \n But there are plenty of circumstances in which Mr. Romney has some good things happen, makes the race very close, and then loses \u2014 whether because he loses Ohio, or because his turnout operation isn\u2019t much good, or because the polls turn out to be slightly biased toward him rather than against him. \n \n As for what might happen this week: the first debate alone will probably not provide an opportunity for Mr. Romney to score a touchdown. Historically, the largest shifts in the polls after the first debate have been about three points in either direction \u2014 smaller than Mr. Romney\u2019s current deficit in most polls. This would be the equivalent of a field goal. \n \n But there is also another potential scoring opportunity for Mr. Romney: the monthly jobs report, the next-to-last one before the election, will come out on Friday. \n \n My view is that we\u2019ve gotten to the point where the importance of these jobs reports can be a little overstated. That\u2019s not because the economy isn\u2019t important (of course it is), or because jobs aren\u2019t an important economic indicator (of course they are), but because any one economic report won\u2019t tell you all that much. Furthermore, both the forecasts of jobs numbers and the government\u2019s initial estimates of it are quite crude. Payrolls are expected to have grown by about 115,000 jobs in this month\u2019s report, but those forecasts miss, on average, by about 70,000 jobs. \n \n Still, there is about a one-in-five chance (based on the historical distribution of forecast errors) that the jobs estimate will miss by at least that margin to the downside, which means that fewer than 50,000 jobs will have been created last month. If we print a jobs number somewhere in that range \u2014 say, just 35,000 jobs added last month \u2014 perhaps that counts as another field goal for Mr. Romney. \n \n Here\u2019s where the precision of our analogy breaks down. Unlike in a football game, we do not know exactly how far Mr. Romney is behind. Could a clear win for Mr. Romney in the debate \u2014 and a distinctively bad (but not subzero) jobs report \u2014 be enough to draw the race into a tie? One of those things alone probably won\u2019t do it. But if he gets both? It seems possible, at least, but it\u2019s hard to know for sure. \n \n Also unlike in a football game, of course, the candidates don\u2019t necessarily take turns. We\u2019ve just described Mr. Romney\u2019s dream scenario, an imaginable (if not exceptionally likely) sequence of events that could have the race looking almost even by a week or two from now. But it could be Mr. Obama who scores next instead. If he is perceived as winning the debate, and the jobs number misses by a substantial margin to the upside (meaning that more than about 180,000 jobs are created), Mr. Romney\u2019s position could become extremely desperate. \n \n Sunday\u2019s Polls \n \n There were some interesting polls on Sunday, but not necessarily ones that ought to much alter our understanding of the race. \n \n The most noteworthy number was a national poll from The Washington Post and ABC News. Their top-line number was good for Mr. Romney, putting him just two points behind among likely voters \u2014 closer than most other recent surveys. \n \n In context, however, the poll was not quite as encouraging as it seemed for Mr. Romney. One issue is that the trendline did not improve for him. The Washington Post and ABC News national polls have generally shown fairly strong numbers for Mr. Romney; they had him behind by just one point among likely voters in a poll they conducted just after the Democratic convention, and ahead by two points in their poll before either party convention. \n \n Another issue is that the story that the Washington Post and ABC News polls are telling about the election is one in which Mr. Romney has Electoral College problems. Although their national polls have shown a very tight race throughout the year, their recent surveys of Florida, Ohio and Virginia had Mr. Obama with big leads there. For that matter, a breakout from their latest national poll showed Mr. Obama with a much clearer lead in swing states than in the country as a whole. I don\u2019t think you should make very much of that \u2014 I\u2019d much rather look at actual polls of the swing states than a small-sample breakout that lumps them all together \u2014 but since the Washington Post and ABC News polls have shown quite poor numbers for Mr. Romney in the battleground states that they surveyed, at least we\u2019re getting a consistent story from them. \n \n There were also two Ohio polls on Wednesday. One, from Public Policy Polling, put Mr. Romney down by four points there. If The Washington Post\u2019s national poll was not quite as strong as it looked for Mr. Romney, this one was a little better for him than it might appear, since Public Policy Polling\u2019s surveys are slightly Democratic-leaning and since their other two polls of Ohio since the conventions had shown Mr. Obama with slightly larger leads. \n \n However, this was counterbalanced by a Columbus Dispatch poll, which put Mr. Obama ahead by nine points in Ohio. The Columbus Dispatch poll is highly unusual \u2014 it is conducted entirely by mail \u2014 a technique that has produced some big hits and big misses in the past. But the trendline is worth looking at even if the topline numbers should be taken with some caution, and it was very favorable for Mr. Obama since their August poll had shown a tied race. \n \n My impressionistic view is that Mr. Obama\u2019s polls have not been quite as strong over the past three or four days as they were early last week, but the FiveThirtyEight forecast does not yet record any signs of a turnaround. Mr. Obama\u2019s position held steady in the \u201cnow-cast,\u201d our estimate of what would happen in an election held today. And he gained slightly in the Nov. 6 forecast, as he is likely to do on most days in which the polling is neutral or ambiguous, since time is running off Mr. Romney\u2019s clock. \n \n But time in a presidential campaign is not linear. By this point next week, two of Mr. Romney\u2019s best remaining opportunities to change the game will have come and gone. ||||| You only needed to look at the faces of MSNBC\u2019s pundits or Democratic officials in the spin room to know what everyone professionally involved in politics believes \u2014 Mitt Romney won big in this first debate. We\u2019ll see how the public digests it, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the polls draw close in the next week and that thereafter this race \u2014 as was always likely \u2014 goes down to the wire. \n \n I\u2019ll let others assess in detail Romney\u2019s assertive presence and demeanor, and the obvious toll it took on the president, who, in split screen shots when he wasn\u2019t speaking, often looked irked or working a bit to suppress frustration or anger. \n \n What interests me most is Mitt\u2019s audacity. Wednesday night at long last came the full-throated return of the Rockefeller Republican many suspect is Romney\u2019s true political nature, if indeed he has one. With one fatal exception I\u2019ll note in a moment, on taxes, health care, education, regulation and more, Romney came across as deeply informed, experienced and reasonable, and as a powerful and articulate critic of the economy\u2019s weaknesses on Obama\u2019s watch. \n \n Romney\u2019s macro theory of the race has always been that in a time of high unemployment and economic anxiety, being a credible alternative would suffice. Until tonight, the polls suggested that strategy was falling short. Now, it looks much more plausible, especially when combined with the iron political law that every presidential campaign eventually obeys: Do what you have to do to get the nomination, and then appeal to the center once its locked up. I expected Mitt to turn to the middle right after he became the de facto nominee, or at least at the convention, and not wait until now. If he wins, of course, Romney and his advisers will be hailed as geniuses for their timing, for bonding the party faithful to the ticket with the choice of Paul Ryan and a conservative-themed convention, and then dashing to the center for the home stretch. \n \n Look at what we saw Wednesday night. Mitt Romney believes that of course we need regulation to make markets work, and that banks need higher capital standards to protect taxpayers from having to bail out their bad bets \u2014 yet he also laid out some convincing ideas about Dodd-Frank\u2019s unintended consequences and shortcomings. He\u2019d mend banking regulation, not end it. His air of reasonableness made Obama\u2019s retort that Romney wanted to let Wall Street run wild feel off key. This tone and positioning was emblematic of Romney\u2019s performance across a number of issues. \n \n Health care has always required enormous audacity from Romney. While his attempt to distinguish his Massachusetts plan from Obamacare wasn\u2019t persuasive to someone like me, who has studied the details for years, I think it would have appeared perfectly reasonable to less wonky voters. I won\u2019t rehearse them all here, but Romney previewed his staccato talking points on this matter in the Republican primary debates, and I wrote then that (to my astonishment) he was on his way to a politically sufficient position. That Romney can not only pull this off but also go on offense while doing it (when in fact Romneycare is basically the same as Obamacare) takes remarkable dexterity. \n \n Which brings us to Mitt\u2019s audacity on taxes: What can Obama reply when Romney says, as he now does, that he\u2019ll insist that his reforms end up both revenue and distributionally neutral, so that we\u2019re simply getting the supposed growth benefit from lower marginal rates, especially for small business? The president can call him a flip flopper or mathematically challenged, or assert that it can\u2019t work without taking on sacred cows like the mortgage interest deduction and the tax exemption for employer-provided health benefits, but so long as Romney has Marty Feldstein and other respected economists saying it\u2019s theoretically possible, as a political matter, it\u2019s likely a draw. (The truth is that Romney originally proposed cutting taxes only for middle income earners who would \u201csuffered most in the Obama economy,\u201d before he decided in the primaries to sign on to bolder conservative tax theology to win, so this may in fact be a return to an emphasis Romney actually \u201cbelieves in\u201d \u2013 to the extent that this is an intelligible concept.) \n \n Romney\u2019s critics \u2014 including me \u2014 are often frustrated that he\u2019s been laughably inconsistent on policy over time. But, as I\u2019ve argued before, from his point of view this criticism really doesn\u2019t matter. Romney\u2019s not trying to win a prize from pundits for coherence or consistency. He\u2019s trying to win the power of the presidency. Actual consistency \u2014 as opposed to the appearance of having certain guiding principles \u2014 has surprisingly little relevance when it comes to getting to 50 percent plus one. Just ask Ronald Reagan, who pragmatically raised taxes multiple times as both governor and president while winning elections and retaining his reputation as an anti-tax crusader. \n \n Yet taxes were the most striking of the president\u2019s many failures Wednesday to draw contrasts that would have rightly made Romney look unattractive. Amazingly, Obama failed to dramatize the injustice of Romney\u2019s desire to exempt wealthy individuals like himself from any participation in the inevitable fiscal adjustment the country faces. He made the point feebly that Romney wouldn\u2019t go for even a 10 to 1 spending cut to tax hike deal, and tossed out a weird line about Donald Trump, but he didn\u2019t hammer home the insanity and immorality of constantly cutting taxes on high earners when we\u2019ve been at war for a decade and now need to pay for the boomers\u2019 costly retirement. \n \n Indeed, if I were advising Romney, I\u2019d say that atop tonight\u2019s performance, if Romney said he\u2019d be open to top earners bearing a greater tax burden as part of broader changes that get our long term fiscal house in order, he\u2019d knock out the single most indefensible policy choice that lets Democrats brand him justly as nefarious. He must have reasons for not doing this, but with Romney, who knows what\u2019s coming? Maybe in the next debate he\u2019ll say he\u2019s thought it over and that people like him may need to pay something more, and he\u2019ll score big with independent voters. \n \n Obama\u2019s other striking omission was his failure to slam the Republican Congress for its failure to cooperate on what was essentially a Republican-style health reform. Again, the president hit the point once, but feebly. He left Romney looking like a leader who could pass a major health reform on a bipartisan basis, and Obama as lacking the chops to do the same in Washington. That\u2019s unfair to Obama \u2014 as in the first years of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Republicans were determined in 2009 and 2010 to do everything in their power to foil major health reform or to gain politically if it passed. But Obama failed completely to articulate this reality for the viewing audience. \n \n It\u2019s hard to know what the president or his team were thinking Wednesday night. Maybe those who said it is a rattling experience for any president used to sycophants to be confronted in public by a forceful critic were right: This throws a man off his game. Maybe the campaign figured its ads could do the dirty work while Obama took the high road while on stage. But whatever Team Obama thought before Wednesday night, it\u2019s about to change. Because based on the first debate, it\u2019s a recipe for defeat. \n \n Matt Miller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fund and a contributor to MSNBC.

But a second poll they conducted after the debate found 47.8 percent of respondents giving Mr. Romney the advantage, against 25.4 percent for Mr. Obama. \n \n There is not a lot of empirical research on the relationship between instant reaction polls and their eventual effect on the head-to-head polls. However, these were strong numbers for Mr. Romney where comparisons to past post-debate polls are available. A similar CBS News poll conducted among undecided voters after the first debate in 2008, for example, found that 40 percent said that Mr. Obama won the debate, against 22 percent for John McCain. The head-to-head polls moved toward Mr. Obama by about three percentage points after that debate, although some of that may have been from the momentum that Mr. Obama had carrying into the evening. \n \n The 67 percent of voters in the CNN poll who said that Mr. Romney won Wednesday night\u2019s debate was higher than in any of the network\u2019s surveys of the 2008 debates. \n \n By comparison, 51 percent of debate-watchers in a CNN poll after the first presidential debate in 2008 said that Mr. Obama had the stronger performance. And 58 percent said so after the third and final presidential debate in 2008. \n \n There may be some mitigating factors for Mr. Obama. First, although the conventional wisdom was that Mr. Obama had a lackluster performance throughout most of the debate \u2014 he certainly had an extremely cautious and defensive strategy \u2014 there were few obvious moments in which he said things that will make for compelling YouTube clips or cable news soundbites. \n \n Second, head-to-head polls throughout the election cycle have been hard to influence for any reason. There are few undecided voters remaining \u2014 and undecided voters may be less likely than others to have actually watched the debates. \n \n Still, it seems likely that Mr. Romney will make at least some gains in head-to-head polls after the debate, and entirely plausible that they will be toward the high end of the historical range, in which polls moved by about three percentage points toward the candidate who was thought to have the stronger debate. \n \n The FiveThirtyEight \u201cnow-cast\u201d \u2014 our estimate of what would happen in an election held immediately \u2014 had Mr. Romney trailing by a wider margin than three points in advance of the debate. (Instead, it put his deficit at about five points nationwide.) But our Nov. 6 forecast anticipated that the race would tighten some. It\u2019s going to take a few days for any reaction to the debate to filter through the FiveThirtyEight model. \n \n My own instant reaction is that Mr. Romney may have done the equivalent of kicking a field goal, perhaps not bringing the race to a draw, but setting himself up in such a way that his comeback chances have improved by a material amount. The news cycle will be busy between now and Nov. 6, with a jobs report coming out on Friday, a vice-presidential debate next week and then two more presidential debates on Oct. 16 and Oct. 22. \n \n According to one prominent offshore gambling site, Pinnacle Sports, Mr. Obama\u2019s odds of winning the election declined to about 73 percent after the debate from around 80 percent beforehand.",

John McCain, sent a letter Sunday to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell requesting a special committee to probe reported Russian interference into the November presidential election. \n \n \u201cCybersecurity is the ultimate cross-jurisdictional challenge,\u201d the letter states.

Peter King (R-Seaford) called for an investigation into whether and why CIA director John Brennan leaked information on Russian hacking to members of the media.

Were they in touch with the Russians?\" John Podesta asked. | AP Photo Podesta suggests Trump associates may have colluded with Russian hackers \n \n Former Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said Sunday he believes that Donald Trump's associates may have colluded with Russian hackers to win the election. \n \n In his first TV interview since Hillary Clinton's loss, Podesta said he doesn't believe that the president-elect himself was part of the plan but suggested some of his associates may have gone off the reservation. The Electoral College electors, he said, have the right to know the extent of the Trump campaign's involvement before they cast their votes Monday. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \"It's very much unknown whether there was collusion,\" Podesta said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n \n \"What did Trump Inc. know?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Liz Johnstone \n \n John Podesta, former chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign, said Sunday that the FBI first contacted him about his hacked emails two days after WikiLeaks began publishing them \u2014 and that he has not heard from the FBI since. \n \n \"Let's go through the chronology. On October 7, the Access Hollywood tapes comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails into the public,\" Podesta told Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press,\" referencing the leaked tape from 2005 that features now-President-elect Donald Trump bragging in graphic terms about kissing and groping women without their consent. \"One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence. Two days later, the FBI contacted me, and the first thing the agent said to me was, 'I don't know if you're aware but your email account might have been hacked.' I said, yes, I was aware of that.\" \n \n Todd pressed Podesta on when he knew that his emails had been stolen. \n \n \"In one of those DNC documents that appeared to me ... that might have came from my account,\" Podesta said. \"So I wasn't sure. I didn't know what they had, what they didn't have. It wasn't until October 7 when [WikiLeaks' Julian] Assange ... started dumping them out and said they would all dump out, that's when I knew that they had the contents of my email account.\" \n \n \"By the way,\" Podesta added, \"that was the last time I'd heard from the FBI.\" \n \n \"Do you expect to get a phone call before the end of the year?\" Todd asked. \n \n \"Maybe before the end of the show,\" Podesta joked. \n \n Intelligence officials confirmed Friday that the FBI agrees with the CIA's assessment that Russia mounted a covert operation intended not just to disrupt the 2016 election, but to help Trump win. U.S. intelligence now has \"a high level of confidence\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the campaign. \n \n Podesta recently published an op-ed in the Washington Post arguing that \"something is deeply broken\" within the FBI and called for a full, independent investigation into the Russian hacks. Podesta on Sunday also criticized director James Comey's actions regarding intelligence surrounding Russia's interference in the election relative to how he handled a development in the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. \n \n \"What I said was baffling, Chuck, was on October 7, as the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, Jay Johnson, director of Homeland Security, went out and said, 'The Russians are trying to interfere in our election,' Director Comey counseled against that. He said, 'I don't want the F.B.I.'s name on that,'\" Podesta said. \"Then three weeks later, he went out and dropped the infamous letter just 11 days before the election, saying that he was going to take yet another look at Hillary Clinton's emails because of the laptop that he had gotten from Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner. So how can you have that both ways?\" \n \n Podesta said that ahead of tomorrow's Electoral College vote cementing Trump's victory, \"the question is whether there are 37 Republican electors who think that either there are open questions or that Donald Trump, based on everything we know about him, is really unfit to be president of the United States.\" \n \n Podesta indicated that he was aware of calls for Clinton's electors to support someone like John Kasich or Mitt Romney in order to entice those 37 Republican electors away from Trump, but that he assumed Clinton's electors were going to vote for her. \n \n \"It's not really what the Democrats are going to do. And I guess we'll know about it tomorrow,\" Podesta said.",

Podesta also revealed that he wasn't contacted by the FBI until two days after WikiLeaks released his emails, Politico reports. \"The first thing the agent said to me is, 'I don't know if you're aware, but your email account might have been hacked,'\" Podesta said. \"I said, 'Yes, I was aware of that.'\" \"That was the last time I talked to the FBI,\" Podesta added.

I said, yes, I was aware of that,\" John Podesta told Chuck Todd on Meet the Press on Sunday.

John McCain\u2019s war record. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Trump holds 18 percent support among Republicans in a CNN/ORC International Poll released Sunday morning. Jeb Bush follows in second place with 15 percent. \n \n Since a similar poll in late June, Trump\u2019s support has risen 6 percentage points. \n \n \u201cThere's a movement going on, this is more than me,\u201d Trump said while discussing the latest poll results Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cPeople are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington I can't say I\u2019m unhappy or anything, I'm just not that surprised.\u201d \n \n The poll also found that most Republican voters want Donald Trump to remain in the GOP presidential race. \n \n Fifty two percent of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want the outspoken real estate magnate to stay in the race, according to the CNN/ORC poll. \n \n Thirty three percent want him to drop out, however, and 15 percent say he should run as an independent. \n \n Trump told The Hill in an exclusive interview last week that he would consider a third-party run if RNC leaders were unfair to him during the primary process. \n \n Among all respondents, 40 percent expect former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to be the Republican nominee. \n \n Eighteen percent think Trump will be the nominee and 11 percent think Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will emerge as the GOP nominee. \n \n Thirty one percent of Republicans, however, expect Bush to represent the party in 2016. Twenty two percent predicted Trump will be the nominee and 14 percent selected Walker. \n \n The poll of 1,017 adults was conducted between July 22 and 25th, after Trump mocked McCain\u2019s time as a prisoner of war, drawing condemnation from a broad spectrum of Republicans. The poll has a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. \n \n --Sarah Ferris contributed to this report, which was updated at 11:41 a.m. ||||| (CNN) In the first national telephone poll since Donald Trump earned rebukes from Republican leaders over his comments about Senator John McCain's military service, the real estate mogul has increased his support among GOP voters and now stands atop the race for the party's nomination. \n \n The new CNN/ORC Poll finds Trump at 18% support among Republicans, with former Florida governor Jeb Bush just behind at 15%, within the poll's margin of error. \n \n They are joined at the top of the pack by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with 10% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are registered to vote. Trump's backing has climbed 6 points since a late-June poll, while support for Bush and Walker has not changed significantly. \n \n None of the other 14 candidates tested in the new CNN/ORC survey earned double-digit support. \n \n Though Trump currently tops the race for the nomination, his advantage is by no means firm. A majority of Republican voters, 51%, say they see the field as wide open, and that it's too soon to say which candidate they will ultimately get behind. Among that group that see the contest as wide open, Bush has 14% support, while Trump has the backing of 13% and Walker stands at 9%. \n \n Trump does much better among those Republicans who say they've narrowed it down to one or two candidates, 24% of that group backs him, 16% Bush and 12% Walker. \n \n Trump's popularity among Republican voters does not translate to the broader pool of registered voters. When tested in hypothetical general election matchups against top Democrats, he trails both frontrunner Hillary Clinton and upstart Senator Bernie Sanders by wide margins. Bush and Walker run just behind Clinton and about even with Sanders. \n \n Trump's unfavorability rating is sky high. Overall, 59% of all registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, though that dips to 42% among GOP voters. \n \n None of the other Republicans landing near the top of the field have such a negative image nationwide, though many remain little known. \n \n Clinton is the only candidate who is about as well-known as Trump, and while she is more well-liked than the developer, her favorability rating is net negative among registered voters nationally: 49% have an unfavorable view while 44% have a positive impression. \n \n Still, the poll suggests Republican voters haven't yet had their fill of Trump. A majority (52%) say they'd like to see Trump continue his run for the GOP nomination, including nearly six in 10 conservatives, tea party supporters and white evangelicals. Even among those Republican voters who support someone other than Trump, 42% say they'd like him to remain in the field. \n \n The Republican electorate is more enthusiastic about next year's vote than the Democrats are. The poll finds 46% of Democratic voters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president next year, compared with 55% of Republican voters. But enthusiasm is down in both parties compared with June of 2011, when 61% of Republican registered voters and 55% of Democratic registered voters were that enthusiastic. \n \n In another positive sign for Trump's candidacy, among those Republicans who are enthusiastic about voting next year, Trump holds a larger edge over his competition: 22% say they would back him for their party's nomination, compared with 14% who back Bush and 12% behind Walker. \n \n Overall, about three-quarters of Republicans are satisfied with their choices, more so than in 2011 at this time (about two-thirds were satisfied then), but still, just 23% say they are \"very satisfied\" with the field. \n \n Meanwhile, an NBC News/Marist poll on Sunday showed Trump leading among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and narrowly trailing Walker in Iowa. \n \n Trump took 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary vote, with Bush running second at 14%, while in Iowa Trump was at 17% and Walker at 19%, according to the NBC/Marist survey \n \n On the Democratic side, the CNN poll found Clinton remains the clear frontrunner, though Sanders has increased his support slightly since last month's poll. Clinton is backed by 56% of registered Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, while Sanders has inched up to 19% from 15% in June. The rest of the field is about even with where they were before. \n \n The CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted July 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,017 adults, including 898 registered voters. Results for all registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The registered voter sample included 419 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents as well as 392 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.",

Of note: The poll was conducted after Trump started swinging at John McCain's war record, indicating he's emerged unscathed; the new poll puts Trump up 6 points over a similar poll at the end of June. \"There's a movement going on,\" Trump told CNN this morning in response, per the Hill. \"People are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington ... I'm just not that surprised.\" Trump is racking up similar numbers in Iowa, per an NBC/Marist poll out today: He's at 17%, though he's trailing Walker's 19% in that state, reports Politico. Bush has 12% there. The story is a little more marked in New Hampshire, where Trump is pulling down 21% to Bush's 14% and Walker's 12%.

    "document": "(CNN) Maddy Wilford, a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, teared up before speaking Monday at Broward Health North, the hospital where she was taken after being shot at least three times on February 14. \n \n \"I'd just like to say that I'm so grateful to be here, and it wouldn't be possible without those officers and first responders and these amazing doctors,\" said Wilford, who underwent several surgeries at the hospital and was released Wednesday. \n \n With her long brown hair swept back from her face and wearing a team jacket and a cast on her left arm, Wilford noted \"all the love that's been passed around\" and added, \"I definitely wouldn't be here without it. I'm glad I'm making a full recovery, and everything's going so smoothly.\" \n \n At Monday's news conference, the first responders and doctors at Broward North also recalled the Valentine's Day shooting. \n \n 'We were almost dumbfounded' \n \n Lt. Laz Ojeda of Coral Springs Fire Department was one of the team of first responders who transported Wilford from the school to the hospital. \n \n \"That day started like any other day,\" Ojeda said. \"When the call came in, we were almost dumbfounded. We couldn't believe it.\" \n \n They weren't dispatched right away, so their captain took the initiative and sent Ojeda's crew to the scene. There, he found the \"organized chaos\" in which he is accustomed to working. \n \n When Wilford was brought to them, Ojeda said, they thought she was dead. \n \n \"She looked very pale,\" he said. After another officer shook her, \"I believe she gasped, or she moved. She made signs of life.\" \n \n The emergency meant the team was operating under a specific set of transportation rules, so he was supposed to take her to Broward General, 30 miles from the school. Broward North, though, was just 10 minutes away. \n \n \"I looked at her, I gave her a sternal rub, and I said, 'Hey, how old are you?' \" Wilford showed no response. He asked a second time, and she whispered that she was 17. \n \n \"We're going to North Broward,\" Ojeda redirected the crew. There, \"I've never seen so many doctors, so many staff in the emergency room.\" \n \n Emotion was evident in his face and his voice as he explained: \"We transferred her to a gurney, gave a report to the nurse, and we went back to work.\" \n \n At the hospital: 'We were ready' \n \n Dr. Evan Boyar, medical director of emergency services at Broward Health North, recalled the moment when Wilford arrived at his hospital: \"It was a seamless process. Six months ago, we had an active shooter drill, to gear up for events like this. We were ready.\" \n \n Having called a \"code green\" -- a mass-casualty event -- Boyar knew that the trauma center would receive multiple patients at once. Still, the entire hospital was prepared to treat all patients \"equally and swiftly.\" \n \n Wilford came under the care of Dr. Igor Nichiporenko, medical director of trauma services at the hospital. When she arrived, she was \"pale and not responsive. She was in shock,\" he said. He had little information but could see that she had \"multiple gunshot wounds\" to her chest, abdomen and upper sternum. \n \n \"Wounds in the chest were very severe, with massive bleeding,\" Nichiporenko said. Emergency staff gave her blood, and when they found fluid in her abdomen, she was taken to the operating room within 10 minutes. \n \n Nichiporenko had to perform \"damage control,\" amounting to extricating bullets and repairing damage, first in Wilford's abdomen and then her chest and in the right upper extremity, where tendons had been \"shattered from gunshot wounds.\" \n \n \"Because we are a trauma center, we see these type of injuries almost every other day,\" he said of her bullet wounds. However, most gunshot injuries he sees are from small-caliber bullets, yet Wilford's injuries were caused by large caliber. \n \n \"There's a blast injury associated with larger caliber,\" he explained. \"When the bullet travels through soft tissue, it creates shock waves,\" and this causes more tissue damage than smaller-caliber bullets do. \n \n \"She still has fragments inside,\" Nichiporenko said, yet \"her chest and abdomen are completely healed.\" Her \"right upper extremity needs four to six weeks to heal\" due to tendon damage, and after that, she will require occupational therapy. Still, he expects a full recovery for the young basketball player. \n \n Asked whether Ojeda's call to take her to Broward North instead of the more distant hospital saved Wilford's life, Nichiporenko said, simply, \"yes, of course.\" \n \n \"Her hospital stay was less than seven days,\" Nichiporenko said. \"Young people have a tendency to heal very fast. She's very, very lucky.\" \n \n Her parents echoed that thought and expressed their gratitude to the first responders and hospital staff. \n \n A 'very grateful' family \n \n Maddy's father, David Wilford, said, \"I am very grateful to be sitting here next to my daughter, who is alive and well today. \n \n \"There's a lot of people to thank for Maddy's life,\" he said, adding that he has \"a lot of sympathy and empathy for her classmates\" and for the parents of the children who didn't make it. \n \n Missy Wilford, Maddy's mother, said, \"I too am very grateful to be sitting here today. ... My heart is full of gratitude.\" \n \n She described her daughter as \"a fighter\" who wants to heal. \n \n Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n \"Yes, it is a tragedy, but I would like to find a way to find a positive in what has happened here in our community,\" said Missy Wilford, who recognized \"the power of prayer\" and the outpouring of concern from both those she knows and those she does not. \"I may not have met you, but your prayers were felt.

Her mother, Missy, said the family was grateful both for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit and for the efforts of the doctors and emergency workers who saved her. \n \n \u201cMadeleine is healing her wounds right now, but we\u2019ll be healing emotionally for a while,\u201d Missy Wilford said. \n \n Lieutenant Ojeda said Ms. Wilford had been given a chest seal and an emergency bandage by a SWAT officer after the shooting. Working in the back of an ambulance, he decided to take her to Broward Health North, about 10 miles away. ||||| (CNN) As they sped away from the shooting scene at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the first responder was skeptical. \n \n Lt. Laz Ojeda of the Coral Springs Fire Department had been told that his patient, Maddy Wilford, was 15 years old. She had been shot at least three times in the February 14 mass shooting, and she'd lost so much blood first responders initially feared she was dead. \n \n But Ojeda thought she was older than 15 and roused her to make sure. Conscious for a second, she whispered she was 17. \n \n That made all the difference. \n \n Instead of taking her to a hospital with a children's facility some 30 miles away as he had been instructed to do, Ojeda made the decision to take Maddy to a hospital just 10 miles from the high school. The gutsy, split-second call probably saved her life. \n \n Read More",

But an observant Coral Springs Fire Department lieutenant asked the teen an important question as they prepared to whisk her away, and it was one that ended up saving her life. Per CNN, Maddy was in such bad shape when she was brought to Lt. Laz Ojeda and his rescue team that they initially thought she'd already died. \"Signs of life,\" however, soon emerged, and after a Broward County Sheriff's Office SWAT team member sealed up a chest wound, they readied her to go to a children's hospital 30 miles away, where they'd been instructed to take the 15-year-old. Except Ojeda wasn't convinced she was only 15. And so, as Ojeda tearfully relayed at a Monday presser, he asked the girl twice how old she was; she finally answered she was 17. Based on that info, Ojeda, who thought she'd die before they got her to the children's facility, made the call to take her to a hospital just 10 miles from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. There, operating surgeon Dr. Igor Nichiporenko quickly did \"damage control\" on the badly injured teen, who'd been shot in the abdomen, chest, and upper sternum, with tendons \"shattered from gunshot wounds.\" Astonishingly, Wilford was out of the hospital in less than a week. \"Young people have a tendency to heal very fast,\" Nichiporenko says, per the New York Times. \"She's very, very lucky.\" He adds that Ojeda's decision saved Maddy's life. Ojeda is just glad he was there to make the call. \"I thank God for allowing us to be an instrument in this miracle,\" he told CNN Tuesday. As for Maddy? \"I'm so grateful to be here,\" she said at the news conference, per CNN.",

    "document": "US Airways said late Wednesday that it is working with federal officials to investigate a newspaper report that three commuter jets narrowly averted a midair collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport outside the nation's capital. \n \n The Washington Post is reporting ( http://wapo.st/M4SGOO) that three US Airways jets carrying 192 passengers and crew members came within seconds of a midair collision on Tuesday afternoon. The newspaper cites federal officials with direct knowledge of the incident. \n \n The newspaper reported that air traffic controllers cleared two outbound flights to head in the direction of an incoming plane. Controllers were reversing the path of planes coming into the airport in response to an approaching storm, but the paper reports that the information wasn't fully relayed. The planes all reached their destinations safely. \n \n The Post reports that the FAA issued a statement saying it is investigating the matter and would address the communication lapse. \n \n An FAA representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday night by The Associated Press. \n \n USAirways spokesman Todd Lehmacher said in an email that the airline is \"currently investigating and working with the FAA to determine what occurred. The safety of our customers and employees is always our top priority.\" He had no other details. ||||| Three commuter jets came within seconds of a midair collision at Reagan National Airport on Tuesday after confused air traffic controllers launched two outbound flights directly at another plane coming in to land, according to federal officials with direct knowledge of the incident. \n \n The three planes, all operated by US Airways, carried 192 passengers and crew members, the airline said. All of the flights reached their destinations without mishap, but the near-collision was another among several thousand recorded errors by air traffic controllers nationwide in recent years. \n \n National has been the site of some of the most notable incidents, including one revealed last year in which the lone controller supervisor on duty was asleep and didn\u2019t respond when regional controllers sought to hand off planes to National for the final approach. \n \n The problem Tuesday occurred about 2 p.m. as a number of inbound planes were queued up to turn above Mount Vernon, fly north over the Potomac River and land on National\u2019s main runway. But an approaching storm caused a significant wind shift, and the air traffic control center in Warrenton wanted to reverse the flow of planes into the airport, turning them north of Rosslyn and routing them south along the river to land from the opposite direction. \n \n The Warrenton controllers communicated the plan to the controller tower at National. \n \n \u201cThe tower agreed, but they didn\u2019t pass it on to all the people they needed to pass it on to,\u201d said a federal official familiar with the incident who was not authorized to speak publicly. \n \n As a result, an incoming flight that had been cleared to land was flying head-on at two planes that had just taken off. The inbound plane and the first of the outbound planes were closing the 1.4 miles between them at a combined speed of 436 mph, a rate that meant they were about 12 seconds from impact when the tower controller recognized her mistake. \n \n Hours after being alerted to the incident by The Washington Post, the FAA\u2019s public affairs office issued a statement Wednesday night saying that it is investigating the matter and will take appropriate action to address the miscommunication. \n \n \u201cAre you with me?\u201d the tower controller asked the inbound pilot, checking to see whether he was tuned to her radio frequency. When the pilot acknowledged her, she ordered him to make an abrupt turn to the south to avoid the other two planes. \n \n \u201cWe were cleared [for landing] at the river there,\u201d the pilot said after breaking off the approach northwest of the airport. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n \n After a pause, the controller said, \u201cStand by, we\u2019re trying to figure this out.\u201d \n \n As she directed him to make a loop around the airport for a second landing attempt the pilot cautioned: \u201cWe really don\u2019t have enough fuel here for this. We have to get on the ground pretty quick.\u201d \n \n The federal official who reviewed the incident said what appeared to be a basic failure to communicate the planned change to everyone in the National tower was compounded by sloppy procedures. \n \n \u201cThis is a pretty big screw-up for a major airport,\u201d the person said. \n \n The official likened proper procedure to that of two flag men using radios to direct a single lane of traffic around a highway construction zone. \n \n \u201cThey say, \u2018You\u2019re good to go after the yellow pickup truck gets there,\u2019 \u201d the official said. \u201cWhen we change the direction of operation because of a wind shift, we\u2019re supposed to give the specific call sign of the last plane. They didn\u2019t use call signs [at National]. They didn\u2019t do the coordination well.\u201d \n \n The world governed by air traffic controllers is split into three layers. Control centers handle planes at cruising altitude, terminal radar approach control, or Tracon, facilities work with pilots at lower altitudes, and airport control towers handle final landing approaches and takeoffs. \n \n Commercial flight is a sequence of handoffs between controllers working the three levels. On Tuesday, Potomac Tracon in Warrenton contacted the National tower to suggest that planes land in the opposite direction to accommodate the wind shift. \n \n News of the sleeping controller at National last year led to the revelation that controllers on overnight shifts at several other airports were napping on the job. The FAA suspended or fired several controllers for sleeping on the job last year, and the controversy contributed to the ouster of the head of the FAA\u2019s air traffic control organization. \n \n Another incident involving National Airport drew attention to errors made by controllers. In 2010, an airliner carrying Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) swerved to avoid another jet when the planes got so close that an onboard collision avoidance system was activated. \n \n The FAA said that it recorded 1,234 operational errors in fiscal 2009 and that the number jumped to 1,887 in 2010, although there were more than a million fewer flights that year. The overwhelming majority of those incidents in which controllers allowed planes to get to close to one another did not put passengers at risk, but there were enough more-serious events that the National Transportation Safety Board stepped in to review them. \n \n One that the safety agency scrutinized was a relatively minor mistake involving a plane with first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, the wife of the vice president, onboard. \n \n Other cases the NTSB reviewed were more serious: A Boeing 737 nearly hit a helicopter while taking off from Houston; a Boeing 777 skimmed under a small plane on takeoff from San Francisco; a Boeing 737 nearly collided with a Cessna in Burbank, Calif.; an Airbus 319 passed 100 feet above the path of a Boeing 747 taking off in Anchorage; and an Embraer 135 taking off from Chicago took evasive action to avoid an in-bound twin-engine prop plane.",

The Laguna Beach Police Department did not provide details but said that the death does not appear to be suspicious. \n \n LRG \u2013 short for Lifted Research Group \u2013 both supports and is supported by a community of musicians, artists and athletes who have donned the company's clothing. According to LRG, the company's clothes have been worn by celebrities from Kobe Bryant and Reggie Bush to Kanye West and John Legend to Quentin Tarantino and Tom Arnold. \n \n Entrepreneur magazine reported the company had sales of $5 million in 2002 and $150 million in 2006, earning it the No. 5 spot on the publication's 500 fastest growing companies. \n \n LRG co-founders Robert Wright and Charlie Moothart in a statement posted on the company's website Tuesday night described Bevacqua as a \"visionary\" who served as a \"friend, partner, father, mentor and very caring person.\" \n \n \"Jonas was a star who burned brightly in the sky and who is gone too soon,\" the statement read. \"There is a hole in our hearts that will never be filled. He will always be loved and missed by his friends, family and those he inspired.\" \n \n Those sentiments were shared among online followers as news spread of Bevacqua's death. \n \n \"A true fashion pioneer,'' wrote an admirer on Twitter. \n \n \"RIP Jonas Bevacqua. Your accomplishments and trend setting ways inspired many,'' wrote another. \n \n The early years of Bevacqua's life were spent in Long Beach, but when he got into high school, his family moved to Laguna Beach. These two cultures were very different to him \u2013 the streets of Long Beach and the beaches of Laguna \u2013 and it helped shape him. He took to skating and surfing rather than team sports. \n \n His family is a veritable melting pot. Bevacqua, who is U.S-born Vietnamese, was adopted along with six others by Helen and Joe Bevacqua, who also have one biological son. He has a black brother and sister, Filipino brother and sister, half-white-half black sister, half Jamaican-half-Spanish brother and a white brother. \n \n \"I grew up in a pretty unique environment and was exposed to a lot of different things,\" Bevacqua told the Register in 2009. \"I didn't feel there was a clothing company to bridge the gap among all these different things that we were into \u2013 that spoke for that melting pot of what was going on. That's what LRG was all about.\" \n \n After high school, he tried out college. \n \n \"I did two semesters but probably showed up like three times,\" Bevacqua said. \n \n He drifted around California for a couple of years and spent time in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In 1999, he decided he wanted to start a clothing company. \n \n Bevacqua moved back in with his parents in Laguna Beach to start LRG. He worked as a valet during the day and at night he was a DJ at local clubs. His parents helped him get a computer for work. \n \n He met Robert Wright while working as a DJ. Wright had a college education and experience working for O'Neill, a surf clothing brand, and he delivered all that knowledge to Bevacqua. They received some investor funding from Charlie Moothart and Ronnie Ghenender and LRG was born. \n \n They started out with some sketches and ideas working out of Bevacqua's bedroom as he learned how to design and get clothes made. \n \n \"I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I definitely needed to get stuff made. We put together this game plan. I had to get some hats embroidered. So, I found some place local to us in Santa Ana,\" Bevacqua said. \n \n Design at LRG is all about the message. Sometimes the message is about wit or humor and other times it's about a state of mind. The \"Lifted\" in Lifted Research Group, for example, can reference an elevated state of mind. Some of the messages LRG delivered over the years include: Make Jeans, Not War; Underground Inventive, Overground Effective; Equipment For Life's Journey; The Underachievers. \n \n One message LRG revisits from time to time holds particular personal meaning to Bevacqua. Adopt Children, Not Style. \n \n \"That's my life story,\" Bevacqua said. \n \n Bevacqua is survived by his fianc\u00e9, son, seven siblings and his mother and father, LRG officials said. ||||| Jonas Bevacqua, who co-founded the popular street clothing brand LRG in 1999 and presided over its rapid rise as a major fashion force among young people, was found dead Tuesday. He was 34. \n \n Orange County sheriff's officials said Bevacqua's body was found in his Laguna Beach home. \n \n \"There were no obvious signs of the cause of death,\" sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino told The Associated Press. He added that the county coroner would conduct an autopsy Wednesday. \n \n A statement on Irvine-based LRG's website describes Bevacqua as a friend, partner, father and mentor. \n \n \"We ask that everyone keep his family in their hearts and prayers and respect their privacy in this time of incredible grief,\" the statement reads in part. \n \n According to the company's Facebook page, Bevacqua and his business partner, Robert Wright, founded Lifted Research Group, known to patrons as LRG, with start-up capital raised in part from friends of Bevacqua's adoptive father. \n \n Bevacqua had dropped out of college and moved back home with his parents when he met Wright while working as a DJ at Southern California clubs. The two sketched out some of their earliest fashion ideas in his bedroom. \n \n Deeply influenced by Southern California's skateboard, surfing and hip hop culture, he said he and Wright began making clothes that reflected their interests but that no one else seemed to be providing. \n \n \"I grew up in a pretty unique environment and was exposed to a lot of different things,\" he said in a 2009 interview with the Orange County Register. \"I didn't feel there was a clothing company to bridge the gap between all these different things that we were into _ that spoke for that melting pot of what was going on.

Among its popular clothing lines are Luxirie, which targets 18- to 30-year-old women, offering clothing with Western and military themes, and items such as crystal-covered jeans. \n \n Initially a clothing company, LRG has since branched out to include sales of electronic devices, music and other items. It described itself as a \"creative lifestyle\" company that attempts to reflect its founders' interests, not only in fashion but also environmental causes and other activities. \n \n \"The company is also involved in the promotion of underground recording artists and sponsors a skateboarding team,\" according to its website. \n \n In the 2009 Register interview, Bevacqua described a passionate but casual work ethic that he said drives LRG, whose headquarters includes a basketball court and skateboard half-bowl and ramp. \n \n \"No one is really a suit-and-tie-guy,\" he said of LRG's employees. \"If anybody wears a suit, it's because he wants to, not because he has to.\" \n \n Bevacqua is survived by his mother, father, son, fiancee and seven siblings, according to the company's website.",

    "document": "Were you affected by Hurricane Michael? Text, iMessage or WhatsApp your videos, photos and stories to CNN when it's safe: 347-322-0415 \n \n (CNN) The devastation left by Hurricane Michael in several states is still coming into focus, with coastal Florida cities destroyed beyond recognition, and homes, businesses and agriculture torn or swamped from Georgia to Virginia. \n \n More than 1 million customers were left without electricity, and emergency officials have no access to many towns. The US death toll has risen to at least 17 -- including five in Virginia and eight in Florida -- and it's expected to climb. \n \n \"I expect the fatality count to rise today and tomorrow as we get through the debris,\" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long said Friday morning. \n \n Michael, which smacked Florida's Panhandle as one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the United States, left Virginia's coast as a post-tropical low early Friday -- and its trail of destruction will take weeks to take into account. \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson called the devastation left by Michael \"the worst destruction that the Panhandle has seen for however long that I've been living. It's akin to Hurricane Andrew in 1992 where everything was leveled.\" \n \n Aerial footage shows coastal cities in the Panhandle, like Mexico Beach , wiped out. Search teams used dogs as they combed the area for people killed or trapped in debris. \n \n One death was reported in Mexico Beach -- that of an elderly man found alone, Mayor Al Cathey said. The man's name has not been released, but authorities said his body was found several hundred yards away from his home. \n \n City manager Tanya Castro said Mexico Beach won't be up and running for 12 to 18 months. \n \n Nelson said there are not enough resources -- food, shelter and water -- for those in Mexico Beach who stayed and for those residents returning. In Panama City, he said \"there's going to be a period of time that it's difficult to get supplies in.\" \n \n Dawn Vickers rode out the storm in Mexico Beach, but her house and vehicles were demolished. Without cell phone service or transportation, she has been taking shelter in one of the few condos left standing, invited by someone she met at what's left of a gas station. \n \n \"This has been the worst nightmare I've ever been through in my life,\" she told CNN on Friday. \n \n A psychiatric hospital in Florida is isolated after downed trees blocked roads around Chattahoochee, and a tree caused a water line to break. The facility is running on power generators, and helicopters have delivered food and water, the state's Department of Children and Families said. \n \n Photos: In pictures: Hurricane Michael's trail of destruction President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Florida Gov.

One of those deaths was due to debris, authorities said, and circumstances of the other two deaths were not immediately known. Five people died in Virginia. Four of those drowned, and the fifth was a firefighter who died in a storm-related crash on Interstate 295 in Hanover County, officials said. Three people in North Carolina and a child in Georgia also died. \n \n \u2022 Severe crop damage: Georgia officials are receiving reports of damage to pecan, cotton, vegetable and peanut crops. \"For me the cotton crop is as bad as it gets. I was picking three bale cotton (this week); today it is gone,\" cotton farmer and state Rep. Clay Pirkle said. \"Can't tell the difference between what I've picked and what I haven't.\" \n \n \u2022 Poultry industry: Georgia's Department of Agriculture said it received reports that Georgia's Department of Agriculture said it received reports that 84 chicken houses -- estimated to hold more than 2 million chickens -- were destroyed in the storm. \n \n \u2022 Public health emergency declared in Georgia: The move will help ensure those who rely on Medicare and Medicaid have access to the care they need, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. \n \n Mexico Beach was one of the hardest hit areas by Hurricane Michael. \n \n Flooding in the Carolinas and Virginia \n \n The rapid-moving rainfall from Michael triggered flash floods in parts of Virginia and the Carolinas, including areas threatened by swollen rivers during Hurricane Florence. \n \n Hundreds of residents were rescued Thursday from cars, apartments and homes flooded by rushing water. \n \n President Donald Trump tweeted his sympathy for people affected by the storm, saying, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great state of Georgia. I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next week. We are working very hard on every area and every state that was hit - we are with you!\" \n \n People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great state of Georgia. I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next week. We are working very hard on every area and every state that was hit - we are with you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2018 \n \n In Virginia, the Roanoke River jumped its banks and flooded nearby homes and businesses. Cory Patirlo, who lives near the river, said the impact was unexpected. It was the first time he had nearly 2 feet of water in his home. \n \n \"It wasn't going to get this high, realistically. It never has,\" he told CNN affiliate WDBJ. \n \n \"I'm gonna be sleeping in my van, with my dogs.\" \n \n Video that Trina Lockhart posted on Twitter showed drivers making their way cautiously though a flooded Roanoke street Thursday afternoon. \n \n In the southern Virginia city of Danville, floodwaters turned the Grove Park neighborhood into a virtual lake Thursday, and firefighters checked on a nearly submerged car, photos taken by Jim Heffinger show. \n \n The water receded within hours in some areas, and cleanup was underway Friday. Some people are expected to remain in shelters through the weekend as river levels go down. \n \n In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said first responders rescued nearly 100 people and evacuated many more this week in the face of flash flooding. \n \n Fallen trees have left hundreds of primary and secondary roads closed, he said. \n \n Florida residents return to broken homes \n \n Thousands of residents in the Florida Panhandle are slowly returning to their homes and discovering that everything or almost everything they owned has been reduced to rubble. \n \n Linda Clarke gasped repeatedly at the sight of her once new home in Shell Point Beach -- now severely damaged. \n \n \"But you know what ... it's just stuff, it's just stuff,\" she told her husband, Raoul, as they walked through the ruins. \"It's just stuff we can replace.\" \n \n There is not much left of what used to be the parish hall of St. Dominic Catholic Church in Panama City. Despite the destruction, the Rev. Luke Farabaugh and his congregation celebrated Mass on Thursday. \n \n \"Things, we can replace,\" Farabaugh said on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"We've seen a lot of signs of hope. ... I've been telling people ... to have hope. \n \n \"Hope is that even if the storm does come, even if I lose my car, my house, my family, even if I lose my life, blessed be God,\" he said. \"Our reward isn't just in this life but in the life to come. So we're just trying to give people hope at this point.\" \n \n The hurricane carried a home across a road and slammed it against a condo complex in Mexico Beach. \n \n In Mexico Beach, Councilwoman Linda Albrecht learned through online news video that her home was gone. \n \n \"Everything in my house, it was almost like it was pushed back with a bulldozer,\" she said \n \n \"Mexico Beach needs your prayers,\" Albrecht said of the town of about 1,200 people. \"It's not the Mexico Beach we know.\" \n \n But there are signs of recovery. \n \n Delta Airlines said it resumed all operations at airports impacted by Hurricane Michael, including Panama City Airport. \n \n The City of Tallahassee reported that 90% of the traffic lights in the city were back online Friday and that power had been restored to 38,000 customers. \n \n Several businesses in the city have reopened, including Walmart, Target and various gas stations. \n \n On St. George Island, a 28-mile-long and 1-mile-wide island off the Panhandle, a few dozen people didn't evacuate and as the storm raged, those who stayed were surrounded by oncoming water. Security camera video shows water creating its own current in the streets of one neighborhood. \n \n \"There were a few points and times when I thought it could happen, that I could die,\" said Tiara Walker, who stayed in an apartment on the island. \"There was a point in time where I thought the roof was going to fly away, so I flipped a couch over and just tried to prepare for the worst situation.\" \n \n 'A freak accident' \n \n Sarah Radney saw trees falling down all around her grandparents' home when Hurricane Michael roared over Georgia. She was safe until a carport came crashing through the roof , killing her. \n \n \"It was just a freak accident, I never heard of anything like that,\" said her father, Roy Radney. \n \n Sarah, 11, had just started the sixth grade and joined the drama club and the band. Her father says she loved playing the trumpet, acting and singing. \n \n A man who died when a tree fell on a home near Greensboro, Florida, has been identified as Steven Sweet, 44, according to Lt. Anglie Hightower, the spokeswoman for the Gadsden County Sheriff's Office. CNN's Anderson Cooper said Friday on \"AC360\" that Sweet managed a local car dealership. His wife, Gayle Sweet, was with him when he died. \n \n Here's what we know so far about some of the 17 and counting who did not survive Hurricane Michael https://t.co/wc4NyV6S73 pic.twitter.com/jwxTXFYF49 \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 13, 2018 \n \n \"He's one of a kind, so kind he'll help anybody. Always giving money to people at the stop sign and stuff. He would help anybody,\" Gayle Sweet said of her husband. \n \n Three others died in Gadsden County, Hightower said. Authorities did not discuss the circumstances of their deaths, but their bodies have been taken to the medical examiner's office to determine the cause of death. \n \n In North Carolina, a 38-year-old man died when a large tree fell on his vehicle Thursday on US 64 east of Statesville, Iredell County Fire Marshal David Souther said. \n \n Cooper also said Friday that firefighter Lt. Brad Clark, 43, was killed when a tractor trailer lost control on a rainy highway and hit his truck in Hanover County, Virginia. A colleague said he loved the military, loved his family and loved the fire service dearly. \n \n Two people also were killed Thursday night in Marion, North Carolina, when their vehicle struck a tree that had fallen because of high winds, said Adrienne Jones, deputy director for the McDowell County Emergency Medical Services. \n \n In Nottoway County, Virginia, state police and local authorities were searching for a missing motorist, said Jeffrey Stern, the director of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management Agency. Virginia State Police Superintendent Col. Gary Settle said crews recovered a vehicle but not the person known to be in it. \n \n Hundreds of people have been rescued from the debris, and authorities fear the toll could climb higher as search-and-rescue efforts continue. \n \n Elizabeth Hanson, right, and daughter Emaly hug their neighbor Cindy Clark in Mexico Beach. \n \n Lack of resources \n \n Sen. Nelson said Friday on \"AC360\" that Mexico Beach does not not have enough shelters, water or food. \n \n Nelson said Panama City was \"a city in the dark.\" A cavalry of utility trucks arrived Friday in Bay County, Florida, according to post from the Panama City Beach Government Facebook page. \n \n The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved individual assistance families in for Jackson, Liberty, Calhoun and Gadsden counties Friday according to a press release from Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office. \n \n The approval expands the individual assistance program \u2014 the original major disaster declaration made individual assistance available in five Florida counties: Bay, Franklin, Gulf, Taylor, Wakulla. \n \n Damage from Hurricane Michael in Marianna, Florida. \n \n Jackson County Emergency Management Director Rodney Andreassen said the county is hoping to get two or three trailers worth of food and water from FEMA but had not yet received them. \n \n A distribution center set up at a Walmart in Jackson County handed out food for a few hours Friday and will be open again Saturday. A Red Cross shelter with food and water has also been set up at Marianna High School \n \n The impact of climate change on storms \n \n Michael's strength may reflect the effect of climate change on storms. The planet has warmed significantly over the past several decades, causing changes in the environment. \n \n Human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere create an energy imbalance, with more than 90% of remaining heat trapped by the gases going into the oceans, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \n While we might not get more storms in a warmer climate, most studies show storms will get stronger and produce more rain. Storm surge is worse now than it was 100 years ago, thanks to the rise in sea levels. \n \n And unless the rate of greenhouse gas emissions changes, hurricanes are expected to intensify more rapidly in the coming decades, the scientific research group Climate Central said. \n \n Get the latest delivered to your inbox: Sign up for storm email alerts here. \n \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave the incorrect surname for storm victim Steven Sweet. It has been corrected. ||||| Hurricane Michael is no more. The violent storm that ripped through the Southeast, leaving a trail of death and destruction from Florida to Virginia, finally moved off the coast over the Atlantic Ocean overnight. It is now known as Post-Tropical Cyclone Michael. \n \n Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane \u2014 the strongest on record to hit the area \u2014 and charged north through Georgia and into the Carolinas and Virginia, wreaking havoc and causing emergencies. In the storm\u2019s wake lay crushed and flooded buildings, shattered lives and at least 11 deaths that state and local officials have linked to the storm, with authorities investigating another three deaths. \n \n 5:12 p.m.: North of Panama City, long waits for gas, food \n \n FOUNTAIN, Fla. \u2014 When everything else was closed, Buck\u2019s Piggly Wiggly Express opened with fuel and food. A line of cars extended a quarter mile, and the queue to enter the convenience store was so long, it took buyers more than 30 minutes to get in. \n \n Ann Jackson, 62, had heard the store in Fountain, Fla., about 30 miles north of Panama City, was selling water and other supplies, so she and her two daughters had rushed to it. They stood in line for 40 minutes to get in. Each family was allowed to buy 20 items and two cases of water. They had to limit their gas purchase to $15. \n \n Jackson had prepared for the hurricane with supplies for three to four days. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be a category 5 storm, she said, so she thought she had enough. Now, the drinking water was running low in their home about 20 minutes south from the store. \n \n \u201cThis wasn\u2019t our first hurricane, but it was way worse,\u201d said Jackson, who lived through Opal years ago. For that storm, she said, they were without power for seven days. Now she worries the electricity won\u2019t come back for weeks. She does have faith, she said, that the Walmart where she works will open with days and supplies will be more available. \n \n But Friday, Jackson was relieved to have found Piggly Wiggly open. She and her three daughters split up to get the shopping done, each assigned some necessities. She got water, bleach to make the toilet last longer without flushing, charcoal for the grill, plastic cups, plates and toilet paper. And a treat for her two grandchildren \u2013 a watermelon slushie. \n \n Store owner Allen Spikes said the store was luckily spared from major damage, and he was soon on task to put a generator to work to get it open. Friday, he had two semis deliver water, and as customers lined up outside, store workers continued to stock up the water shelves. He was expecting one more fuel delivery on Friday and Saturday. \n \n \u201cPeople are desperate. They need supplies,\u201d he said, as he and his wife Rachel worked the ice machine and talked to customers. \u201cI am just glad we can serve our community.\u201d \n \n Jackson and her family were grateful. \n \n \u201cThis will get us through a few more days,\u201d she said. \u201cAll this will go away. But it\u2019s going to be a long time to recover.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Luz Lazo \n \n 4:53 p.m.: Virginia continues search for missing woman \n \n The Virginia State Police said Friday afternoon that officials were continuing to search for a woman swept away when the vehicle she was riding in was stranded on a bridge along Mt. Harmony Road. The state\u2019s death toll from the storm remained five people late Friday afternoon, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 3:50 p.m.: The impact Michael left far inland \n \n Although the obliterated beachfront communities have gotten most of the media attention, rescue operations are underway far inland. Many people in the Florida Panhandle live on dirt roads now completely blocked by fallen trees. \n \n Rescue teams that can\u2019t reach rural residents by vehicle are having to go on foot, said Sean Collins, 47, a retired firefighter in Marianna, Fla. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t know if some of the elderly who live back in these woods, are they okay and have they been contacted,\u201d Collins said. \n \n Marianna is about 50 miles from the coast and took a direct hit from the eye of the storm. Buildings downtown were badly damaged. Collins estimated that 100 percent of homes and vehicles were damaged in some way. \n \n But because Marianna is so far from the coast \u2013 nearer to Alabama than to Panama City \u2013 residents did not evacuate, Collins said. \n \n \u201cNobody thought it was going to be this devastating,\u201d he said. \n \n \u2014 Joel Achenbach \n \n 2 p.m.: North Carolina, Georgia report additional storm deaths \n \n Authorities in North Carolina and Georgia confirmed additional deaths in those states, pushing the number of fatalities officials have linked to the storm to at least 11 people as of Friday afternoon, with three more deaths being investigated. \n \n North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said two people \u2014 a man and a woman \u2014 were killed in McDowell County when their car hit a large tree that had fallen on the road. State and local officials previously said a man in the state was killed Thursday when a tree fell on his car in Iredell County. \n \n \u201cWe extend our heartfelt sympathy to the loved ones and friends of those killed,\u201d Cooper said in a statement. \n \n Meanwhile, officials in Georgia confirmed that a second life had been lost there, after an 11-year-old girl in Seminole County was killed while in a mobile home when the wind hurled a metal carport into the air. The Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency on Friday morning said another person had died in the state. The agency declined to provide additional details on the death beyond saying it occurred in Wayne County. \n \n Virginia authorities said they had confirmed five deaths there and had one person still missing Friday. \n \n In Gadsden County, Fla., the sheriff\u2019s office said Thursday they had four \u201cstorm-related fatalities following Hurricane Michael,\u201d although they had only confirmed the details of one death: a man killed when a tree crashed through the roof of his home. A spokeswoman said Friday the four deaths had been forwarded to the medical examiner\u2019s office, but additional details were not immediately available. \n \n Authorities have warned that the storm\u2019s death toll was likely to climb as they were able to head into the areas \u2014 like Mexico Beach, Fla. \u2014 that endured particular damage this week. FEMA Administrator William \u201cBrock\u201d Long said he believed that the toll would increase, particularly as first responders got into places like Mexico Beach. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, I think you\u2019re going to see that number climb,\u201d Long said Friday morning. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t see it climb dramatically.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 12:10 p.m.: Five dead, one missing in Virginia after storm \n \n Five people are dead and one is still missing in Virginia after the area was hit by Hurricane Michael. In Charlotte County, three people became stranded in a vehicle on a bridge along Mt. Harmony Road, according to state police. \n \n When rescuers arrived, they were clinging to the railings of a bridge as high waters surrounded them. A local sheriff\u2019s deputy saved a 17-year-old man using a human chain with law enforcement officers, local residents and rope, officials said, but a man and a woman \u2013 who police said are related to the teenager \u2013 were swept away. Rescuers found the body of the man overnight and the woman is still missing. \n \n [Before and after images of Hurricane Michael] \n \n In Pittsylvania County, a 45-year-old man died after he was swept away from his vehicle. A sheriff\u2019s deputy and a local resident tried to rescue James E. King Jr., state police said, but the floodwaters were too deep and too swift. \n \n In Hanover County, a firefighter died and four others were injured, including three seriously, after a tractor trailer crashed into them as they tried to help with another crash involving two vehicles along Interstate 295 outside Mechanicsville, Va. \n \n And in Danville, two people died after being swept away by flood waters. One man, William Lynn Tanksley, 53, was swept from his vehicle during flash flooding at around 5 p.m. Thursday. Another person, who police have not yet identified, was stranded in a car overcome by flooding at around 10:20 p.m. \n \n \u2014 Dana Hedgpeth \n \n 10:04 a.m.: FEMA chief warns the death toll likely to climb \n \n FEMA Administrator William \u201cBrock\u201d Long said Friday morning that the death toll from Hurricane Michael is likely to go up as rescue workers are able to venture more deeply into the areas devastated by the storm. \n \n Authorities as of Friday morning had confirmed 11 deaths in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, but they have repeatedly warned that this number could go up. Long reiterated that during a news briefing in Washington, saying that authorities have yet to fully explore areas like Mexico Beach, Fla., which Long has called \u201cground zero\u201d after it was pummeled by the hurricane. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, I think you\u2019re going to see that number climb,\u201d Long said. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t see it climb dramatically. But I have reasons to believe \u2014 we haven\u2019t gotten into some of the hardest hit areas, particularly the Mexico Beach area.\u201d \n \n Long said the storm posed a direct threat to people who ignored warnings and evacuation orders on the coastlines, particularly given the threat of storm surge capable of tearing apart and flattening buildings. \n \n \u201cVery few people live to tell what it\u2019s like to experience storm surge,\u201d he said. \n \n Long asked people in the areas directly hit by the storm to be patient for what is poised to be a long recovery, because it will take time to assess the damage and confront the destruction. \n \n \u201cThis is going to be a frustrating event,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time to put things back together.\u201d \n \n Long, who plans to head to the area hit by the storm over the weekend, said that in Bay County, Fla. \u2014 home to Mexico Beach \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not safe to return,\u201d given the downed power lines and other debris littering the region. \n \n \u201cQuite honestly, it\u2019s a dangerous area to go back into,\u201d he said. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 8:55 a.m.: In final advisory, hurricane center says Michael\u2019s remnants are moving toward the sea \n \n The National Hurricane Center on Friday morning posted its final advisory for the storm formerly known as Hurricane Michael, writing that the \u201cpost-tropical cyclone\u201d was trundling northeast and heading for the Atlantic. \n \n The forecast calls for the storm\u2019s center to \u201cmove away from the United States today and move rapidly across the open Atlantic Ocean\u201d beginning Friday night and through Sunday. \n \n The storm is still expected to produce storm surge flooding along the North Carolina coast, though that should diminish Friday, along with powerful winds in the mid-Atlantic in the early part of the day. The storm is even expected to drop some rain on New England and could produce up to 5 inches of rain in Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, while flash flooding remains possible from the heavy rain left behind in the Carolinas and elsewhere in the mid-Atlantic. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 8:40 a.m.: Tyndall Air Force base \u201ctook a beating,\u201d commander says \n \n When Hurricane Michael swept ashore in northwestern Florida, it delivered a punishing shot to Tyndall Air Force base, which sits between Panama City and Mexico Beach, not far from where the storm made landfall. \n \n The \u201cbase took a beating,\u201d Col. Brian S. Laidlaw, the installation\u2019s commander and commander of the 325th Fighter Wing, wrote in a letter to the people who call it home. \n \n \u201cBy now you already know that Tyndall Air Force Base requires extensive cleanup and repairs,\u201d Laidlaw wrote. \u201cI will not recall you and your families until we can guarantee your safety.\u201d \n \n Laidlaw said he did not know how long the cleanup would take, but asked for patience because of the work involved. \n \n \u201cWe need to restore basic utilities, clear our roads of trees and power lines, and assess the structural integrity of our buildings,\u201d he wrote. He added: \u201cWe can rebuild our base, but we can\u2019t rebuild any of you.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 7:59 a.m.: Five deaths reported in Virginia \n \n The known death toll from Michael now stands at 11, after this sobering bulletin from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management: \n \n Virginia storm updates as of 7 a.m today. 5 confirmed Michael-related fatalities. 520,000 without power. 1,200 closed roads. 5 suspected tornadoes. \u2014 VDEM (@VDEM) October 12, 2018 \n \n Four of the deaths were related to people being swept away in floodwaters along roads; the fifth was a firefighter who was killed in a crash along a highway, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. \n \n In one incident, Virginia State Police said James E. King Jr., 45, of Dry Fork, Va., was swept away from his vehicle after he got caught Thursday afternoon in a flash flood in Pittsylvania County. \n \n A local sheriff\u2019s deputy and a local resident tried to rescue him but police said the \u201cfloodwaters were too deep and too swift\u201d for them to reach him. Around 10:37 p.m., his body was found. \n \n A firefighter in Hanover County was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer and three other firefighters were seriously injured as they tried to help with another crash on Interstate 295. The driver of the tractor-trailer also suffered serious injuries. \n \n Authorities in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina had previously linked at least six deaths to the storm, a toll officials have worried will continue to rise as search-and-rescue efforts continue. \n \n In Florida, the Gadsden County Sheriff\u2019s Office reported four deaths related to the storm. A spokeswoman said that one man was killed when a tree crashed through the roof of his home in Greensboro. The sheriff\u2019s office said that it also had three other \u201cstorm-related fatalities following Hurricane Michael,\u201d although it did not immediately release further information about what happened beyond saying that all four deaths were \u201cin relation to or occurred during the storm.\u201d \n \n Gadsden, a county in northwest Florida not far from Tallahassee, took a direct shot from Michael as it churned northward on Wednesday. \n \n In North Carolina, a 38-year-old man was killed Thursday afternoon shortly before 1 p.m. in Iredell County, north of Charlotte, when a tree fell on the vehicle he was driving, according to David Souther, the county\u2019s fire marshal. \n \n And in Georgia, officials in Seminole County, on the Florida border, said early Thursday that an 11-year-old girl in a mobile home was killed by a metal carport that was thrown in the air by Michael\u2019s gusting winds. \n \n William \u201cBrock\u201d Long, the FEMA administrator, said Thursday that \u201csearch and rescue is where we are hyper-focused this morning.\u201d He warned that the death toll may go up, saying in an appearance on CNN that \u201cthose numbers could climb as search-and-rescue teams get out.\u201d \n \n Motorists must adjust driving to road conditions caused by the storm. Slow down. DO NOT DRIVE ACROSS FLOODED ROADWAYS. This causes most storm-related fatalities.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) (Associated Press) \n \n MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida authorities fielded a barrage of calls about people missing in Hurricane Michael's aftermath as search-and-rescue teams Friday made their way through ravaged neighborhoods, looking for victims dead or alive. The death toll stood at 13 across the South. \n \n The number of dead was expected to rise, but authorities scrapped plans for setting up a temporary morgue, indicating they had yet to see signs of mass casualties from the most powerful hurricane to hit the continental U.S. in nearly 50 years. \n \n Search teams continued to pick their way through the ruins of Mexico Beach, the ground-zero town of about 1,000 people that was nearly wiped off the map when Michael blew ashore there on Wednesday with devastating 155 mph (249 kph) winds. \n \n State officials said that by one count, 285 people in Mexico Beach defied mandatory evacuation orders and stayed behind. Whether any of them got out at some point was unclear. \n \n Emergency officials said they have received thousands of calls asking about missing people. But with cellphone service out across vast swaths of the Florida Panhandle, officials said it is possible that some of those unaccounted for are safe and just haven't been able to contact friends or family to let them know. \n \n Gov. Rick Scott said state officials still \"do not know enough\" about the fate of those who stayed behind in the region. \n \n \"We are not completely done. We are still getting down there,\" the governor added. \n \n Emergency officials said they had done an initial \"hasty search\" of 80 percent of the stricken area, looking for the living or the dead. \n \n Shell-shocked survivors who barely escaped with their lives told of terrifying winds, surging floodwaters and homes cracking like eggs. \n \n Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long said he expects to see the death toll rise. \n \n \"We still haven't gotten into the hardest-hit areas,\" he said, adding with frustration: \"Very few people live to tell what it's like to experience storm surge, and unfortunately in this country we seem to not learn the lesson.\" \n \n Long expressed worry that people have suffered \"hurricane amnesia.\" \n \n \"When state and local officials tell you to get out, dang it, do it. Get out,\" he said. \n \n Officials, meanwhile, set up distribution centers outside big stores such as Wal-Mart and Publix to pass out food and water to victims. Some supplies were brought in by trucks, while others had to be delivered by helicopter because some roads had yet to be cleared. \n \n The deaths were spread throughout the storm's vast path, from Florida to Virginia, where at least four people drowned in flooding caused by Michael's rainy remnants. Two died in North Carolina when a car smashed into a fallen tree. \n \n On the Panhandle, Tyndall Air Force Base \"took a beating,\" so much so that Col. Brian Laidlaw told the 3,600 men and women stationed on the base not to come back. Many of the 600 families who live there had followed orders to pack what they could in a single suitcase as they were evacuated. \n \n A small \"ride-out\" team that hunkered down as the hurricane's eyewall passed directly overhead ventured out to find nearly every building severely damaged, many a complete loss. The elementary school, the flight line, the marina and the runways were devastated. \n \n ___ \n \n Contributors in Florida include Associated Press writers Jay Reeves in Panama City, Brendan Farrington in St. Marks, Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, and Jennifer Kay and Freida Frisaro in Miami.

As has been well reported by now, the coastal community was decimated by the storm, and authorities are now trying to figure out how many of those 285 survived. Similar situations exist elsewhere in the state, and Florida officials are fielding scores of calls from worried loved ones. Still, with cellphone service down throughout wide areas, rescue officials are holding out hope that the missing are fine and simply haven't been able to get in touch yet. As of Friday afternoon, CNN had the death toll at 13: Five in Virginia, four in Florida, three in North Carolina, and one (an 11-year-old girl) in Georgia. \u201cUnfortunately, I think you\u2019re going to see that number climb,\u201d said FEMA Administrator William \u201cBrock\u201d Long Friday morning. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t see it climb dramatically.\u201d As for the storm itself, the Washington Post notes that Michael is now Post-Tropical Cyclone Michael and has moved out to sea.

    "document": "It\u2019s on. Subscribers to popular streaming services, including XBox Live and Spotify, have filed a lawsuit that claims the city of Chicago\u2019s controversial tax policy on digital entertainment is illegal. \n \n The challenge to the tax policy, filed last week in Cook County state court, is important because it could help define the power of cities and states to tax parts of the internet economy. \n \n The controversy turns on Chicago\u2019s recent decision to extend its existing 9% \u201cAmusement\u201d levy, which applies to events like shows and baseball games, to a wide range of online services. \n \n In their court challenge, a group of Chicago residents claim the city comptroller\u2019s decision to apply the Amusement tax to streaming service amounted to a new tax that could only have been imposed by a vote of city officials. They claim they are being harmed since the tax makes them pay more for Amazon Prime (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Hulu, Xbox Live (MSFT) and Spotify. \n \n In a claim that may have national significance, the lawsuit also says the Chicago streaming tax violates the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act, which forbids states and cities from imposing discriminatory internet-only taxes. Specifically, the Chicago subscribers claim the tax is illegal because it treats streaming differently from DVD-by-mail services and also imposes a higher rate than various live forms of entertainment. \n \n The city says it will fight the lawsuit vigorously, according to the Chicago Tribune, which also reports the so-called \u201cNetflix tax\u201d is expected to bring in $12 million annually, and that it is part of a larger attempt by Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to use new fees to close a budget hole. \n \n The lawsuit, which you can read for yourself below, also comes as more states and cities are looking to tax the cloud to make up for a decline in sales tax revenue. That decline has come about in part because consumers are acquiring a wide variety of goods and services, including media, online rather than in stores. \n \n While cloud taxes offer the promise of new money for local governments, they are also proving to be a major headache for many businesses, which are unclear of when and how to collect the tax. The confusion could produce additional court challenges, in part because the taxes often affect cloud-based businesses outside of the city or state in question. \n \n While the Supreme Court requires a \u201cphysical nexus\u201d for a local tax to be valid, city and state governments appear to taking a more aggressive approach when it comes to defining that nexus. According to Rebecca Newton-Clarke, a tax expert with Thomson Reuters, the governments are likely to continue pushing the definition of nexus in the absence of further clarification from the Supreme Court. \n \n In the meantime, consumers in more places are likely to face new fees on their favorite streaming entertainment. \n \n Chicago Tax Complaint \n \n If want to learn more about taxes and tech, here is a recent clip of Senator Charles Schumer talking about fixing the tax code: \n \n Subscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the business of technology. ||||| Streaming-media customers in Chicago filed a lawsuit last week that could have major implications for how cities and states tax Internet services. \n \n The lawsuit, filed Sept. 9 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleges that Chicago's new tax on Internet streaming companies like Netflix and Spotify violated city policy and unfairly punishes them for being customers of those sites. But it also argues that Chicago lacks the authority to tax Internet services at all, a charge that could turn this lawsuit into a national issue. \n \n Chicago's comptroller on June 9 extended an existing 9-percent tax on \"amusement\" activities, like sporting events, to streaming services, but postponed implementation of the tax until Jan. 1 to help companies prepare for it. \n \n The plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit that Chicago's \"amusement\" tax did not \"authorize a tax on video services streamed from the Internet, which may be provided anywhere, to customers with residency or billing address in the City of Chicago who might use those services, partially or entirely, outside of the City.\" \n \n There is also the question of whether Chicago's tax comports with the Internet Tax Freedom Act. That law, amended in 2014 to ban \"discriminatory\" online taxes, could prevent Chicago from taxing Netflix's streaming service but not its original video-by-mail service. \n \n \"The Amusement Tax,\" according to the lawsuit, \"also unlawfully discriminates against electronic commerce because it imposes a higher tax rate on theatrical, musical, and cultural performances that are delivered through an online streaming service than it imposes on those same performances if they are consumed in person.\" \n \n If the Illinois state court agrees with the plaintiffs, it could set a major precedent for local taxation of Internet companies. \n \n The lawsuit's other major charge is that the city illegally implemented the tax through a decision of its Finance Department instead of submitting the policy change to a city council vote. \"The Municipal Code,\" the lawsuit said, \"does not ... authorize the Comptroller to impose new taxes that the City Council has not authorized through a city ordinance.\" \n \n The lawsuit also suggested that the new streaming tax \"injures the Plaintiffs because their costs for these services have increased, or will imminently increase, by 9 percent.\" \n \n Among the plaintiffs are subscribers to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Xbox Live, and Hulu. The lawsuit alleged that most of these customers were harmed simply by having to pay a higher subscription cost. In the case of the Amazon Prime subscribers\u2014whose subscriptions cover not only streaming media but also faster shipping and other perks\u2014the complaint went further: \n \n [T]hey must pay the tax on Internet-based video and music services portion of the price of their membership, but if Amazon does not separate the price of these services from its non-taxable services, then they must paid the Amusement Tax on the full price of their Amazon Prime membership, either of which will increase the cost of subscribing to Amazon Prime \n \n The lawsuit also took special note of Xbox Live, which provides access to services related to gaming, communication, cloud storage, and broadcasting, none of which, it said, fit within the language of the \"amusement\" tax. \n \n H/T Fortune | Photo via Philip Taylor/Flickr (CC BY 2.0) ||||| Chicago's move to extend its taxing power to Internet streaming services like Netflix and Spotify has been challenged in court by a group that argues the city didn't have the authority to create what amounts to new taxes. \n \n In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County Circuit Court, the nonprofit Liberty Justice Center says the city Finance Department's rulings in June extending two taxes were illegal. \n \n The department posted letters online announcing that the city was extending the 9 percent amusement tax to include paid subscriptions for streamed digital music, rental movies, TV shows and games, and also extending the personal property lease transaction tax to professional services like electronic property databases used by real estate agents. \n \n The ruling applied the new standards to subscribers with Chicago addresses, and city officials said they expected the changes to bring in about $12 million annually in the latest example of Mayor Rahm Emanuel boosting various smaller fees and fines to try to help close the city's gaping budget hole. \n \n The lawsuit argues that aldermen should have gotten to vote on the changes. \n \n \"The Comptroller has exceeded his authority under the ordinance by issuing a rule that imposes a new tax that the City Council did not authorize in enacting the Amusement Tax,\" the suit reads. \n \n \"No aldermen voted on this tax. It never went before the Chicago City Council, which makes the so-called 'Netflix tax' an illegal tax,\" Jeffrey Schwab, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center, said in a news release Thursday. \"If the city wants to tax Internet-based streaming media services, then it should put the measure through the political process, and let Chicagoans have their voices heard through the democratic process.\" \n \n The suit also argues that the levies violate the federal Internet Freedom Tax Act because they tax some Internet-based streaming media at a higher rate than similar services not delivered via the Internet. \n \n The city's Law Department released a statement saying it intends to vigorously fight the lawsuit. \n \n \"The City has not yet seen the complaint, but we are confident that the ruling is a valid application of the existing Amusement Tax,\" department spokesman John Holden said in an emailed statement. \n \n Emanuel has turned repeatedly to increasing smaller taxes and fees to help fill the city's coffers. \n \n In May he introduced a plan to require off-site parking companies at Chicago's airports to share their revenue with the city in exchange for pickup privileges at O'Hare and Midway airports. \n \n The mayor also has raised fees for parking at downtown garages and cable TV and telephone line 911 service taxes, among others. \n \n jebyrne@tribpub.com \n \n Twitter @_johnbyrne",

According to Fortune, the lawsuit claims streaming customers now face a higher tax rate than if they were watching a DVD, going to the theater, or attending a concert. If the suit succeeds, it could hamper local governments' ability to tax Internet services at a time when increased online commerce is shrinking tax revenues around the country. The lawsuit also alleges the streaming tax is essentially a new one, not an extension of the amusement tax as Chicago's city comptroller claimed.

    "document": "When I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this past weekend, I was shocked to see a painting that depicts a young girl in a sexually suggestive pose. Balthus' painting, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming, is an evocative portrait of a prepubescent girl relaxing on a chair with her legs up and underwear exposed. \n \n It is disturbing that the Met would proudly display such an image. They are a renowned institution and one of the largest, most respected art museums in the United States. The artist of this painting, Balthus, had a noted infatuation with pubescent girls, and it can be strongly argued that this painting romanticizes the sexualization of a child. \n \n In 2013, the Met hosted the exhibit \"Balthus: Cats and Girls\u2014Paintings and Provocations,\" which included more of Balthus' overtly pedophilic work. As the Guardian wrote: \"The Met, not imprudently, has put a plaque at the start of the show that reads: \"Some of the paintings in this exhibition may be disturbing to some visitors.\" If The Met had the wherewithal to reference the disturbing nature of Balthus for this exhibit, they understand the implications of displaying his art as a part of their permanent collection. \n \n Given the current climate around sexual assault and allegations that become more public each day, in showcasing this work for the masses without providing any type of clarification, The Met is, perhaps unintentionally, supporting voyeurism and the objectification of children. \n \n \n \n \n \n I am not asking for this painting to be censored, destroyed or never seen again. I am asking The Met to seriously consider the implications of hanging particular pieces of art on their walls, and to be more conscientious in how they contextualize those pieces to the masses. This can be accomplished by either removing the piece from that particular gallery, or providing more context in the painting's description. For example, a line as brief as, \"some viewers find this piece offensive or disturbing, given Balthus' artistic infatuation with young girls.\" \n \n Ultimately, this is a small ask considering how expansive the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection is (they can easily hang up another painting), how overtly sexual the painting is (the Met's description of the piece provides no background on Balthus or his reputation), and the current news headlines highlighting a macro issue about the safety and wellbeing of women of all ages. \n \n \n \n Please sign this petition if you agree that the Met needs to reconsider the way it is displaying Balthus' suggestive, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming.

Here, Jen George revisits Balthus\u2019s painting Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming. \n \n In Balthus\u2019s painting Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming, a young girl sits, face turned to profile, arms up, elbows out, hands rested on her head, legs a little open, underwear visible\u2014a sort of clothed, daydreaming, preteen odalisque. She is at home in her youth. She has the countenance of someone who knows other things are coming, eventually. Maybe she knows what, though she probably doesn\u2019t. Not like she needs to\u2014experience comes from being alone in the world, and with time. When asked about the provocative poses of preadolescent girls in his work, Balthus said, \u201cIt is how they (young girls) sit.\u201d \n \n When I first saw Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I stopped to sit. Maybe I\u2019d been tired. I had been traveling cross-country with a counterfeit sixty-day Greyhound Ameripass\u2014it allowed for unlimited bus travel within the U.S\u2014and I had been smoking heavily and maybe not sleeping at all. I couldn\u2019t stay all day in the Brooklyn apartment where I\u2019d been sleeping, so most days I went to the Met, looking at art, spacing out, reading, sometimes staring at blank walls. It was inviting, the room and the painting. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s skirt was like mine. My hair was longer. I liked her shoes. I liked that she was both in this room and not; she was dreaming, but I couldn\u2019t see where she\u2019d gone. \n \n I spent my days at the Met mostly trying to forget that I was hungry and without money. I wasn\u2019t dressed properly for late fall in New York. I wrote letters I didn\u2019t send to an older man, an artist back in California. He\u2019d tried to draw me once, late at night, but I couldn\u2019t sit still because I didn\u2019t know how. In the drawing, he\u2019d rendered my face too young, somewhat elfish. He\u2019d titled the drawing The Model Who Kept Moving. \u201cI don\u2019t look like that,\u201d I\u2019d said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you look like,\u201d he told me. \n \n A week into my visit, walking south along Fifth Avenue after the museum had closed, I met an older man who was also walking. He asked me why I walked so fast. \n \n \u201cWhere is your coat?\u201d \n \n He told me about New York, what the best places were, why the city itself was superior. \u201cIt is different and better if you have money. I can show you the other side.\u201d \n \n The letters to the artist in California were brief, hopeful notes, written with a vague intention that if sent, the artist would think of me. Maybe we could see each other in the daytime, I\u2019d written. \n \n \u201cYou should learn how to wear makeup,\u201d the man on Fifth Avenue said as we neared Fifty-Ninth Street. He took me to get my makeup done at Bergdorf Goodman. We didn\u2019t look at coats. At the beauty counters, wealthy women asked for creams, serums, masks, and lipsticks by name. I was made up heavily with blush. \n \n At the rooftop bar at the Peninsula Hotel later, there were heat lamps. I asked for whiskey, but he ordered us martinis. \n \n \u201cYou could be anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hotel owner\u2019s daughter, for instance.\u201d \n \n I was young enough, or feeling the alcohol enough, to believe that I could be anybody, that a way to get through life was to believe that you\u2019re a certain type of anybody whom things belong to, are for. I ate all the free nuts. People looked at us, probably because I was looking at them. Or maybe they were looking at my heavy blush. Maybe I wasn\u2019t supposed to eat the nuts. \n \n Later in the hotel elevator, he put his hand on my neck. \n \n \u201cDo you always go where strange men tell you to go?\u201d \n \n \u201cNo,\u201d I shrugged. \n \n \u201cThey might want to harm you. Maybe I want to harm you.\u201d \n \n \u201cWell, do you?\u201d \n \n \u201cMaybe.\u201d \n \n I told him a friend was waiting for me. He wrote his number in the journal with the letters. \n \n A few days before I left New York, I took a friend to the museum to look at the painting. \n \n \u201cDoes she remind you of anyone?\u201d I asked him. \n \n \u201cNo,\u201d he said. His failure to recognize a similarity between the painting\u2019s subject and myself created a sudden distance between Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and me. I\u2019d spent so much time with her, more than with any one person in the last month, that I had almost considered her the type of close friend that girls have in youth, when they want to look the same and dress the same and think the same, and often do. \n \n I went back to the museum alone the day I was to leave from the Forty-Second Street bus terminal, trying to convince myself that I did look like Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, that we had some quality in common. The gallery was empty. I sat looking at her, studying her face, trying to remember the ways we were the same. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se didn\u2019t reassure me, she didn\u2019t acknowledge anything. She sat still in her pose, eyes closed, face turned away, her profile and underwear catching the light. \n \n I was about six years older than Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is said to be, but Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming would be the image, the place, that stayed with me when I traveled west across frozen highways, on a series of busses, stopping at Greyhound terminals and gas-station food courts, sleeping next to older women and accidentally resting my head against their shoulders as they farted all night and played scratchers and talked to me about their families. I remember they all told me how young I was, asked me what in the hell I was doing. \u201cI wanted to be alone,\u201d I said. \u201cI wanted to be left alone for a little while.\u201d \n \n Jen George lives and works in New York City.

Courtesy The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection, 1998 \u00a9 Balthus \n \n If current trends continue, in just a few years all of contemporary culture will be nothing but an unending stream of cat pictures. Newspapers desperate to survive will publish only adorable kitten photos; social networks will strain under the weight of shorthairs and Siamese. The art world is already getting in on the act: witness the Walker Art Museum in Minneapolis hosting an internet cat video festival (it drew 10,000 viewers in one day), or White Columns, the avant-garde New York gallery, laying on The Cat Show, featuring \"purr-formers in residence\". The Brooklyn Museum recently rehung its august Egyptian collection in a display called \"Divine Felines.\" \n \n I wonder whether the Metropolitan Museum of Art had our contemporary cat mania in mind when it scheduled its smart, strange exhibition of the Polish-French painter Balthus \u2013 a figurative master in an age of abstraction, and one of the creepiest figures of modern art. You may know him as an anti-modernist with a taste for young girls. His love of cats, however, receives less attention, and in this cat-saturated moment that love might become the dominant one. \n \n The first painting, on loan from Switzerland, is a remarkable, full-length self-portrait done at the age of 27. Balthus is wearing high-waisted yellow trousers and an abbreviated necktie, stepping forward seductively with his left foot while an obese tabby nuzzles his right. On the floor, a stone tablet bears an inscription in English: \"A portrait of HM the King of Cats.\" He earned the title. In one almost psychedelic work, from 1949, a grinning feline of human proportions sits at a seaside cafe table; a school of fish jumps from the sea on to the cat's plate, trailing behind it a glorious rainbow. In another artist's hands this might feel tasteless. From Balthus, this is par for the course. \n \n Cat's whiskers \u2026 Detail from Balthus's 1935 self-portrait, The King of Cats (1935). Photograph: Fondation Balthus, Switzerland \u00a9 Balthus \n \n Balthus, born Balthasar Klossowski on 29 February 1908, fell for both art and cats at an early age. At 11, devastated by the disappearance of a stray he'd taken in, the young artist produced 40 memorial ink drawings, each five inches square and done in a forceful black-and-white that recalls the woodcuts of German expressionists like Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. In the first drawing, the preteen Balthus, wearing shorts, finds the cat, Mitsou, on a park bench. Soon they're snuggling together in bed, walking through the streets (Mitsou prances on a leash), sitting by the Christmas tree. In the final scene Mitsou is gone and the boy is left alone in his bedroom, sobbing uncontrollably. \n \n Drawing the line \u2026 the final ink drawing in Balthus's Mitsou series (1919, black ink on paper, 6 x 4 3/4 in). Photograph: Private collection \u00a9 Balthus \n \n The Mitsou drawings made it into print in 1921 with a preface by Rainer Maria Rilke, a friend of the Klossowski family and, by the way, one of the lovers of Balthus's mother. Confident, musical, sweet and grim by turns, these drawings \u2013 the originals are being shown publicly for the first time, and they're the best reason to see the show \u2013 are much more than Balthus juvenilia. They're the pistol shot that began one of the most mystifying, frustrating careers in 20th-century art. \n \n He stood at the core of mid-century European culture, a mate of Picasso and Lacan, but despised much of what we now think of as the greatest achievements of modernism. (His brother Pierre Klossowski, subject of a fantastic show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 2006, was the more progressive figure.) He was a vile anti-semite, despite his own possible Jewish ancestry. Born into something like genteel poverty, he later styled himself as a count and told Alberto Giacometti that he \"needed a ch\u00e2teau more than a workman needed a loaf of bread\". \n \n Recipe for concern \u2026 The Cat of La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e by Balthus (1949). Photograph: Private collection \u00a9 Balthus \n \n And, oh, he also had an inordinate fixation on girls who'd just hit puberty. \"Little girls are the only creatures today who can be little Poussins,\" Balthus said late in life, and this show counterposes images of sly, knowing cats with ones of ostensibly innocent children. The Met, not imprudently, has put a plaque at the start of the show that reads: \"Some of the paintings in this exhibition may be disturbing to some visitors.\" Only some visitors? They should disturb us all. \n \n Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Blanchard, his first muse (if you can use that word for a child), is shown reclining on a divan with her skirt hiked up, panties clinging to her inner thighs, while a cat sups milk from a saucer. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is depicted a second time, in bobby socks, splayed out on a bench and losing her balance. One girl is reading a book on the floor, her bottom hiked in the air; another lounges like an odalisque, gazing into a mirror while her bare leg dangles off a settee. \n \n The girls are self-possessed and serious, and Balthus always denied any hint of paedophilia. But get real: these are erotic images of children. Some, especially the Th\u00e9r\u00e8se portraits, show real invention and even a little humour that make them difficult to dismiss outright. Others, especially the mannered domestic scenes of his later career, are barely competent acts of voyeurism. Their inclusion here displays a welcome willingness on the part of the curator, Balthus specialist Sabine Rewald, to present the artist in full. \n \n More a character study than a real retrospective, this show leaves out many of Balthus's most famous paintings to concentrate on two obsessions that end up rolling into one. Cats may seem anodyne fun to the legions of reblogging obsessives driving today's digital feline explosion. In Balthus's world, though, cats have a much more chilling flipside, and they stay with you long after the latest meme has faded. ||||| New Yorkers launched a petition demanding that the Metropolitan Museum of Art remove a 1938 painting of a young woman with her underwear exposed due to the \u201ccurrent climate around sexual assault\u201d \u2014 but the Met refused Sunday. \n \n The piece, \u201cTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming\u201d by the French artist Balthus, \u201csexualizes\u201d the girl by depicting her lounging in a skirt with her knee up on a chair, according to the petition, which was posted on the website Care 2. \n \n \u201cThe artist of this painting, Balthus, had a noted infatuation with pubescent girls and this painting is undeniably romanticizing the sexualization of a child,\u201d writes Mia Merrill, 30, a New York City entrepreneur who started the petition. \n \n \u201cGiven the current climate around sexual assault \u2026 The Met is romanticizing voyeurism and the objectification of children.\u201d \n \n It proclaims, \u201cThe [Met is] a renowned institution and one of the largest, most respected art museums in the United States. \n \n \u201cI am simply asking The Met to more carefully vet the art on its walls, and understand what this painting insinuates. \n \n \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s a small ask in consideration of how expansive their art collection is \u2026 how overtly sexual the painting is, and the current news headlines highlighting a macro issue about the public health and safety of women.\u201d \n \n The petition, which launched Friday, had raked in nearly 7,000 signatures by Sunday evening. \n \n But a rep for the museum said it won\u2019t remove the painting because art is meant to reflect many time periods \u2014 not just the current one. \n \n \u201c[Our] mission is to collect, study, conserve, and present significant works of art across all times and cultures in order to connect people to creativity, knowledge, and ideas,\u201d said spokesman Kenneth Weine. \n \n \u201cMoments such as this provide an opportunity for conversation, and visual art is one of the most significant means we have for reflecting on both the past and the present.\u201d \n \n In 2013, the Met held an exhibition of Balthus paintings titled, \u201cBalthus: Cats and Girls \u2014 Paintings and Provocations.\u201d \n \n When the erotic realist died in 2001, the lead singer of U2, Bono, sang at his funeral. The president of France and supermodel Elle Macpherson also attended the funeral. ||||| The superb Polish-French painter Balthus\u2014an anti-modernist beloved of modernists, including Picasso\u2014charms the eye and rattles thought. For more than six decades, until his death, in 2001, at the age of ninety-two, Balthus depicted young girls in gamy poses, attributing any perceived eroticism to viewers with unclean minds. His other perennial subject was the cat, his totem animal. A fat feline nuzzles his leg in a self-portrait made when he was twenty-seven; the artist cuts an imperiously Romantic figure and dubs himself, in an inscription in English, \u201cThe King of Cats.\u201d It is the first painting in \u201cCats and Girls,\u201d a focussed retrospective, finely curated by Sabine Rewald, at the Metropolitan Museum. Then come girls, by the dozen, often with cats in attendance. Was Balthus a pedophile? His interest, if not lust, didn\u2019t stir before his subjects\u2019 pubescence, but it waned in their late teens. The show occurs at a cultural moment that is stretched between sexualizing the young and reacting with horror and anger to the lately abundant cases of their sexual exploitation. If you can shrug off that tension at the Met, I salute your detachment. I sure can\u2019t. Balthus puts me in two minds, attracted and repelled, in search of a third. He strains the moral impunity of high art to an elemental limit, assuring himself an august, unquiet immortality. \n \n He was born Balthasar Klossowski in 1908 in Paris. He added \u201cde Rola\u201d to his name, fancifully claiming noble birth; he was given to pretension all his life. He had a remarkably enriched childhood: his father, an art historian, and his mother, a painter who went by the name Baladine, hobnobbed with the literary and artistic \u00e9lites. In his teens, he was mentored by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, a family friend and a lover of Baladine\u2019s, while his older brother, Pierre, became Andr\u00e9 Gide\u2019s secretary. (Pierre went on to be a cult hero of French intellectuals as a devoutly obscene philosopher, novelist, graphic artist, and exegete of the Marquis de Sade.) When Balthasar was eleven, his adored pet cat, Mitsou, ran away. He made forty ink drawings detailing his memories of the animal and his fruitless search for her. In the last, he stands alone, crying. Displayed at the Met, for the first time anywhere, the suite is fantastically talented\u2014the most precocious art I believe I\u2019ve ever seen, with boldly rhythmic compositions like those in German Expressionist woodcuts and uncanny affinities to Matisse. Rilke arranged for the publication, in 1921, of a handsome book of the Mitsou images, for which he wrote the preface. The artist was identified by his nickname, Baltusz. Imagine being thirteen years old and bathed in such glory. A year later, Balthus wrote in a letter, \u201cGod knows how happy I would be if I could remain a child forever.\u201d \n \n Balthus was a largely self-taught artist, who learned what he needed from copying paintings and frescoes in Italy, especially those of Piero della Francesca. Besides the loftily serene Piero, his other major influence was the guttural messiah of realism, Gustave Courbet. That improbable pairing registers throughout Balthus\u2019s work as classical elevation infused with sensual vigor. The style doesn\u2019t feel conservative; it feels outside historical time. You\u2019re always off balance with it, sometimes as if you were being subjected at once to a high-church orison and a dirty joke. Balthus learned to soft-pedal the latter quality after his first gallery show, in Paris, in 1934. Craving attention, he got all too much of it with \u201cThe Guitar Lesson\u201d\u2014a painting not in the Met show\u2014in which a bare-breasted woman holds a schoolgirl, naked from the waist down, across her lap and strums the girl\u2019s genitals. (In one study, the guitarist is male.) Strangely, Balthus was unprepared for the outraged critical response. Meanwhile, Antoinette de Watteville, a girl from a socially prominent Swiss family whom he had desperately wooed for four years, told him that she was engaged to a diplomat and to stop writing her. He attempted suicide with laudanum; his friend Antonin Artaud found him in time. He resumed painting only gradually, with commissioned portraits that bored him. \n \n Then, in 1936, Balthus met Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Blanchard, the eleven-year-old daughter of a restaurant worker. During the next three years, he made ten paintings of her, which are his finest work. They capture moods of adolescent girlhood\u2014dreaming, restless, sulky\u2014as only adolescent girls may authoritatively understand. (I\u2019ve checked with veterans of the condition.) In two of the best, a short-skirted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se raises her leg, exposing tight underpants. We needn\u2019t reflect on the fact that an adult man directed the poses, any more than we must wonder about the empathic author of \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland.\u201d But there it is. Balthus claimed a quality of sacredness for his \u201cangels,\u201d as he termed his models. That comes through. Yet, looking at the paintings, I kept thinking of a line by Oscar Wilde: \u201cA bad man is the sort of man who admires innocence.\u201d It\u2019s an odd relief of uncertainty, if nothing else, to learn that Balthus\u2019s later relationship with his teen-age model Laurence Bataille, a daughter of the writer Georges, was frankly carnal. The painting \u201cThe Week of Four Thursdays\u201d (1949), in which a loosely robed Laurence reclines in abandon and plays with a smiling cat, commemorates days when school was out and she came to pose. She grew up to become a psychoanalyst, like her stepfather, Jacques Lacan. \n \n In 1937, Antoinette de Watteville, having shed her diplomat, gave in and married Balthus. They had two sons. In the one painting of her in the Met show, \u201cGirl in Green and Red\u201d (1944), she looks half her age of thirty-two. Wearing a vaguely harlequin costume, she sits at a table, grasping a candlestick next to a loaf of bread with a knife thrust deep into it. The picture marks one of Balthus\u2019s closest approaches to Surrealism, a movement whose leaders admired and courted him. He rebuffed them, but the equivocal sexuality of his art anchors it in a time, defined by Surrealism, of avant-garde evangelism for an anti-bourgeois, liberated libido. His reticence, in a classicizing style tremulous with carefully observed light, preserves his power to provoke, while the would-be-shocking sallies of, say, Max Ernst have become period curios. Eroticism fades in Balthus\u2019s later work, with simplified figures and rather dull, tortuously worked surfaces of matte pigment, archly evoking Renaissance frescoes. His pretentiousness survived his passion.",

The Metropolitan Museum of Art says it will not take down the 1938 painting \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming\" by the French artist Balthus, though 7,000 people have asked that it do so via the petition site care2. The petition started by Mia Merrill describes the work as \"an evocative portrait of a prepubescent girl relaxing on a chair with her legs up and underwear exposed,\" and calls it \"disturbing\" that the museum would knowingly display such a sexualized image in our \"current climate.\" As for the knowingly part, she notes that the Met paired a 2013 exhibit of Balthus' work with a sign explaining some of the pieces could be \"disturbing\" to viewers. A 2013 Guardian article indicates \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming\" was part of that exhibit. Merrill writes that \"if the Met had the wherewithal to reference the disturbing nature of Balthus, they understand the implications of displaying his art.\" The New York Post reports the museum on Sunday said the painting would remain hanging, with a rep saying, \"Moments such as this provide an opportunity for conversation.\" The museum's description of the piece notes that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Blanchard, Balthus' neighbor in Paris, was 12 or 13 when she was painted. The Paris Review reports the late Balthus was asked about the \"provocative poses\" he painted young girls in, and replied, \"It is how they sit.\" In his review of the 2013 exhibition for the New Yorker, Peter Schjeldahl had this to say: \"I kept thinking of a line by Oscar Wilde: 'A bad man is the sort of man who admires innocence.'\" (A US couple has been forced to give up their $1.75 million painting.)",

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| There's a sexual misconduct elephant in the room on E!'s Oscars Live From the Red Carpet, and his name is Ryan Seacrest. \n \n After Variety recently published a report detailing ex-E! stylist Suzie Hardy's serious harassment and assault allegations against Seacrest, the network doubled down, stating their long-time anchor would still fulfill his duties on Sunday. Awkwardness ensued, as the #MeToo and Time's Up continued to be a central topic of discussion. \n \n The night's major stars responded to E!'s stance with a cold shoulder, simply avoiding interviews with Seacrest. Earlier in the week, actresses like Jennifer Lawrence expressed doubts about interviewing with him. \n \n And indeed, the most talked-about celebrities of the evening were conspicuously absent from his list of interviewees. Out of the twenty people Seacrest interviewed, only two were actual Oscar nominees, with Allison Janney up for supporting actress and Christopher Plummer up for supporting actor. \n \n But the spectre of allegations hung even over those interviews. \n \n Seacrest asked Christopher Plummer about the difficulty of only having nine days to shoot his part in Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World. Though it was on everyone's mind, neither of the men addressed the fact that Plummer was on a time crunch because his scenes were reshoots to replace accused predator Kevin Spacey. \n \n Holy shit Taraji just put a curse on Ryan Seacrest \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/GSknn3NozF \u2014 Sara Jean Hughes (@sarajeanhughes) March 5, 2018 \n \n Empire's Taraji P Henson gave him a very pointed smile and message, saying, \"You know what, the universe has a way of taking care of the good people, you know what I mean?\" Seacrest paused, before replying with a meager, \"I agree.\" \n \n But mostly, E! filled up time with cuts to co-anchor Gulianna Rancic's roundtable discussion, while Seacrest took what he could get. \n \n Certainly, the #MeToo discussions on the Oscars red carpet were much more tame than at previous carpets this awards season. During the Golden Globes red carpet, Debra Messing called out E! during her E! interview about its Catt Sadler pay gap controversy. \n \n Reportedly, this is by design. Hollywood Reporter published an article with unnamed sources claiming that E! was planning to run the red carpet live broadcast on a 30-second delay, in order to avoid those kind of ambushes again. These reports made it extra awkward when Rancic boasted that, \"The unexpected moments happen quickly on this red carpet and you'll see them live only on E!\" ||||| All five women competing in this year\u2019s Oscar race for Best Actress avoided what is typically the \u201cmust do\u201d interview of the red carpet \u2014 a chat with Ryan Seacrest. \n \n Amidst accusations of sexual misconduct against the busy E!

The network denied it, saying no such measures would be taken and the show would be \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d \n \n Less than a week ago, Seacrest\u2019s accuser, former stylist Suzie Hardy, came forward with the specifics of a harassment claim she raised with E! owner NBCUniversal last November \u2014 including accusations that Seacrest groped her genitals and pressed his erection against her. \n \n A formal investigation from the network said Seacrest was innocent of any wrongdoing. His lawyer also said Hardy sought $15 million in exchange for her silence. Hardy hit back and said Seacrest was pushing a \u201cfalse narrative.\u201d ||||| Taraji P.

E! concluded its investigation last month, noting they had found \u201cinsufficient evidence to support the claims against Seacrest.\u201d The \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d host has vehemently denied the claims against him. \n \n \u201cI have no choice but to again deny the claims against me, remind people that I was recused of any wrongdoing, and put the matter to rest,\u201d Seacrest said in a statement. \n \n The show did go on for Seacrest Sunday night, amid speculation he would be snubbed by A-listers on the red carpet.

A number of musicians dropped by to share the mike, including Common and Oscar-nominated songwriters Diane Warren and Mary J. Blige. \n \n Still, E!\u2019s Oscar coverage leaned heavily on co-host Giuliana Rancic\u2019s interviews with celebrities from The Roosevelt Hotel.

Cohen, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, is accused of arranging payments to buy votes for Trump in the 2016 election in exchange for information on his client's business dealings. Cohen was a longtime Trump loyalist who served as his campaign manager and lawyer in the early days of the campaign. The charges against him are expected to be heard in a federal court in New York City. Cohen's lawyers \u2013 \"Holy s---, Taraji just put a curse on Ryan Seacrest,\" tweeted Sara Jean Hughes on Sunday night. Hughes was referring to E!'s Oscars Live From the Red Carpet host, who's been accused of sexual misconduct by a former stylist. Variety reported last week that Suzie Hardy accused Seacrest of sexual harassment and assault, and E! backed him up, saying Seacrest would still host the red carpet show. But on Sunday, E! filled time with cuts to co-anchor Gulianna Rancic's roundtable discussion, while Seacrest took what he could get. \"Certainly, the #MeToo discussions on \u2013 The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements didn't make an appearance on the red carpet at this year's Oscars, which was co-hosted by E!'s Giuliana Rancic and Ryan Seacrest, the Los Angeles Times reports. All five of the women nominated for best actress skipped the E! spot on the carpet, as did Meryl Streep, Margot Robbie, Frances McDormand, Saoirse Ronan, and Sally Hawkins of The Shape of Water. All of them were interviewed by Rancic, while Seacrest was interviewed by Mary J. Blige, Richard Jenkins, Tiffany Haddish, and others. \u2013 Taraji P. Henson appeared to throw more salt in Ryan Seacrest's wounds Sunday night. While chatting with E!'s embattled host about best supporting actress nominee Mary J. Blige, the Hidden Figures actress had a few choice words for Seacrest, 43, who was accused of sexual misconduct by former stylist Suzy Hardy. \"The universe has a way of taking care of takingcare of good people,\" Henson, 47, said, touching his chin. \"Know what I mean?\" Henson immediately doubled down on the Seacrest shade as she moved on to her next interview. \"I'm great now that I'm in \u2013 \"The universe has a way of taking care of good people\u2014do you know what I mean?\" That's what Taraji P. Henson said to Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet before Sunday night's Oscars. It was a reference to the sexual misconduct allegations against the E! host made by his former stylist, Suzie Hardy. In a statement to the New York Post, Seacrest again denied the allegations, which he has repeatedly denied. \"I have no choice but to again deny the claims against me, remind people that I was recused of any wrongdoing, and put the matter to rest,\" he said, adding that",

Ted Cruz's presidential campaign \n \n A draft of the invitation, obtained first by CNN, invites guests to \"honor and support a great friend of Israel and the Jewish people\" \n \n Support for the Texas senator is an about face from the South Carolina senator, who compared nominating Donald Trump or Cruz to being shot or poisoned \n \n (CNN) In a sign of just how much the Republican presidential primary has turned the party on its head, Sen. Lindsey Graham will headline a fundraiser on Monday in support of Ted Cruz. \n \n Graham told CNN that while the Texas senator is not his preferred candidate, he's \"the best alternative to Donald Trump,\" and he said he will \"help Ted in every way I can.\" \n \n A draft of the invitation, obtained first by CNN, invites guests to \"honor and support a great friend of Israel and the Jewish people,\" at a meet-and-greet event that will take place during the AIPAC policy conference in Washington next week. \n \n Graham, who ended his bid for the Republican nomination last December, originally threw his support behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and campaign for him in South Carolina. ||||| Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio told a group of Minnesota supporters Wednesday he is hoping one of the remaining candidates for president will stop Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination \u2014 and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be the best option for conservatives. \n \n Rubio, who dropped out of the race Tuesday after losing his home state of Florida, didn\u2019t endorse any of his former rivals in a conference call with dozens of Minnesota supporters. In the call, he explained his decision to leave the race and why he felt his presidential campaign didn\u2019t do better, and suggested he might run for office again at some point in the future. \n \n He said he saw no real path forward for his campaign after losing Florida and its 99 winner-take-all delegates. He acknowledged he could have stayed in the race with the intention of seeking the nomination at the convention, but said he would have had to run a shoestring campaign with no money to defend himself on the airwaves. Even if he had won the nomination against the odds, Rubio said, the victory could prove pyrrhic. \n \n \u201cWinning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it, even though you did it through the rules of the RNC, would be pretty much fatal for the party,\u201d Rubio said, though he added that many Republicans will not vote for Trump, either. \n \n But he\u2019s rooting for someone else to stop Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination \u2014 someone who can go into the convention with more delegates and a better claim than Rubio believes he would have been able to muster. \n \n He didn\u2019t endorse either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the two other remaining candidates. But Rubio praised Cruz as \u201cthe only conservative left in the race.\u201d \n \n Rubio said his positive campaign message didn\u2019t match the national mood, and said media coverage helped snowball Super Tuesday losses into the end of his campaign. \n \n \u201cThis election was entirely driven by national media coverage, in many ways,\u201d Rubio said, in audio of the conference call obtained by the Pioneer Press. \u201cWhen the media narrative goes negative on you, and all the news is bad, it kind of knocks us off.\u201d \n \n Minnesota was one of only three primaries or caucuses Rubio won in his year-long presidential campaign and the only state he won. His other wins were in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re always joking the last 24 hours at home that we need to move to Minnesota with a winter home in Puerto Rico and work in D.C.,\u201d Rubio said. \n \n The Florida senator said he had tried to run an upbeat campaign, but didn\u2019t think that message resonated in an election when \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of frustration in this country.\u201d \n \n \u201cI really believe we\u2019re on the verge of an incredible era in our history,\u201d Rubio said, but added: \u201cThis is not the greatest year for that kind of message.\u201d \n \n Describing the arc of his campaign for his Minnesota supporters, Rubio said he endured an \u201cunprecedented\u201d amount of attack ads from the Super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Though he \u201cweathered\u201d those ads, Rubio said he \u201cprobably could have won Iowa if it weren\u2019t for the TV attacks.\u201d \n \n He said he \u201csaw the bottom fall out of our support\u201d after the March 1 elections, when Rubio won Minnesota but lost everywhere else. \n \n \u201cThe media kind of just said, \u2018Marco Rubio had a terrible night, and it looks like the strongest anti-Trump alternative is Ted Cruz,'\u201d Rubio said. \n \n He rejected an unidentified supporter\u2019s suggestion that negative coverage by Fox News was particularly to blame for his defeat, but said \u201cthere were a couple people on (Fox) that went full Trump.\u201d \n \n The \u201cdrumbeat\u201d of negative news about his chances made it harder for Rubio to raise money, he said, and also turned away potential voters. \n \n \u201cWhen the media is constantly telling you, \u2018So-and-so is winning and so-and-so is losing,\u2019 it impacts voters,\u201d he said. \n \n Rubio said polling showed him trailing in Florida by just 5 points last Thursday \u2014 \u201cWe were closing fast on Donald Trump in Florida,\u201d he said. But by the time Tuesday came around Rubio got blown out by 17 points. \n \n \u201cThe only thing that happened over the weekend was the constant drip drip drip of \u2018Rubio\u2019s losing\u2019 \u201d in the media, he said \u2014 as well as a Trump rally in Chicago that was canceled after a heavy presence from protesters. \u201cI don\u2019t know for a fact it had an impact on voters, but there\u2019s nothing else that happened during that three-day period.\u201d \n \n But Rubio acknowledged that media narratives cut both ways. \n \n \u201cWhen we won Iowa, we came in third place, but the media coverage treated us like the winner. We were raising $250,000 a day online,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe benefited from that narrative, but in the end, we were hurt by it, too. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d \n \n He said he is \u201cat peace\u201d with his decision to leave the race but believes he might seek office in the future \u2014 though he joked he doesn\u2019t \u201chave any \u2018Rubio 2020\u2019 signs printed out or anything like that.\u201d \n \n \u201cI remain open to public service in the future if the opportunity is right for me,\u201d Rubio said. \n \n Rachel E.

    "document": "Photograph by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images. \n \n For three days last week, Rush Limbaugh ridiculed Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University law student who had argued that health insurers should be required to cover contraception. Then, on Saturday, under pressure from his advertisers, Limbaugh apologized. The apology addressed Limbaugh\u2019s personal language about Fluke, whom he had called a \u201cslut\u201d (and from whom he had jokingly demanded \u201cvideos of all this sex posted online so we can see what we are getting for our money\u201d). But it didn\u2019t recant or rebut any of the ideas Limbaugh put forward during his rants against Fluke. And those ideas are worth examining, because, whether you love or hate Limbaugh, his impromptu monologues are a useful indicator of what many conservative Americans think. Let\u2019s look at the questions he raised. \n \n William Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right. \n \n \n \n 1. What\u2019s the problem with contraceptive insurance: socialism or promiscuity? In his apology, Limbaugh said his objection was to socialism, not sex: \n \n It is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. \u2026 If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n But that doesn\u2019t square with what Limbaugh said during his Flukefest. \u201cI will buy all of the women at Georgetown University as much aspirin to put between their knees as they want,\u201d he joked Thursday. Later that day, Limbaugh repeated: \u201cI'd buy all these women aspirins, put 'em between their knees, like Andrea Mitchell does.\u201d On Friday, he reminded his listeners: \u201cI offered to pay for aspirins.\u201d \n \n Limbaugh was jesting, but the undercurrent seemed real. Does he object to paying for pills, or just for pills that facilitate sex? \n \n 2. How much sex is too much? Fluke said birth control could cost a student more than $3,000 during law school. From this, Limbaugh somehow inferred that \u201cshe and her coed classmates are having sex nearly three times a day for three years straight, apparently.\u201d In truth, Limbaugh has no idea how often Fluke has sex. But I can tell you exactly how many times Limbaugh used the phrase \u201cso much sex\u201d during his three days of attacking Fluke. The number is 23, and it rises above 30 if you include related phrases such as \"sex-crazed coeds,\u201d \u201csex-addict frequency,\u201d \u201chaving sex so often,\u201d \u201chaving sex so damn much,\u201d \u201crepeated, never-ending, as-often-as-she-wants-it sex,\u201d and \u201csex anytime, as many times and as often as they want, with as many partners as they want.\u201d If frequency reflects obsession, Limbaugh is obsessed with sexual frequency. Which raises the question: How much sex, in his view, is too much? \n \n 3. Is contraception a sex enabler? Limbaugh accused Fluke of asking the public \u201cto pay for the things that make it possible for her to have sex.\u201d He called this \u201cthousands of dollars in taxpayer dollars to satisfy the sexual habits of female law students,\u201d and he rejected the idea of subsidizing such \u201cpersonal sexual desires and habits.\u201d Referring to a woman who sought contraception, Limbaugh scoffed, \u201cHere's a woman exercising no self-control. \u201c \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n 4. What consequences should a woman face for having sex? Twice on Thursday, Limbaugh criticized the idea of a \u201cwoman [who] wants unlimited, no-responsibility, no-consequences sex.\u201d On Friday, he faulted people who want \u201csex without consequence\u201d and \u201cbehavior that people want to engage in with no consequences.\u201d What exactly did he mean? Does he think pregnancy is the proper consequence of sex? Does he think it\u2019s wrong to block that consequence? Rick Santorum thinks so. Does Limbaugh agree? \n \n 5. Is pregnancy prevention a legitimate medical need? Twice, Limbaugh mocked the notion that women need birth control to avoid a \u201ckiller disease.\u201d His tone was jocular, but he was essentially repeating an argument made by Catholic bishops: that pregnancy isn\u2019t a disease, and therefore, contraception isn\u2019t health care and shouldn\u2019t be covered by universal health insurance. \u201cThis is a matter of personal choice. It's an elective activity,\u201d Limbaugh protested. \u201cThey want to create a welfare entitlement program where we provide birth control pills, because pregnancy's an illness.\u201d He also compared contraception to Botox, joking that \u201cBotox-filled\u201d House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi had probably told Fluke: \"Have you heard what Botox costs? I can relate!\" Does Limbaugh think contraception is as frivolous as Botox? If not, how seriously does he regard it? \n \n 6. What responsibility should men bear? \u201cWhere are the guys here? Do they not have a role?\u201d Limbaugh asked. \u201cThere are men involved, and that would mean there's some responsibility on the part of the men. Do they not have condoms? \u2026 What about these deadbeat boyfriends? \u2026 Where's their responsibility?\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n These excellent questions were lost in the outrage over Limbaugh\u2019s \u201cslut\u201d remark. Let\u2019s give him credit for raising them, and let\u2019s press him for answers. If he doesn\u2019t want the government paying for birth control, what steps would he take to enforce male responsibility? A DNA database would make babies traceable to their fathers. Would Limbaugh support that? If not, how would he hold deadbeat boyfriends accountable? \n \n You raised good questions, Rush. You\u2019re on the air three hours a day. Let\u2019s hear your answers. \n \n William Saletan's latest short takes on the news, via Twitter: ||||| Rush Limbaugh isn\u2019t the only conservative who bashed Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown University law student who advocated in favor of requiring insurance companies to cover contraception. Actress Patricia Heaton, of Everybody Loves Raymond and The Middle fame, attacked Fluke via Twitter. \n \n And now Heaton\u2019s Twitter account has been deleted. Smells like a PR clean-up to us. Perhaps her bosses at ABC were worried that, as with Limbaugh, the nasty remarks would cause advertisers to flee. Maybe Heaton herself was wary of the backlash. Some of her many tweets about Fluke: \n \n G -Gal: you\u2019ve given yer folks great gift for Mother\u2019s/Father\u2019s Day! Got up in front of whole world & said I\u2019m having tons of sex- pay 4 it! If every Tweaton sent Georgetown Gal one condom, her parents wouldn\u2019t have to cancel basic cable, & she would never reproduce \u2013 sound good? Hey G-Town Gal: Plz let us also pay for your Starbucks, movie theater tickets, and your favorite hot wings combo deal at KFC! Anything else? \n \n More of Heaton\u2019s deleted tweets can be found on Crooks & Liars, Angry Black Girl, and Fanity. ||||| Patricia Heaton is a Coward \n \n Patricia Heaton, star of ABC\u2019s The Middle, high-tailed it off of Twitter recently, presumably because she could not defend the nasty and misogynistic insults that she lobbed at Sandra Fluke. She also encouraged her \u201cTweatons\u201d to lob at Ms. Fluke. \n \n Unfortunately for her, in connection with one of my posts on Oink-Gate, I took a screenshot of her Twitter stream. Here it is: \n \n Sorry, Patricia. You can run away from your words, but you cannot hide from them. The Internet is forever. ||||| Actress Patricia Heaton is perhaps known for her roles in the sitcoms \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and \"The Middle\". She's also an outspoken conservative (not that rare a breed in Hollywood, no matter what Fox News says) who isn't afraid to dip her toe into her frequently factually incorrect political advocacy. For example, she was happy to film a commercial in response to Michael J. Fox's support for a Missouri stem cell research bill by warning against the evils of human cloning and human egg harvesting for profit. \n \n And she's at it again, this time echoing Rush Limbaugh in castigating Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law student who was prevented from testifying in front of Issa's panel discussing the Obama administration's mandate that contraceptive care be offered to all employees free of charge. Heaton tweeted on Wednesday to her 65,000 followers that if each of her \"Tweatons\" (a portmanteau that cannot be scorned enough) would just send the \"Georgetown Gal\" a condom, then \"her parents wouldn't have to cancel basic cable and she wouldn't reproduce\". \n \n The American conservative: Keepin' it Klassy, as always. \n \n Predictably, this set off a firestorm on Twitter, one for which Heaton may not have been prepared. I mean, really, how dare people take offense to her attacking a college student she doesn't know for daring to express concern about her reproductive rights? \n \n Hey Tweatons: progressives are extremely sensitive and delicate. They are also humorless. Treat them gently & don't try to joke w/them. \n \n Yeah, it's our humorless nature that's the problem. It's not that Heaton is armed with no facts, is passing judgments against others and bullying a college student for no other reason than her own ignorant views.",

The number is 23, and it rises above \u2013 Rush Limbaugh is taking a lot of heat for calling law student Sandra Fluke a \"slut,\" but William Saletan at Slate thinks it's time to \"give him credit for raising them, and let's press him for answers.\" Here are six questions he should answer: \"How much sex, in his view, is too much?\" \"Is contraception a sex enabler?\" \"Does he think pregnancy is the proper consequence of sex?\" \"How seriously does he regard it?\" \"If he doesn't want the government paying for birth control, what steps would he take to enforce male responsibility?\" \u2013 Sandra Fluke's high-profile fight with Rush Limbaugh over birth control has resulted in quite a bit of fallout: Patricia Heaton's Twitter account has been deleted, Gawker reports. The Everybody Loves Raymond and The Middle star tweeted a bunch of nasty things about Fluke, including, \"You've given yer folks great gift for Mother's/Father's Day!

    "document": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (left) with Jang Song Thaek, who was the vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, at a cemetery for Korean War veterans in Pyongyang in July. -- PHOTO: ASSOCIATED PRESS \n \n THE execution of Jang Song Thaek, the No. 2 man in North Korea, took Beijing by surprise and will adversely affect bilateral relations. \n \n Beijing's displeasure is expressed through the publication of a detailed account of Jang's brutal execution in Wen Wei Po, its official mouthpiece, in Hong Kong, on Dec 12. \n \n According to the report, unlike previous executions of political prisoners which were carried out by firing squads with machine guns, Jang was stripped naked and thrown into a cage, along with his five closest aides. Then 120 hounds, starved for three days, were allowed to prey on them until they were completely eaten up. This is called \"quan jue\", or execution by dogs. \n \n The report said the entire process lasted for an hour, with Mr Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader in North Korea, supervising it along with 300 senior officials. \n \n The horrifying report vividly depicted the brutality of the young North Korean leader. The fact that it appeared in a Beijing- controlled newspaper showed that China no longer cares about its relations with the Kim regime. \n \n Two days later, the Global Times, associated with the People's Daily, a Chinese Communist Party organ, followed up with a sternly worded editorial saying that the abrupt political change epitomised the backwardness of the North Korean political system. It warned the Chinese government not to coddle North Korea any longer, saying that the majority of Chinese were extremely disgusted with the Kim regime. \n \n The incendiary story, plus the stern editorial, provided a measure of the extent of Beijing's loathing, which is quite understandable. \n \n In purging a top official known for his close ties with Beijing in such a brutal manner, Pyongyang did not hide its antagonism towards China. \n \n The official litany of Jang's treason implicated China three times. Jang was accused of underselling coal and other natural resources for which China was virtually the sole customer. He was also charged with \"selling off the land of Rason economic and trade zone to a foreign country for a period of five decades under the pretext of paying debts\". Finally, he was accused of selling precious metals, thus disrupting the country's financial stability. In fact, China purchased some of North Korea's gold reserves several months ago. \n \n He was also accused of aiding Chinese businessmen in securing low prices for North Korean goods and commodities. \n \n The purge of Jang reflected the longstanding suspicion and apprehension of the North Korean regime towards China, which dates back to the time of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder. \n \n Although China fought the Korean War to preserve the Kim regime, he was less than grateful. Once the war was over, Kim started purging the Yan-an faction within his party. This faction received its training in Yan-an, the capital of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1940s. \n \n Stanford University research fellow David Straub recalled that when he accompanied former United States assistant secretary of state James Kelly to North Korea in 2002, the North's then Vice-Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju made comments that minimised Chinese assistance during the Korean War. \n \n When the son, Kim Jong Il, took over the helm, he did not hide the fact that his nuclear weapons could be used against China. \n \n Dr Xue Litai, a research fellow at Stanford University's Centre for International Security and Cooperation at the time, disclosed that he received further confirmation from an American source who accompanied former US president Bill Clinton in his visit to Pyongyang in 2009. According to the source, a North Korean senior official told Mr Clinton that their nuclear weapons could not reach the US but could be \"pointed West\" in the direction of the Chinese mainland. \n \n The North Korean official also reportedly suggested that if the US changed its policy towards Pyongyang, the latter could become a strong bastion against China. \n \n The Korean peninsula was a vassal state of China in the 17th century. A deep-rooted suspicion remains among the North Korean leadership that China wants to make North Korea its satellite state. Pyongyang also resents Beijing establishing ties with Seoul, which it sees as an act of betrayal. \n \n Nuclear-armed China is seen as having double standards when it exerts pressure on Pyongyang to halt the latter's nuclear programme. \n \n So when the grandson, Mr Kim Jong Un, took over the helm, this family tradition of suspecting China prompted the young leader to take drastic action to cleanse the party of any pro-China elements. \n \n Recent developments have posed a number of issues for China. \n \n First, China's own security is at risk. The erratic and ruthless behaviour of Mr Kim Jong Un suggests that China should not underrate the likelihood of a nuclear threat from Pyongyang. \n \n The Internet version of the Global Times carried an article last Monday by Lieutenant-General Wang Hongguang, former deputy commander of Nanjing Greater Military Region, saying that the recent incident showed North Korea had become increasingly provocative and was getting out of (Chinese) control. He urged a complete reassessment of security threats originating from that direction. \n \n Second, China's political and strategic influence on the Korean peninsula has been drastically reduced. China was widely considered to be able to rein in the unruly Kim regime, thus acting as a force for peace in the region. But it now appears China's influence over its neighbour is close to zero. \n \n This is clear from the fact that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi telephoned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov for urgent consultation on Dec 13. This was followed by Ambassador Wu Dawei's trip to Moscow. Both moves suggest that Beijing realises it can no longer tame the Kim regime by itself. \n \n Third, China had hoped to nurture a less belligerent neighbour by encouraging reform, open- door policies and economic development in North Korea. Jang had been working closely with China to bring about a Chinese-style transformation in his own country. With Jang brutally executed, the idea of a peaceful transformation seems unrealistic. \n \n chingcheong@gmail.com ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Ukraine's daily military briefings typically cover the previous 24 hours. \n \n Lysenko said the rebels had made new gains just east of the border city of Luhansk, one of the rebels' main strongholds, after opening up a new front in another area last week. \n \n \"Direct military aggression by the Russian Federation in the east of Ukraine is continuing. The Russians are continuing to send military equipment and 'mercenaries',\" Ukraine's defense and security council said in a separate Twitter post. \n \n Kiev and Western countries say recent rebel gains were the result of the arrival of armored columns of Russian troops, sent by Russian President Vladimir Putin to prop up a separatist rebellion that would otherwise have been near collapse. \n \n There was no immediate fresh comment from Russia on Saturday. Putin on Friday compared Kiev's drive to regain control of its rebellious eastern cities to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in World War Two. \n \n \"NO TIME TO WASTE\" \n \n EU leaders meeting in Brussels appointed Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk as president of the European Council, giving hawkish Kremlin critics in Eastern Europe new influence in the bloc. \n \n According to a draft statement from the summit, the EU leaders were set to ask the European Commission and the EU's diplomatic service \"to urgently undertake preparatory work\" on further sanctions that could be implemented if necessary. \n \n French President Francois Hollande stressed that a failure by Russia to reverse a flow of weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine would force the bloc to impose new economic measures. \n \n \"Are we going to let the situation worsen, until it leads to war?\" Hollande said at a news conference. \"Because that's the risk today. There is no time to waste.\" \n \n European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the EU was prepared to toughen sanctions against Russia but also that it wanted a political deal to end the confrontation. \n \n \"We are ready to take very strong and clear measures but we are keeping our doors open to a political solution,\" Barroso said at a news conference with Ukraine's president. \n \n Poroshenko said the crisis was close to a tipping point. \n \n \"I think we are very close to the point of no return. The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened on the territory controlled by separatists,\" he said. \n \n He added, however, that a trilateral meeting on Monday involving representatives of Kiev, Moscow and the European Union could produce a ceasefire. \n \n SHOTS FIRED \n \n The crisis started when Ukraine's Moscow-backed president was ousted by street protests in February after he ditched a pact with the EU that would have moved the ex-Soviet republic firmly toward Europe and away from Russia. \n \n Russia denounced the pro-Western leadership that took over as \"a fascist junta\" and went on to annex Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Pro-Russian separatists then rebelled in Ukraine's mainly Russian-speaking east in April, setting up 'people's republics' and declaring they wanted to join Russia. \n \n A senior U.N. human rights official said on Friday nearly 2,600 civilians, Ukrainian government forces and rebels had been killed in a conflict which has led to the biggest Russia-West crisis since the Cold War. \n \n In Kiev, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said a group of pro-Ukrainian fighters had broken out of encirclement by pro-Russian rebels near Donetsk early on Saturday, though other reports suggested many remained trapped. \n \n Defense Minister Valery Heletey also ordered a clamp-down on information coming out of Ilovaysk, a town to the east of Donetsk. \n \n Indicating government forces were being pulled back from the area, Heletey said on his Facebook page: \"As soon as the danger for Ukrainian units has passed, all open information for the current period relating to the withdrawal of forces from Ilovaysk will be published.\" \n \n Last week pro-Russian rebels opened a new front in a separate, coastal territory along the Sea of Azov and pushed Ukrainian troops out of the town of Novoazovsk. They are now threatening the strategic port city of Mariupol. \n \n Several shots were fired on Saturday at a car carrying Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, but he escaped unscathed, another separatist leader, Sergei Kavtaradze, told Reuters. \n \n \"Zakharchenko wasn't hurt. His driver was wounded and is being operated on,\" Kavtaradze said, adding that an operation was under way to catch whoever had fired the shots. \n \n (Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk in Kiev and Anton Zverev in Donetsk; Writing by Richard Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Robin Pomeroy) ||||| BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The European Union on Saturday warned that the apparent incursion of Russian troops on Ukrainian soil pushes the conflict closer to a point of no return, with new economic sanctions being drawn up to make Moscow reconsider its position. \n \n Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, right, talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during an European People's Party summit ahead of the EU summit in Brussels, Saturday, Aug. 30, 2014.

Ten Russian paratroopers were captured this week in Ukraine, adding to a growing body of evidence... (Associated Press) \n \n Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who briefed a summit of the 28-nation EU's leaders in Brussels, said a strong response was needed to the \"military aggression and terror\" facing his country. \n \n \"Thousands of the foreign troops and hundreds of the foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine,\" Poroshenko told reporters in English. \"There is a very high risk not only for peace and stability for Ukraine, but for the whole peace and stability of Europe.\" \n \n French President Francois Hollande and Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said upon their arrival for the summit in Brussels the leaders will make a political decision and then ask the EU's executive arm to finalize the fine print of new sanctions. \n \n However, because several EU nations fear the fallout of sanctions on their own economies, it wasn't immediately clear whether the required unanimity would be reached for immediate punitive measures, or whether the leaders would set Russia another ultimatum. \n \n But Lithuanian leader Dalia Grybauskaite insisted Russia's meddling in Ukraine, which seeks closer ties with the EU, amounts to a direct confrontation that requires stronger sanctions. \n \n \"Russia is practically in the war against Europe,\" she said in English. \n \n NATO estimates that at least 1,000 Russian soldiers are in Ukraine even though Russia denies any military involvement in the fighting that has so far claimed 2,600 lives, according to U.N. figures. \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron also warned that Europe can't be complacent about Russian troops on Ukrainian soil. \n \n \"Countries in Europe shouldn't have to think long before realizing just how unacceptable that is,\" he said. \"We know that from our history. So consequences must follow.\" \n \n Conceding ground in the face of a reinvigorated rebel offensive, Ukraine said Saturday that it was abandoning a city where its forces have been surrounded by rebels for days. Government forces were also pulling back from another it had claimed to have taken control of two weeks earlier. \n \n The statements by Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the national security council, indicate that Ukrainian forces face increasingly strong resistance from Russian-backed separatist rebels just weeks after racking up significant gains and forcing rebels out of much of the territory they had held. \n \n Poroshenko, meanwhile, said Ukraine would welcome an EU decision to help with military equipment and further intelligence-sharing. \n \n The office of the Donetsk mayor reported in a statement that at least two people died in an artillery attack on one of Donetsk's neighborhoods. Shelling was reported elsewhere in the city, but there was no immediate word on casualties. \n \n In Brussels, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said \"sanctions are not an end in themselves,\" but a means to dissuade Russia from further destabilizing Ukraine. \n \n \"We may see a situation where we reach the point of no return,\" Barroso warned. \"If the escalation of the conflict continues, this point of no return can come.\" \n \n He provided no specifics about which sanctions the heads of state and government might adopt to inflict more economic pain to nudge Russia toward a political solution. \n \n The U.S. and the EU have so far imposed sanctions against dozens of Russian officials, several companies and the country's financial industry. Moscow has retaliated by banning food imports. \n \n Grybauskaite said the EU should impose a full arms embargo, including the canceling of already agreed contracts. France has so far staunchly opposed that proposal because it has a $1.6 billion contract to build Mistral helicopter carriers for Russia. \n \n The EU's requirement for a unanimous agreement among the 28 nation has in the past blocked or softened decisions since some nations fear the economic fallout. \n \n Russia is the EU's No. 3 trading partner and one of its biggest oil and gas suppliers. The EU, in turn, is Russia's biggest commercial partner, making any sanctions more biting than similar measures adopted by the U.S. \n \n Barroso said that the EU \u2014 a bloc encompassing 500 million people and stretching from Lisbon to the border with Ukraine \u2014 stands ready to grant Kiev further financial assistance if needed. The bloc will also organize a donors' conference to help rebuild the country's east at the end of the year, he added. \n \n Ukrainian forces had been surrounded by rebels in the town of Ilovaysk, about 20 kilometers (15 miles) east of the largest rebel-held city of Donetsk for days. \n \n \"We are surrendering this city,\" Ukraine's Lysenko told reporters. \"Our task now is to evacuate our military with the least possible losses in order to regroup.\" \n \n Lysenko said that regular units of the military had been ordered to retreat from Novosvitlivka and Khryashchuvate, two towns on the main road between the Russian border and Luhansk, the second-largest rebel-held city. Ukraine had claimed control of Novosvitlivka earlier in August. \n \n Separately, Ukrainian forces said one of their Su-25 fighter jets was shot down Friday over eastern Ukraine by a missile from a Russian missile launcher. The pilot ejected and was uninjured, the military said in a brief statement. \n \n ___ \n \n Jim Heintz reported from Kiev. Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed reporting. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Juergen Baetz on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/jbaetz ||||| The European Union has warned that the apparent incursion of Russian troops on Ukrainian soil pushes the conflict closer to a point of no return, with new economic sanctions being drawn up to make Moscow reconsider its position. \n \n The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, who briefed a summit of the 28-nation EU's leaders in Brussels, said a strong response was needed to the \"military aggression and terror\" facing his country. \n \n \"Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine,\" Poroshenko told reporters in English. \"There is a very high risk not only for peace and stability for Ukraine, but for the whole peace and stability of Europe.\" \n \n However, because several EU nations fear the fallout of sanctions on their own economies, it wasn't immediately clear whether the required unanimity would be reached for immediate punitive measures, or whether the leaders would set Russia another ultimatum. \n \n Lithuanian leader Dalia Grybauskaite insisted Russia's meddling in Ukraine, which seeks closer ties with the EU, amounts to a direct confrontation that requires stronger sanctions. \"Russia is practically at war against Europe,\" she said, also in English. Calling on EU countries to supply Kiev with military equipment, she went on: \"That means we need to help Ukraine to \u2026 defend its territory and its people and to help militarily, especially with the military materials to help Ukraine defend itself because today Ukraine is fighting a war on behalf of all Europe.\" \n \n Nato estimates that at least 1,000 Russian soldiers are in Ukraine even though Russia denies any military involvement in the fighting that has according to the UN claimed 2,600 lives. \n \n David Cameron also warned that Europe cannot be complacent about Russian troops on Ukrainian soil. \"Countries in Europe shouldn't have to think long before realising just how unacceptable that is,\" he said. \"We know that from our history. So consequences must follow.\" \n \n Poroshenko told reporters that he believed efforts to halt the violence were \"very close to a point of no return,\" warning that failure could lead to a \"full-scale war.\" \n \n Conceding ground in the face of a reinvigorated rebel offensive, Ukraine said Saturday that it was abandoning a city where its forces have been surrounded by rebels for days. Government forces were also pulling back from another it had claimed to have taken control of two weeks earlier. The Ukrainian military also reported that one of its fighter jets had been shot down by Russian anti-aircraft fire, although the pilot managed to eject to safety. \n \n The statements by Col Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the national security council, indicate that Ukrainian forces face increasingly strong resistance from Russian-backed separatist rebels just weeks after racking up significant gains and forcing rebels out of much of the territory they had held. \n \n The office of the Donetsk mayor reported in a statement that at least two people died in an artillery attack on one of Donetsk's neighborhoods. Shelling was also reported elsewhere in the city. \n \n Poroshenko said Ukraine would welcome an EU decision to help with military equipment and further intelligence-sharing. \n \n In Brussels, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said \"sanctions are not an end in themselves,\" but a means to dissuade Russia from further destabilising Ukraine. \n \n \"If the escalation of the conflict continues, this point of no return can come.\" \n \n He provided no specifics about which sanctions the heads of state and government might adopt to inflict more economic pain to nudge Russia toward a political solution. \n \n Grybauskaite added that an arms embargo on Russia should be tightened by including a halt on sales under existing contracts \u2013 a thinly-veiled swipe at France, which has resisted calls to cancel a deal to sell Moscow a strategic new warship. This came after the German vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, told journalists: \"It is clear that after this intervention by Russia in Ukraine \u2026 EU leaders will certainly task the European commission with preparing the next level of sanctions.\" \n \n \"We see regular Russian army units operating offensively on the Ukrainian territory against the Ukrainian army. We must call a spade a spade,\" said the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt. \n \n All options except military action will be considered to punish Russia for pursuing \"the wrong path\", said Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign minister. \n \n According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Putin held late-night discussions about Ukraine with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Barroso. \n \n Kiev and Moscow had agreed to hold high-level discussions between army leadership and border control agencies, and an official told AFP that heads of border control will meet on Saturday. \"They will discuss measures to protect Ukrainian territory from breaches by militants and equipment,\" Sergiy Astakhov, an aide to the head of Kiev's border service, said. \n \n UN figures suggest that fighting between Ukrainian military forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine has already claimed at least 2,200 lives. \n \n Nato estimates that there are at least 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine, while Kiev claimed this week that Russian tanks and armoured vehicles entered the country as rebels opened a new front along the Azov Sea coast. Russia consistently denies that its forces are in Ukraine and allegations that it is supplying the rebels. \n \n Until this week, the fighting had been concentrated inland. But rebels have taken control of the town of Novoazovsk, with the apparent aim of pushing further west along the coast connecting Russia to the Crimean peninsula.",

    "document": "A very smart speech by Speaker Boehner \n \n By Ezra Klein \n \n If you spent the afternoon watching C-SPAN, as I did, you heard applause. A lot of it. Over and over again. And when John Boehner took the podium to be sworn in as Speaker of the House of Representatives, it swelled back up, and stayed there. No one Republican member of Congress wants to be the first to stop applauding the new speaker. \n \n Luckily, Boehner did it for them. \u201cIt\u2019s still just me,\" he said with a smile. \n \n Traditionally, politicians overpromise in these moments. If you look back to Nancy Pelosi's speech upon becoming speaker in 2007, or Newt Gingrich's speech upon becoming speaker in 1995, you'll see broad, ambitious, ideologically-charged agendas. Gingrich wanted \"to find a way to truly replace the current welfare state with an opportunity society.\" Pelosi sought \"a new America that declares our energy independence, promotes domestic sources of renewable energy, and combats climate change.\" \n \n Boehner promised almost nothing at all. He certainly didn't set himself up as a foil to President Obama, or anoint himself leader of a new conservative moment in American politics. Rather, his speech had two themes: Humility, and comity. He called his chamber \"the people's house,\" and said \"we are carrying out their instructions.\" He spent a lot of time on the \"scar tissue\" that has built up under \"some of the rituals that have come to characterize this institution under majorities Republican and Democratic alike.\" He promised a new era of openness and minority cooperation in the House. He emphasized his recognition that he held the gavel not because American liked him or his party, but because they were angry at the government and the Democrats who ran it. \n \n It was, I think, as smart a speech as I've seen a politician give -- in part because it was savvy about what it didn't say, which is a rare virtue in Washington. Of course, the speech is the easy part. The rules Boehner is pushing through the House make it vastly easier to increase the deficit through tax cuts, an outcome that won't sit well with Boehner's repeated pledge to hold down the debt. Moreover, Republicans are already having to break their rules to pursue the repeal of health-care reform without paying for it -- a procedural offense in favor of a symbolic vote that, in addition to increasing the deficit, won't exactly usher in a new era of respect and esteem between the two parties. \n \n That's to be expected, perhaps. Many speakers before Boehner have entered the House promising more openness and cooperation and given up on those promises when they began to conflict with more action. And Boehner himself has not always been able to \"disagree without being disagreeable.\" It's when the going gets tough that speakers turn hard. \n \n So we'll see. But thus far, Boehner's political instincts have been quite impressive. The White House may have a more able opponent in him than they thought. \n \n Photo credit: Alex Brandon / AP. ||||| Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) today delivered the following remarks to the opening session of the 112th Congress. A link to the video and the full remarks as prepared are below: \n \n CLICK TO PLAY \n \n \u201cMadam Speaker, thank you for your kind words, and thank you for your service. I\u2019d like to welcome our new colleagues and their families. My own family is here as well: my wife, Debbie, our daughters, Lindsay and Tricia; my brothers and sisters, brothers-and-sisters-in-law, and their children. \n \n \u201cI am honored and humbled to represent a great, hard-working community in Congress. The people of Ohio\u2019s Eighth Congressional District continue to afford me the privilege to serve, for which I am deeply grateful. \n \n \u201cWe gather here today at a time of great challenges. Nearly one in ten of our neighbors are looking for work. Health care costs are still rising for families and small businesses. Our spending has caught up with us, and our debt will soon eclipse the size of our entire economy. Hard work and tough decisions will be required of the 112th Congress. No longer can we fall short. No longer can we kick the can down the road. The people voted to end business as usual, and today we begin carrying out their instructions. \n \n \u201cIn the Catholic faith, we enter into a season of service by having ashes marked on our foreheads. The ashes remind us that life in all its forms is fragile \u2013 our time on this Earth, fleeting. As the ashes are delivered, we hear those humbling words: \u2018Remember you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\u2019 \n \n \u201cThe American people have humbled us. They have refreshed our memories as to just how temporary the privilege to serve is. They have reminded us that everything here is on loan from them. That includes this gavel, which I accept cheerfully and gratefully, knowing I am but its caretaker. After all, this is the people\u2019s House. This is their Congress. It\u2019s about them, not us. What they want is a government that is honest, accountable and responsive to their needs. A government that respects individual liberty, honors our heritage, and bows before the public it serves. \n \n \u201cLet\u2019s start with the rules package the House will consider today. If passed, it will change how this institution operates, with an emphasis on real transparency, greater accountability, and a renewed focus on the Constitution. Our aim will be to give government back to the people. In seeking this goal, we will part with some of the rituals that have come to characterize this institution under majorities Republican and Democratic alike. We will dispense with the conventional wisdom that bigger bills are always better; that fast legislating is good legislating; that allowing additional amendments and open debate makes the legislative process \u2018less efficient\u2019 than our forefathers intended. \n \n \u201cThese misconceptions have been the basis for the rituals of modern Washington. The American people have not been well served by them. Today, mindful of the lessons of the past, we open a new chapter. \n \n \u201cLegislators and the public will have three days to read bills before they come to a vote. Legislation will be more focused, properly scrutinized, and constitutionally sound. Committees, once bloated, will be smaller, with a renewed mission, including oversight. Old rules that have made it easy to increase spending will be replaced by new reforms that make it easier to cut spending. We will start by cutting Congress\u2019 own budget. \n \n \n \n \u201cAbove all else, we will welcome the battle of ideas, encourage it, and engage in it \u2013 openly, honestly, and respectfully. As the chamber closest to the people, the House works best when it is allowed to work its will. I ask all members of this body to join me in recognizing this common truth. \n \n \u201cTo my colleagues in the majority, my message is this: we will honor our Pledge to America, built through a process of listening to the people, and we will stand firm on the Constitutional principles that built our party, and built a nation. We will do these things, however, in a manner that restores and respects the time-honored right of the minority to an honest debate and a fair, open process. \n \n \u201cTo my friends in the minority, I offer a commitment. Openness \u2013 once a tradition of this institution, but increasingly scarce in recent decades, will be the new standard. There were no open rules in the House in the last Congress. In this one, there will be many. With this restored openness, however, will come a restored responsibility. You will not have the right to willfully disrupt the proceedings of the People's House. But you will always have the right to a robust debate in open process that allows you to represent your constituents. . .to make your case, offer alternatives, and be heard. \n \n \u201cIn time, this framework will, I believe, restore the House of Representatives as a place where the people\u2019s will is done. It will also, I hope, help rebuild trust among us and the people we serve, and in so doing, provide a guidepost for those who follow us in the service of our nation. \n \n \u201cTo our new members \u2013 Democratic and Republican \u2013 as you take the oath today, I know you will do so mindful of this shared goal, and the trust placed in you by your constituents. As Speaker, I view part of my job as helping each of you do your job well, regardless of party. My hope is that every new Member \u2013 and indeed, every Member \u2013 will be comfortable approaching me with matters of the House. \n \n \u201cWe will not always get it right. We will not always agree on what is right. A great deal of scar tissue has built up on both sides of the aisle. We cannot ignore that, nor should we. My belief has always been, we can disagree without being disagreeable to each other. That\u2019s why it is critical this institution operate in a manner that permits a free exchange of ideas, and resolves our honest differences through a fair debate and a fair vote. We may have different \u2013 sometimes, very different \u2013 ideas for how to go about achieving the common good, but it is our shared goal. It is why we serve. \n \n \u201cLet us now move forward humble in our demeanor, steady in our principles, and dedicated to proving worthy of the trust and confidence that has been placed in us. If we brace ourselves to do our duty, and to do what we say we are going to do, there is no telling what together we can accomplish for the good of this great and honorable nation. More than a country, America is an idea, and it is our job to pass on to our posterity the blessings bestowed to us. \n \n \u201cI wish you all the very best. Welcome to the people\u2019s House. Welcome to the 112th Congress.\u201d",

If you haven't been keeping up with Garner and Affleck's rollercoaster of a relationship post-split, allow us to get you up to speed. \n \n The couple made headlines worldwide after announcing that they would be going their separate ways after 10 years of marriage. Just days after the pair marked their ten year wedding anniversary, the couple released a short statement about their separation back in 2015: \"After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.\" RELATED VIDEO: JENNIFER GARGER ON HER RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN AFFLECK: \"WE MAKE IT WORK\" \n \n Since first announcing their separation, the couple have maintained an amicable relationship, successfully co-parenting their three children\u2014Violet (aged 12), Seraphina (aged nine) and Samuel (aged six). The pair seem so friendly, in fact, that many people have taken their delay in divorcing, paired with their cheerful demeanour in public and several family holidays, to mean that there may be a chance that the two will reunite once again. But considering Affleck's many highly publicised relationships\u2014notably with SNL producer, Lindsey Shookus, and most recently with model Shauna Sexton\u2014and Garner's solo public appearance, we suspect that a rekindling may not be on the cards. So what could possibly be holding up their final and legal split? \n \n After reportedly trying to work on their relationship after announcing their separation, with Affleck even attempting to win his ex-wife back, Garner ultimately filed for divorce in April 2017. But rather than progress with legal proceedings, the actress seems to have put a hold on the whole thing. The divorce has taken so long to finalise that the judge handling their case is even threatening to dismiss it. According to The Blast, the court is quickly losing patience, telling the couple \"If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution.\" RELATED VIDEO: JENNIFER GARNER AND BEN AFFLECK'S DAUGHTER VIOLET IS SO GROWN UP \n \n It seems the one thing holding Garner back from signing off on the divorce is one single frustration she still has with her ex-husband\u2014his sobriety. A source close to the actress voiced her concerns, explaining that his current state makes her uneasy about progressing with their divorce. \"Jen is on good terms with Ben for the most part, [but] they still have their frustrations,\" they told Us Weekly. \"It's a working progress and they're still taking it one day at a time.\" The source went on to say: \"The one thing she's not flexible on is sobriety. Jen is hesitant to sign off until she's certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.\" \n \n Affleck has since been spotted arriving at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. \"This is part of his practice and how he maintains his personal health,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"He's been doing these classes for months. He's also been spotted outside of meditation classes as well as meetings. He's focused on being there for those in his life.\" Progress aside, the couple are now aware that they may need to re-file for divorce considering Garner's still-existing hesitation when it comes to Affleck's suitability as their childrens' guardian. ||||| Ben Affleck Seeks Help and Back in Rehab After Intervention by Jen Garner \n \n Ben Affleck Seeks Help and Back in Rehab After Intervention by Jen Garner \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n 8/23 -- The photo above is Affleck at Jack in the Box, where he stopped before arriving at the rehab center. \n \n 8/22 7:20 PM PT -- We've learned Ben has arrived at a live-in rehab facility and will check in for an extended period of time. \n \n Jennifer Garner has staged an intervention to help Ben Affleck, and TMZ has learned Ben wanted the help and agreed to go to rehab. \n \n Jennifer went to Ben's Pacific Palisades home Wednesday afternoon to sit down with her estranged husband, begging him to get help.

    "document": "As of Tuesday morning, the South Korean authorities had confirmed at least 95 MERS cases and were monitoring more than 2,500 people under quarantine for symptoms. At least seven patients have died. \n \n So many patients, including those in rural towns, seek medical care at large hospitals that securing a bed in a mega-hospital in Seoul, the capital, for a relative or friend has become a test of a person\u2019s networking ability. Patients often visit small hospitals to get a referral to a bigger hospital. \n \n The two hospitals where the vast majority of MERS cases have occurred were among the biggest in their cities. \n \n \u201cMany people want to check into famous hospitals, some even waiting in their emergency rooms until a bed gets available,\u201d said Kim Woo-joo, head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, who is leading the government\u2019s epidemiological study of the MERS outbreak. \u201cIn big hospitals, we see bottlenecks. This is a very Korean thing, and I think this is not a good situation when we have a new contagious virus breaking out.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n In many ways South Korea is one of the world\u2019s most technologically advanced countries, where most of the population is connected to the Internet and nearly everyone has a smartphone. But within a matter of days, it has also become known for the largest caseload of MERS outside of Saudi Arabia, where the disease first emerged in 2012. \n \n Researchers have traced MERS to a virus that is believed to have jumped from camels to humans. The virus can be spread by breathing the same air as an infected and coughing person in proximity. It causes high fevers and pneumonia-like symptoms, and there is no cure. \n \n The hospital odyssey of the first infected patient, known as the index case, began after May 11, when he developed a fever and began coughing. He visited a clinic in his hometown Asan, south of Seoul, on May 12, 14 and 15. Perplexed doctors, not knowing he had even visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in early May, sent him to a bigger hospital, St. Mary\u2019s, in Pyeongtaek, 37 miles south of Seoul. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n With no improvement, he went to Seoul to seek better medical care, visiting a relatively small hospital there on May 17, when X-rays suggested pneumonia. The next day he was referred to the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, one of the largest in South Korea, where doctors suspected he had MERS, learned of his Middle East visit and isolated him. The correct diagnosis was confirmed on May 20. \n \n Mr. Kim said the crowded conditions at St. Mary\u2019s had been ideal for the virus to spread. So far, 37 St. Mary\u2019s patients have been confirmed as having caught the virus \u2014 nearly 40 percent of the known total. \n \n \u201cIt must have been a period when the virus was most active in him and he was coughing out a lot of virus droplets,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \n \n One of the St. Mary\u2019s patients infected by the index case later checked into the emergency ward of the Samsung hospital in Seoul, infecting at least 35 people there. Nearly 700 people who were at the emergency ward have been quarantined. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But fears of the virus have led to the closings of nearly 2,000 kindergartens and schools and the cancellation of concerts and religious and social gatherings. Sales of face masks and hand sanitizer have soared. Baseball stadium attendance has plummeted. \n \n In a sign of widening fear in Asia, the authorities in Hong Kong raised their three-stage response level on Monday from \u201calert\u201d to \u201cserious,\u201d which means ports of entry will exert tighter arrival controls. The Hong Kong Center for Health Protection posted an advisory about the raised response on its website, urging people to \u201cavoid unnecessary travel\u201d to South Korea. \n \n The W.H.O. appeared to be less concerned, saying that it was not advising special actions at ports and airports in South Korea or travel or trade restrictions, \u201cgiven the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community.\u201d \n \n Video \n \n Alison Clements-Hunt, a spokeswoman for the health organization, said that the virus pattern found in South Korea was in line with those monitored elsewhere. The testing on a virus sample in South Korea \u201cshows nothing alarming in terms of mutations and change in what would be the transmissibility of the virus.\u201d \n \n Nonetheless, she said the organization was sending a team of experts to South Korea. She also said frequent visits to patients at hospitals in some Asian cultures were \u201csomething that may need to be looked at in the light of MERS.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Some experts have faulted the South Korean government for the way it initially handled information on the outbreak. None of the hospitals where patients were infected had been alerted about the possibility of MERS. \n \n \u201cDoctors were diagnosing the patients without knowing anything about MERS,\u201d said Jee Sun-ha, a professor of public health at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cOnce the authorities detected the first case, they should have taken more aggressive steps, revealing the names of the hospitals the patients had visited and trying as much as possible to localize the outbreak.\u201d \n \n It was only Sunday that the government revealed the names of all 24 hospitals the confirmed cases had visited \u2014 two and a half weeks after the first case was discovered. They have since added five more to the list. \n \n The government said it had been reluctant to make the names public, fearing possible panic in the neighborhoods around the hospitals. After their names were released, some of the hospitals reported a plunge in the number of outpatients and even closed down temporarily. \n \n But Choi Chang-woo, head of the civic group Citizens\u2019 Solidarity for Safe Society, said that the government\u2019s \u201cmonopoly on information,\u201d which he said was rooted in South Korea\u2019s authoritarian past, was partly to protect the business interests of big hospitals and keep people ignorant about mistakes. \n \n \u201cThey haven\u2019t learned from the Sewol disaster,\u201d Mr. Choi said, referring to the hundreds of deaths in the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April last year, often attributed to the government\u2019s fumbled rescue. \u201cThis is what you get when your government\u2019s top priority is not the safety of the people.\u201d \n \n President Park Geun-hye\u2019s weekly approval rating dropped six percentage points to 34 percent last week in the aftermath of the MERS outbreak, according to a survey released on Friday by Gallup Korea. On Monday, Ms. Park vowed an \u201call-out national response.\u201d \n \n Efforts included exploiting South Korea\u2019s advanced cellphone network, tracing the signals of people who had defied quarantine in order to find them. \n \n \u201cNow the government is belatedly trying to mend the fence after the cow had already been stolen,\u201d Mr. Choi said. ||||| SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea believes its MERS virus outbreak may have peaked, and experts say the next several days will be critical to determining whether the government's belated efforts have successfully stymied a disease that has killed seven people and infected nearly 100 in the country. \n \n Visitors wear mask as a precaution against the MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, virus as they arrive at Incheon International Airport in Incheon.

(Associated Press) \n \n The biggest outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outside the region where it was first seen in 2012 was introduced to South Korea last month by a 68-year-old man who had traveled to Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries. \n \n When he got sick after his return to South Korea, he visited several hospitals and clinics, where dozens of other patients and hospital workers were infected before officials found he had MERS. Gradually, the government began isolating victims and quarantining those who'd had contact with them. \n \n There has been widespread fear here of the poorly understood disease, which has no vaccine and as much as a 40 percent mortality rate. There also had been growing criticism over failures by health workers and the government to initially recognize and quickly contain the disease. \n \n Nearly 3,000 people have been placed in isolation and 2,200 schools closed in South Korea. Although MERS spreads through close contact with sick people, not through the air, many people here have avoided going to crowded places like baseball parks and movie theaters. Travel agencies report a sharp increase in the number of foreigners canceling plans to visit South Korea. \n \n The outbreak, however, has so far been contained in hospitals and there's no evidence, the U.N. health agency says, of \"sustained transmission in the community.\" \n \n Authorities say the first MERS patient didn't reveal his Saudi Arabia trip to doctors until he arrived at the Seoul-based Samsung Medical Center after being treated at three other hospitals, including St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul. Samsung and St. Mary's have seen most of the country's infections. \n \n The initial patient's wife, who was the country's second MERS case and is now out of the hospital, recently told a local TV station that her husband didn't intend to hide information about his travels, but simply had trouble talking to doctors because of his high fever. \n \n Because the virus' incubation period is estimated at five to six days on average, extending up to about two weeks, experts believe there won't be any more cases directly infected by the first patient. The Health Ministry said that no more MERS cases have originated from St. Mary's Hospital. \n \n There are still concerns about Samsung Medical Center, where at least 37 people have been infected, although fewer cases have been reported there in recent days. \n \n The initial patient was eventually isolated on May 20 after doctors at Samsung, where the man ended up, suspected he had MERS and alerted the government, which moved him to a government-run facility. But a week later, another so-called \"super-spreader\" \u2014 a man who'd been infected by the initial patient at St. Mary's Hospital \u2014 checked into an overcrowded Samsung Medical Center, where he was forced to stay for several days in the emergency room. He spread the disease among doctors, visitors and other patients there, according to health officials. \n \n The maximum incubation period for those infected by the second \"super-spreader\" ends around this Friday, experts said, which raises hopes that the outbreak could weaken soon. \n \n \"I cautiously predict (MERS) will peak today\" and be stabilized in the next few days, Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo told lawmakers Monday. \n \n The prospects for the virus weakening this week depend on whether there are many people who have evaded government quarantine measures and infected other people in various places, said Jacob Lee, an infectious disease expert at Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital in Seoul. \n \n World Health Organization experts arrived in South Korea on Monday to investigate the outbreak. \n \n There are concerns that South Korea's economy could suffer as tourism and business travel drop because of MERS fears. \n \n Hong Kong has issued a red travel warning for South Korea, the second highest of three levels, and advised residents against unnecessary travel there. Hong Kong has been hypersensitive to infectious diseases since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, which killed hundreds of people. \n \n MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Kelvin K. Chan in Hong Kong contributed to this report. ||||| 2015/06/09 11:38 \n \n SEJONG, June 9 (Yonhap) -- South Korea confirmed another death from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and reported eight new cases Tuesday, raising the number of infections to 95. \n \n The latest fatality, the seventh since the country first reported the outbreak on May 20, was a 68-year-old woman who had already been suffering from chronic heart conditions, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. \n \n She was hospitalized at Seoul's Samsung Medical Center on May 27-28, during which she came in close contact with a MERS patient. \n \n The total number of people diagnosed with the disease came to 95 as the country confirmed eight new cases. \n \n All eight new patients were infected after coming in close contact with those previously diagnosed at five hospitals, including Asan Medical Center, one of the largest hospitals in the capital. \n \n As of Tuesday morning, 2,892 people, including family members of those diagnosed, were in isolation for possible infection from coming into close contact with a MERS patient, according to the ministry. \n \n The health ministry said it will fully fund the cost of diagnosis and treatment for those who have contracted the disease, as well as those in quarantine as suspected cases. \n \n The ministry again warned against groundless fears, noting nearly two-thirds of those diagnosed with the disease had existing health conditions while all of those who have died from the disease had existing illnesses or other health problems. \n \n Two people diagnosed with the disease have been released after making complete recoveries. \n \n The number will soon reach three as another patient was set to be discharged from the hospital later in the day, the ministry said. \n \n So far, all infections have occurred at hospitals where at least one MERS patient had visited or stayed for treatment -- the reason the government believes the disease can still be contained. \n \n Keiji Fukuda (L), an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization who is leading a delegation of medical experts to South Korea, speaks during the first meeting of a joint response team with South Korean officials at the government complex in Sejong, South Korea on June 9, 2015. (Yonhap) \n \n To help prevent the disease from spreading further, the government has released the names of all hospitals affected by the disease, which stood at 29 as of late Monday. \n \n Government officials said the number of new infections, along with the number of patients, may begin to dwindle this week. \n \n \"The government has decided to switch to an all-out response system as if it was seeking to eliminate the disease this very week,\" acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said in a meeting with officials over the outbreak, adding he will daily attend the emergency meetings until the disease is eliminated. \n \n \"This week may be very crucial to overcoming MERS. The government will mobilize all available resources and necessary budget to help eradicate the disease at the earliest date possible,\" said Choi, who is also the country's finance minister. \n \n MERS is a viral respiratory illness that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The disease had a very high fatality rate of over 40 percent before the outbreak in South Korea, according to the health ministry. Currently, the disease has a fatality rate of around 8 percent here. \n \n Still, health officials here are struggling to find out the reasons for what they have called the unusually fast and wide spreading of the disease, which had only some 1,100 confirmed cases throughout the world before the outbreak here. \n \n With 95 confirmed cases, South Korea now has the second-largest number of people diagnosed with the disease after Saudi Arabia, which has reported over 1,000 cases since it reported the world's first case in 2012. \n \n A team of medical experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) was here to help explain the reason. \n \n The experts were set to form a joint response team with officials here to find any factors driving the outbreak, according to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. \n \n In a recent interview with Yonhap, Chan noted the country's traditional culture of family members caring for their loved ones in hospitals or at home may have contributed to the fast spread of MERS here. \n \n bdk@yna.co.kr \n \n (END) ||||| The outbreak of Middle East Respiratory System in South Korea, which began last month, continues to spread.

Still, he was referred once more to one of the country's largest hospitals, the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul. There, doctors learned he hadn't just visited Bahrain on a recent trip as he had previously disclosed, but also the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reports. (The patient's wife says he had trouble communicating with a high fever.) A test confirmed on May 20 he had the highly contagious MERS virus.

Almost 3,000 are under quarantine, including 700 who were in the crowded Samsung Medical Center ER when the carrier arrived, while 2,200 schools have been closed, the AP reports.

There are also some general exceptions to the 48-hour week including for those workers whose working time is not measured and are in control of their work. \n \n World news in pictures \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 50 show all World news in pictures \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1/50 16 March 2018 Russian President Vladimir Putin visits the Almazov National Medical Research Centre in Saint Petersburg.

She was 88. \n \n Her death was first reported by the German newspaper Bild, which also confirmed that Mrs. Burwitz had worked for two years in West Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence agency. The agency\u2019s chief historian, Bodo Hechelhammer, told the newspaper that Mrs. Burwitz worked as a secretary under an assumed name in the early 1960s. The agency does not comment on current or past employees until they have died. \n \n Mrs. Burwitz, who was sometimes called a \u201cNazi princess\u201d by supporters and detractors alike, remained unrepentant and loyal to her father to the end. Although she had visited a concentration camp, she denied the existence of the Holocaust and, in later years, helped provide money and comfort to former Nazis convicted or suspected of war crimes. \n \n At the time of her birth in 1929, her father was consolidating power as leader of the elite Nazi paramilitary corps known as the SS. Himmler also commanded the German secret police, the Gestapo, and established the Nazi network of prison and death camps throughout Europe. Millions of people \u2014 primarily Jews but also Roma (or Gypsies), homosexuals, disabled people and others \u2014 would perish in the Holocaust. \n \n The only person who outranked Himmler in the Nazi hierarchy was Hitler himself. \n \n Gudrun, who was Himmler\u2019s oldest child and only legitimate daughter, was exceptionally devoted to her father. Himmler and his wife later adopted a son, and Himmer had two other children with his mistress. \n \n Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, the bespectacled, undistinguished-looking Himmler enjoyed having Gudrun at his side, as a blond, blue-eyed symbol of Aryan youth. In a diary later seized by Allied authorities, she noted that she liked to see her reflection in her father\u2019s polished boots. She attended Christmas parties with Hitler, who gave her dolls and chocolates. \n \n When she was 12, Gudrun accompanied her father to the Dachau concentration camp, which was the site of Nazi medical experiments and the execution of tens of thousands of people. \n \n Gudrun recalled the visit in her diary: \u201cToday we went to the SS concentration camp at Dachau. We saw everything we could. We saw the gardening work. We saw the pear trees. We saw all the pictures painted by the prisoners. Marvelous. \n \n \u201cAnd afterward we had a lot to eat. It was very nice.\u201d \n \n As the Third Reich was collapsing in May 1945, 15-year-old Gudrun and her mother fled to northern Italy, where they were arrested by American troops. Himmler was captured, and, while in British custody, killed himself on May 23, 1945, by biting on a cyanide capsule he had concealed. \n \n 1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2018: George H.W.

She refused to believe that her father\u2019s death was a suicide and maintained that he had been killed by his British captors. \n \n She was present at some of the war-crimes trials of her father\u2019s associates in Nuremberg, Germany. \n \n \u201cShe did not weep, but went on hunger strikes,\u201d Norbert and Stephan Lebert wrote in \u201cMy Father\u2019s Keeper,\u201d their 2002 book about the children of Nazi leaders. \u201cShe lost weight, fell sick, and stopped developing.\u201d \n \n After their release, mother and daughter settled in the northern German town of Bielefeld, where Gudrun trained as a dressmaker and bookbinder. She found it hard to hold a steady job with her family history. \n \n In 1961, she joined the German intelligence service as a secretary under an assumed name at the agency\u2019s headquarters near Munich. She was dismissed in 1963, when West German authorities were reviewing the presence of former Nazis in the government. \n \n In the late 1960s, she married Wulf-Dieter Burwitz, a writer who became an official in a right-wing political group, and settled in a Munich suburb. They had two children. \n \n Gudrun Margarete Elfriede Emma Anna Himmler was born Aug. 8, 1929, in Munich. Except for a brief interview in 1959, she is not known to have spoken in public about her father or her later life. \n \n She did, however, often wear a silver brooch given to her by her father, depicting the heads of four horses arranged in the shape of a swastika. \n \n She was also known to be active in a group called \u201cStille Hilfe,\u201d or silent help, which was formed in the 1940s to help Nazi fugitives flee Germany, particularly to South America, and to support their families. \n \n The organization is \u201cclosely linked to a number of outlawed neo-Nazi movements and actively promotes revisionism \u2014 the notion that the Holocaust never happened and Jews caused their own downfall,\u201d Andrea Roepke, a German authority on neo-Nazis, told Britain\u2019s Daily Mail newspaper in 1998. \n \n Among followers of the group, Mrs. Burwitz was \u201ca dazzling Nazi princess, a deity among these believers in the old times,\u201d according to German author Oliver Schrom, who wrote a book about Stille Hilfe. \n \n Mrs. Burwitz attended underground reunions of Nazi SS officers, often held in Austria, possibly as recently as 2014. \n \n \u201cShe was surrounded all the time by dozens of high-ranking former SS men,\u201d Roepke said, after attending one such gathering. \u201cThey were hanging on her every word . . . It was all rather menacing.\u201d \n \n Mrs. Burwitz also provided support, through Stille Hilfe, to convicted Nazi war criminals, including Klaus Barbie, an SS officer dubbed the \u201cButcher of Lyon,\u201d and Anton \u201cBeautiful Tony\u201d Malloth, who was convicted of killing prisoners at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. \n \n Malloth was sentenced to death in absentia by a court in the Czech Republic, but Mrs. Burwitz reportedly helped arrange for him to stay at a retirement facility outside Munich on land once owned by Nazi official Rudolf Hess. \n \n \u201cI never talk about my work,\u201d she said in 2015 when British journalist Allan Hall confronted her at her home. \u201cI just do what I can when I can.\u201d \n \n \u201cGo away,\u201d her husband said. \u201cYou are not welcome.\u201d \n \n An earlier version of this story stated that Heinrich Himmler was captured by Russian forces on May 20, 1945. Historical accounts differ on how and when he was captured. The story also incorrectly implied that all victims of the Holocaust died in concentration camps.",

She worked there while the agency was run by a former Nazi military intelligence commander. The BND still exists as the unified Germany's foreign intelligence agency, and Deutsche Welle notes that its use of former Nazis in Eastern Europe after the war remains controversial.

Gudrun Burwitz, who died last month at 88, was the daughter of Heinrich Himmler, who commanded the SS and is considered the chief architect of the Holocaust. He killed himself in custody in 1945. Burwitz never disavowed Nazism and defended her father's reputation, the BBC reports. She was a teenager when the war ended and was released in 1946 after testifying at the Nuremberg trials. German Tabloid Bild reported on her post-war involvement with the BND on Friday, following her death in Munich last month. The head of the spy agency's history department then corroborated the newspaper report about Burwitz's activities in West Germany, which reunited with communist East Germany in 1990 to form the present German state.

    "document": "(CNN) The sounds recorded on one of the \"black boxes\" recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 firms up investigators' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. \n \n \"For God's sake, open the door!\" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. \n \n Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. \n \n The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. \n \n France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency is \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak to Bild. \n \n Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere \"voyeurism.\" \n \n According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Andreas Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz tells him he can go anytime. \n \n Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot of Flight 9525 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains, French authorities have said. \n \n The flight took off 20 minutes late. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. \n \n Once that's finished, Lubitz again tells the captain he \"can go anytime.\" \n \n There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, \"You can take over.\" \n \n At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. \n \n Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the \"sink rate,\" Bild reported. \n \n Next comes the banging. \n \n Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. \n \n Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). \n \n A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says \"Terrain -- pull up!\" \n \n \"Open the damn door!\" the pilot says. \n \n It's 10:38, and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. \n \n Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. \n \n Screams can be heard one final time. \n \n 'Unbelievable' leak \n \n Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. \n \n Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. \n \n Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. \n \n An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. \n \n Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. \n \n What authorities know \n \n Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, said on Saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point. \n \n But French authorities have said that Lubitz appeared to have crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately into the Alps on Tuesday as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, toward Dusseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board. \n \n Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind since then, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. \n \n Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. \n \n An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. \n \n JUST WATCHED Police search Germanwings co-pilot's home for clues Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police search Germanwings co-pilot's home for clues 00:10 \n \n The official also said that the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. \n \n A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. \n \n The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. \n \n The note, which was \"slashed,\" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. \n \n The fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. \n \n Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. \n \n Anxiety, burnout and depression \n \n A handful of publications, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies. \n \n CNN has not been able to confirm these reports. \n \n Lubitz suffered from \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reported Sunday, citing sources close to the investigation. In 2010, Lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication, the paper said. \n \n He was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters, but it's unclear when that happened, according to Le Parisien. \n \n The newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes, which forbade him from working from March 16 to March 29. \n \n The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. \n \n A subsequent report from the Times on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. However, an official with Lufthansa, said that if Lubitz had vision problems, they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination. \n \n Authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic, according to the Times. \n \n Citing an unidentified senior investigator, German newspaper Die Welt said that Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and that German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told the newspaper. \n \n News reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. \n \n Investigators are expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside. \n \n Lubitz had a girlfriend, a teacher at a school in Dusseldorf not far from his apartment, according to German media. \n \n 'This is a man whose life is totally broken' \n \n Dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony Saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains, France. Most of the people on the plane were from Germany and Spain. \n \n Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. \n \n The mayor of one local community said he had seen Lubitz's father on Thursday evening, describing him as \"a man in deep distress.\" \n \n \"We get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders,\" Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said Saturday. \n \n \"I can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken,\" Bartolini said. \"He had so much emotion in him.\" ||||| MONTABAUR, Germany (AP) \u2014 The pastor of the Lutheran church in Andreas Lubitz's hometown said Sunday that the community stands by him and his family, despite the fact that prosecutors blame the 27-year-old co-pilot for causing the plane crash that killed 150 people in southern France. \n \n Buses of the French gendarmerie, park and mask the homage ceremony with family members of Japanese victims in the area where the Germanwings jetliner crashed in the French Alps, in Le Vernet, France,...

(Associated Press) \n \n In this still image photo taken from video, Priest Michael Dietrich, from the hometown of co-pilot Andeas Lubitz talks during an interview with AP Television, in Montabaur, Germany, Sunday, March 29,... (Associated Press) \n \n The town of Montabaur has been rattled by the revelation that Lubitz, who first learned to fly at a nearby glider club, may have intentionally caused Tuesday's crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. \n \n \"For us, it makes it particularly difficult that the only victim from Montabaur is suspected to have caused this tragedy, this crash \u2014 although this has not been finally confirmed, but a lot is indicating that \u2014 and we have to face this,\" pastor Michael Dietrich said. \n \n He spoke to The Associated Press after holding a church service Sunday to commemorate the crash victims and support their families. \n \n \"The co-pilot, the family belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this, and want to support the family in particular,\" Dietrich said. \n \n He added that there is no direct contact with the family at the moment, but that he believes they are receiving good assistance. \n \n French prosecutors haven't questioned the family yet \"out of decency and respect for their pain,\" Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said. \n \n Authorities are trying to understand what made Lubitz lock his fellow pilot out of the cockpit and ignore his pleas to open the door before slamming the plane into a mountain on what should have been a routine flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. \n \n French officials refused to confirm or deny a partial transcript that German newspaper Bild am Sontag said it had obtained of the cockpit recording. The paper reported Sunday that the pilot left for the toilet shortly before 10:30 a.m. and was heard trying unsuccessfully to get into the cockpit again a few minutes later, then shouting \"for God's sake open the door.\" \n \n After several more minutes in which the pilot could be heard trying to break open the door, the plane crashed into the mountainside, according to Bild am Sonntag, which didn't say how it obtained the report. \n \n Brice, the Marseille prosecutor said that none of the bodies recovered so far have been identified, denying German media reports that Lubitz's body had been found. \n \n Tests on the body of the co-pilot may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving. Germany prosecutors said Friday that Lubitz was hiding an illness and sick notes for the day of the crash from his employer. \n \n Dietrich, the pastor, said he knew Lubitz as a teenager, when he attended religious education 13 years ago, and his mother, who worked as a part-time organist in the community. \n \n \"When I worked with her or talked to her, it was very good and very harmonious.

which led to the allegations that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane - were a \"serious breach of fundamental and globally accepted international accident investigation rules.\" \n \n tj/sms (dpa, Reuters, AFP, epd, dpa) ||||| Rescuers still to find plane\u2019s flight data recorder, leading to growing calls for caution in blaming co-pilot Andreas Lubitz for deliberately downing the aircraft \n \n Forensic teams have identified 78 distinct DNA strands from body parts spread across the remote mountainside in the French Alps where Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed, killing all 150 people on board. \n \n Rescuers are still, however, to locate the plane\u2019s second black box \u2014 its flight data recorder \u2014 six days after the Barcelona to D\u00fcsseldorf flight crashed into a rocky ravine at 435 miles (700km) per hour. \n \n Between 400 and 600 body parts have been located and are currently being examined. \n \n \u201cWe haven\u2019t found a single body intact,\u201d said Patrick Touron, the deputy director of the police\u2019s criminal research institute. Identification experts were using dental records, DNA samples from family members, fingerprints, jewellery and bits of ID card to help the process. \n \n The black box, which is actually orange and weighs around 10kg, was originally in a protective casing, but only the empty casing has been found. \n \n Captain Yves Naffrechoux, a mountain ranger, told Agence France-Presse: \u201cIf it has not been completely destroyed or pulverised, the black box will be under the rubble and debris. We must work with caution and a lot of precision. We have to look under every last bit of plane and lift every rock.\u201d \n \n An access road was being built to the site to allow all-terrain vehicles to remove some of the larger parts of the plane. \n \n Prosecutors in France and Germany have suggested that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, deliberately crashed the plane. They have retrieved a torn-up sicknote from his flat in D\u00fcsseldorf, which was dated for the day of the disaster. Lubitz, who is from the small German town of Montabaur, had a history of depression which he hid from his employer and colleagues, they said. \n \n \n \n The suicide-mass murder theory is based on the cockpit voice recorder retrieved from the crash site near the village of Le Vernet. According to Germany\u2019s Bild am Sonntag newspaper, the captain, Patrick Sondheimer, asked Lubitz to prepare the plane to land in D\u00fcsseldorf. Lubitz responded \u201claconically\u201d. Sondheimer then left the cockpit to go to the toilet, telling his co-pilot: \u201cYou can take over.\u201d \n \n \n \n There was a sound of a seat being pushed back, and the door clicking shut. According to Bild, the plane then went into a steady descent. Minutes later there is a loud knocking and the voice of the captain saying: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake open the door.\u201d In the final moments the screams of passengers can be heard. \n \n \n \n German and European pilots\u2019 associations urged caution last week in stating the cause of the crash until the second black box was discovered and the air accident investigation brought to a conclusion. \n \n \n \n Jean-Pierre Michel, the head of the French investigation agency, said that some technical details of what precisely happened to the Airbus A320 aircraft were still missing. \u201cAt the moment we can\u2019t rule out the hypothesis of a technical fault,\u201d Michel told the French channel BFM TV. \n \n The German chief executive of the Airbus Group, Tom Enders, expressed his irritation on Sunday and criticised TV talkshow coverage of the disaster. \u201cThere has been speculation without facts, fantasy and lies,\u201d Enders said. Such \u201coutrageous nonsense\u201d mocked the victims, he added. \n \n \n \n In Montabaur, where Lubitz lived part of the time with his father, mother and younger brother, prayers were said on Sunday for the victims of the crash, and for the co-pilot and his grieving family. Hundreds of worshippers packed into St Peter\u2019s Catholic church on the town\u2019s cobbled main street, on a morning of pouring rain. \n \n \n \n Many there believed that investigators had been too quick to blame Lubitz for the disaster. Candles and flowers have been left outside the church, and one note read: \u201cWe think of all victims of this tragic crash, and their families and friends, in these difficult hours.\u201d \n \n The priest expressed sympathy for Lubitz\u2019s parents whom, he said, had found themselves \u201cat the centre of attention\u201d, the families and friends of the victims, and the rescue workers in France. \n \n ||||| Andreas Lubitz, 27, was living with the unnamed 26-year-old woman in his D\u00fcsseldorf apartment up until the crash last Tuesday, Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper and Der Spiegel magazine reported. \n \n She worked as a teacher at an unnamed comprehensive school in the state of North Rhine Westfalia and Bild said she had told her pupils that she was pregnant. Lubitz had also recently ordered two new cars for them. \n \n The woman \u2013 given the pseudonym, Sabine L, by Bild to protect her identity \u2013 visited the crash site last week, discovering on the way there that Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane, killing himself and 149 others. \n \n Sabine was said to have met Lubitz when the two were school students doing holiday jobs at a hamburger restaurant. \u201cEventually they no longer kept their relationship a secret,\u201d the former manager was quoted as saying. \n \n It is thought that Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane because he was deeply depressed and was being treated for vision problems that could have ended his flying career. Some sources suggested he was suffering from a detached retina. \n \n The reports came as a transcript of the last voice recordings was revealed yesterday, which reveals that Lubitz urged the pilot to go to the toilet, leaving him alone in the cockpit. Passengers can be heard screaming uncontrollably for minutes before the crash, according to details published by Bild am Sonntag. \n \n Over the course of the transcript, Lubitz can be heard telling Captain Patrick Sondheimer that he is ready to take over \u201cany time\u201d. \n \n As Capt Sondheimer orders Lubitz to prepare the plane for landing in D\u00fcsseldorf, Lubitz appears to give clues about what he is about to do, responding with \u201chopefully\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d. He then tells Capt Sondheimer: \u201cYou can go now\u201d. \n \n Two minutes later, the Captain says, \u201cyou can take over now\u201d and the sound of a cockpit seat sliding backwards is followed by the clicking of the cockpit door. \n \n Shortly after, Lubitz puts the aircraft into descent mode. Air traffic controllers can then be heard trying to contact the plane and the automatic \u201csink rate\u201d alarm starts sounding. \n \n Seconds later, there is thudding on the cockpit door. Capt Sondheimer can be heard shouting, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake open the door!\u201d Behind him, passengers can be heard screaming. Among the last sounds appear to be attempts by Capt Sondheimer to break down the door with the aircraft\u2019s emergency axe, as he shouts: \u201cOpen the goddam door.\u201d But to no avail. Shortly after, the plane\u2019s wing is heard scraping the side of a mountain. French officials have refused to confirm or deny the transcript.",

Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense.

MEET THE DIRECTORS: Allen and Albert Hughes open up GETTING BIBLICAL: Hollywood gets religion TRAILER: Get a read on 'The Book of Eli' FAITH AND REASON BLOG: Is every scripture-inspired script worthwhile? A month ago we had The Road, and a month before that it was 2012. The latest end-of-the-world movie is The Book of Eli, which looks as if it borrowed some of the ravaged landscape, battered clapboard houses and marauding extras from the world inhabited by Viggo Mortensen in The Road. Computer-generated images of toppled skyscrapers, severed freeways, decaying cars and rotting skeletons look numbingly familiar. But while devastation, disaster and brutality reign in all three movies, the difference here is the strident religious message. Poetic psalms uttered amid stylized violence are disconcerting. Religion and bloodshed, though linked through much of history, make queasy entertainment partners. An attractively grizzled Denzel Washington plays the enigmatic Eli, a true believer with quasi-mystical fighting skills. He walks the barren roads, fending off desperate highwaymen, with a leather-bound King James Bible stowed carefully in his ragged knapsack. Having received what he believes is divine revelation, Eli is on a mission to a place he refers to as \"west.\" He tries to avoid confrontation but puts up a hellacious fight if challenged. Only Eli and a few others remember how things were before the war that destroyed their world. Young people have not been taught to read. One of the few literates with potent memories is Carnegie (Gary Oldman in over-the-top villainous mode), a venal, self-styled dictator of a re-populated ghost town. When Carnegie learns that Eli has the book he's seeking, he's determined to wrest it away, for nefarious purposes. Carnegie tries to manipulate his adopted daughter, Solara (Mila Kunis), as he controls her mother, Claudia (Jennifer Beals). The feisty Solara sees in Eli a way out of her oppressive existence. But Kunis seems miscast. Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial. In an interview, Washington once recounted a pivotal story from his youth. A patron at his mother's hair salon known locally for being able to predict the future told him he would speak to millions, in the way of a preacher. Washington, who produced the film, seems to have taken the words of this neighborhood fortuneteller to heart. But his monosyllabic performance falls short of moving us. He keeps to himself, either passively listening to music on earphones or aggressively carving off the hand of someone who crossed him. \"You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back,\" he informs a hooligan before applying his magical machete. So much for turning the other cheek. Despite his admiration for Scripture, Eli is vicious. He also is selective about on whom he bestows kindness. He endangers an elderly couple (Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour) and is unmoved when they are slain. He'll protect Solara, a pretty young girl, but let her abused mother fend for herself. A didactic and humorless Western, Eli is too laborious for an action film and too brutal to be an inspirational tale. With its handsomely moody look, it seems more like an extended music video. Mostly, Eli is hampered by drab performances and a ponderous story. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

And truly, if one must wander a barren, post-apocalyptic landscape with somebody, who better to wander with than Denzel Washington? \n \n Washington is Eli, a man who has been walking for the 30 years since war laid waste to the planet. Survivors have long since turned desperate; imagine a cross between the worlds of \"The Road\" and \"Mad Max\" and you'll have an idea. It has gotten so grim that when strangers show up in a town, the first thing they're asked to do is hold out their hands, to see if they're steady. It seems that too much cannibalism leaves you with the shakes. \n \n Along with the provisions Eli scrounges along the way, he carries, with great care, a book. To him, it's clearly more than that, though. It's a totem of sorts, and he guards it with his life. \n \n There's much to guard it against, of course. But your run-of-the-mill roving savage is nothing compared with Carnegie (Gary Oldman). He runs the town that Eli finds himself in, and he wants the book, badly. He has, in fact, searched the world for it for years, sending bands of marauders out to find it. Its contents, he's convinced, are all he lacks to take over what's left of the world. \n \n Eli, naturally, will have none of it. He hasn't guarded the book all this time to hand it over to a guy so obviously devious that he lacks only a handlebar mustache to twirl. So he leaves the town, albeit violently, with Solara (Mila Kunis) in tow; she's had enough of Carnegie's mistreatment of her and her mother, Claudia (Jennifer Beals). (Like some survivors of the war, Claudia was blinded; Carnegie isn't exactly the picture of compassion.) \n \n A chase ensues, turning \"The Book of Eli\" into a mash-up of road trip action-adventure fare and that old reliable, the buddy movie. \n \n The film is better when Eli is on his own, frankly; Kunis is a fine-enough actress, but this is Washington at his most tail-kicking, if occasionally comic-book, intense - brooding, silent until pushed too far. But Solara does give him someone to protect and, more importantly, someone to explain the book's contents and importance to (although most of the audience will have figured that out long before). \n \n \"The Book of Eli\" is directed by the Hughes brothers, from a script by Gary Whitta. They bring the right touch to it, for the most part, though things get heavy-handed toward the end, when the message of the film is laid on a bit thick. \n \n The fun here is in watching Washington, a sort of avenging angel, and Oldman, who has a ball with Carnegie's trumped-up accent and scheming. Throw in the stylized look of the ruined landscape and you have a most agreeable film. \n \n One note: There is a bit of a twist, not obvious (at least not to me), which I pass along solely to heighten your observation of the film's details. It's more fun that way. \n \n Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter: goodyk. ||||| The clouds are gray, the scorched earth is gray, and the age-old nuclear ash falling from the sky is gray. If you look closely at Denzel Washington, as he saunters in slow motion through a bombed-out hotel lobby full of rotten-toothed ruffians, you can see that his hair and beard are flecked with gray as well. Is it just our imagination, or is the aridly desolate post-apocalyptic road movie showing its age? In the last 35 years or so, there have been an awful lot of them, going back to A Boy and His Dog (1976) and, of course, The Road Warrior (1982) \u0097 the greatest of all futuristic wasteland thrillers \u0097 and, most recently, The Road. I'm not sure if anyone was clamoring for another one of these films just now, but one thing is certain: We don't need The Book of Eli, a ponderous dystopian bummer that might be described as The Road Warrior without car chases, or The Road without humanity. \n \n What's left? A lot of wide-open barren desert space shot from music-video angles (think the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ''Give It Away''). The directors, Allen and Albert Hughes, do their best to make the landscape threatening by filling it with a token sprinkle of homicidal bikers and cannibals, plus Gary Oldman as an evil ringleader whose scariest aspect is his harshly photographed skin. Roving through it all is Washington's Eli, a monosyllabic lone gunslinger in a signature outfit of sunglasses, kaffiyeh, and knapsack packed with lethal blade. He's a mystical avenger who has been wandering through the wilderness for 30 years, toting a leather-bound King James Bible from which he plucks ominous quotes. He makes apocalyptic prophecy sound like a rerun. \n \n I'd be willing to forgive The Book of Eli its portentous sins if it had kick-ass action scenes, and every so often Eli does slice and dice the stuffing out of half a dozen hooligans at once, or he presides over a gun battle in which the bullets clatter and echo with full-metal zing. But those are just about the only scenes in the movie that have a pulse. At their best, the Hughes brothers have been brilliant directors: Their first film, the 1993 mind-of-a-gangbanger classic Menace II Society (made when they were just 20), established them as visceral and psychological prodigies, and the criminally underrated From Hell (2001) was a gothic-shock serial-killer mystery that featured Johnny Depp in one of his finest performances. (Had he been the mainstream superstar he is today back when the film was released, it might have been a sensation.) The Book of Eli is the first Hughes brothers movie that feels stripped of drama, imagination, sensibility. Some may find the film worth sitting through simply for its final ''Whoa!'' of a twist, but the Hughes brothers direct most of it as if they were glorified end-of-the-world set decorators. The Book of Eli is like a movie based on a graphic novel you don't want to read. D \n \n See all of this week's reviews ||||| 1.

Brown, who won his seat in a 2009 special election, was speaking on Boston radio station WZLX. \n \n Brown made his comments when asked about Warren's response in a debate Tuesday to a question about how she paid for college. The question referenced the fact that Brown posed nude for Cosmopolitan in 1982 to make money. \n \n \"I kept my clothes on,\" Warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job. \n \n \"Have you officially responded to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s comment about how she didn\u2019t take her clothes off?\" the host asked Brown Wednesday. \n \n \"Thank God!\" Brown said, laughing. \n \n The host got a kick out it, too. \"That\u2019s what I said!

She graduated from the University of Houston, a public school, though she spent her first two years at the private George Washington University on a debate scholarship. She later attended law school at Rutgers, a public university in New Jersey. Brown graduated from Tufts University and Boston College Law School. \n \n Brown reminded the host that they shared equally in the blame for the Warren crack. \n \n \"That\u2019s funny, you throw that jab,\" the host said, before Brown interjected: \"You said it, too!\" \n \n It was fair game, the host pointed out. \"Well, they said it about you!

That\u2019s what they said about you!\" \n \n Brown said he'd be happy to compete \"anytime they want to have a little road race, or a triathlon, or anything.\" \n \n Warren, a Harvard law school professor, was instrumental in establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Jacob, a... (Associated Press) \n \n TOWNVILLE, S.C. (AP) \u2014 A 6-year-old boy who died after a teen gunman opened fire at his South Carolina elementary school was dressed as Batman in his small blue casket on Wednesday. \n \n Jacob Hall's family encouraged mourners at his funeral to dress as superheroes as well. \n \n \"We want to honor Jacob, celebrate Jacob, in a way he would love,\" his great-aunt, Rebecca Hunnicutt, told the Anderson Independent-Mail (http://bit.ly/2dPTSqO). \n \n Jacob died from a bullet that struck the main artery in his thigh after a 14-year-old boy opened fire at Townville Elementary School. Authorities say the boy killed his own father and then drove a pickup truck to the school, crashing into a playground fence. A classmate and a first-grade teacher also were struck by bullets, and were treated and released from a hospital. \n \n Jacob had told his family he wanted to be a preacher one day, the Rev. Tim Marcengill told a crowd that packed the pews at the family's Oakdale Baptist Church. \"He's preaching today,\" Marcengill said. \n \n \"Jacob Lee hall, Townville's very own superhero, was born into our world, given to us as a gift and through those 6 years up until the very last moment of his life with us, God was and still is today accomplishing his purpose with Jacob,\" the reverend said. \n \n A fellow 6-year-old, Lily Gunby, sat in the pews wearing a pink and black Superman shirt. She said Jacob \"was really sweet,\" and \"knew a lot about Jesus.\" \n \n Lily's uncle Derek Gunby says Jacob was \"the cutest thing ever\" at the church's Bible school. \n \n John Buckland drove his Batmobile from West Virginia to attend the funeral. Wearing full Batman garb, he gave the kids posters saying \"Tough things make me stronger.\" \n \n \"We're here to celebrate,\" Buckland said. \"Take what we've learned from Jacob; let it make you a better husband, better father ... better everything.\" \n \n \"Keep an eye on each other. Care about each other, love each other. If someone's in trouble, reach out and give them the help they need, because Jacob would,\" he added. \n \n Townville Elementary school teachers also attended, wearing handmade blue capes with a Ninja Turtle face and Jacob's name on the back. Jacob's casket was decorated with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle stickers, and figurines of Ninja Turtles and Captain American were in a floral spray on top. \n \n The 14-year-old faces two murder charges in the deaths of his father and Jacob. He also is charged with three counts of attempted murder, as well as five counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. \n \n District Superintendent Joanne Avery announced a district-wide moment of silence at 1:42 p.m. Wednesday to mark one week since the shooting. Supporters also released hundreds of balloons Sunday in his honor, and people also crowded into the church Tuesday evening for Jacob's visitation. \n \n Students won't return to Townville Elementary until Thursday. \n \n But the district's other five schools planned to honor Jacob by participating in Superhero Day. All employees and students were invited to come to school in costume, and anyone wanting to attend the funeral would be excused, Avery said. \n \n According to a Facebook page created for Superhero Day, schools across the state planned to participate. But schools in central and coastal South Carolina were closed for the rest of the week because of the approach of Hurricane Matthew. \n \n Family members said Jacob told them he was out saving Townville as others slept. \n \n \"He loved anything to do with goodness,\" Jacob's mother, Renae Hall, told WYFF (http://bit.ly/2drFQvL). \"He loved anything to do with being able to help somebody. That's why I say Jacob was going to make a difference and he still is going to make a difference.\"",

The superhero theme was also dominant at Tuesday's visitation, which CNN notes more resembled a child's birthday party than a memorial service: There were balloons, flowers filled with stuffed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and family members in their own superhero attire greeting visitors in front of Jacob's coffin, which the AP notes was adorned with Ninja Turtle stickers. One man even drove his Batmobile from West Virginia to pay his respects at the funeral. \"Jacob Lee Hall, Townville's very own superhero, was \u2026 given to us as a gift, and through those six years up until the very last moment of his life with us, God was and still is today accomplishing his purpose with Jacob,\" said the reverend who spoke to the gathered well-wishers Wednesday.",

Then, in 2017, Kerry said that 100,000 would be accepted. \n \n That adds up to 185,000 over two years. But this would be the total number of refugees, not the number of refugees from Syria. \n \n By law, the president every fiscal year sets the maximum number of refugees the United States can accept in a year. Over the past decade, the annual limit has been between 70,000 and 80,000, according to the Congressional Research Service. So, 100,000 in 2017 would be a big jump, assuming Obama goes through with the pledge to authorize that level. \n \n But for Syria, Obama has only directed the United States to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year. That\u2019s an increase of six times from 2015, but it\u2019s hardly the flood that Trump worries about. In fact, in the interview with MSNBC, Trump indicated he would be fine with just 10,000. \n \n So his worries appear to be based on a misunderstanding. \n \n As Emily Litella would say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s different. Never mind.\u201d \n \n The Pinocchio Test \n \n Trump needs to quit using the 200,000 figure for the number of Syrians the administration has signaled it would accept \u2014 and reporters need to challenge him when he repeats it.

If it\u2019s a lie too vile to utter aloud, count on Mr. Trump to say it, often. It wins him airtime, and retweets through the roof. \n \n This phenomenon is in fact nothing new. Politicians targeting minorities, foreigners or women have always existed in the culture. And every generation or so, at least one demagogue surfaces to fan those flames. \n \n Here\u2019s Donald Trump on Sunday: \u201cWhen the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re ISIS, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a Trojan horse.

It\u2019s no easy task for journalists to interrupt Mr. Trump with the facts, but it\u2019s an important one. ||||| THE GROWING ugliness of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign poses a challenge to us all. We have seen the likes of him before, in the United States and elsewhere: narcissistic bullies who rise to prominence by spreading lies, appealing to fears and stoking hatred. Such people are dangerous. \n \n Like many Americans, our first inclination was to ignore Mr. Trump. The Huffington Post, you may recall, announced that it would feature him in its Entertainment section, not in its coverage of politics. He was a buffoon, a disseminator of ludicrous rumors about President Obama\u2019s birthplace. He lacked the qualifications, experience or knowledge to be president. He was running to promote his brand. We wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction. \n \n Our assessment of Mr. Trump was correct, but the tactical response was not. His popular support has hung steady at about 30 percent of Republicans, and his candidacy has tugged the debate toward divisiveness as his bigotry has drawn cheers and many of his rivals have strove to mimic him. Now some detractors opt again to disregard his lies, but for a different reason: Criticism from establishment politicians and tough questions from establishment journalists, it is feared, will only fuel his self-portrayal as the truth-telling outsider. \n \n That may be so, but it cannot justify silence. Just in the past few days, Mr. Trump has repeated the lie that President Obama intends to admit 200,000 Syrian refugees; the correct number is 10,000. He spreads the lie that thousands of American Muslims openly celebrated the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center; in fact, there were no such celebrations. He tweeted a false statistic that blacks are responsible for 81 percent of murders of white victims; in fact, 82 percent of whites are killed by whites. \n \n These are not random errors. All of them appeal to the basest instincts in supporters; they reinforce fears and prejudices. All of them, Mr. Trump knows by now even if he did not know when he first stated them, are false, but he does not care. The amplification of the lies is accompanied by growing intolerance in his campaign, with Mr. Trump praising supporters for beating a protestor, crudely denigrating anyone who challenges him and penning reporters into designated zones so that they cannot speak with his followers. And all of this matches the brutality of his policies: mass deportation of longtime U.S. residents, torture of foreign detainees, expulsion even of refugees who are here legally . \n \n A few candidates, such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have spoken out against some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more outlandish comments. Many more, sadly, duck and cover, hoping to avoid Mr. Trump\u2019s insults or to ingratiate themselves with his backers. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is probably the most egregious of these second-rate flatterers, but he\u2019s far from alone. Asked about the mythical cheering crowds, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said, \u201cI think if it had happened, I would remember it, but, you know, there could be things I forget, too.\u201d \n \n No, that is not something Mr. Christie would have forgotten, and he ought to say so. Other Republican leaders should speak up too: the speaker of the House and majority leader of the Senate, for example, and former president George W. Bush. The more reticent such leaders are, the more successfully Mr. Trump can brand their party and, to a disturbing extent, the nation with his demagoguery.

By contrast, he said \"Be Your Way\" is about making a connection with a person's greater lifestyle. \n \n \"We want to evolve from just being the functional side of things to having a much stronger emotional appeal,\" said Machado, who joined the company in March. \n \n Whether the new tag line can help Burger King's image over the long term remains to be seen. The company, along with McDonald's Corp., is fighting to boost sales at a time when people are moving toward foods they feel are fresher or higher quality. And Laura Ries, president of the brand consulting firm Ries & Ries, noted that companies can come across as trying too hard to be cool. \n \n \"The problem is that people don't see themselves as living the Burger King lifestyle,\" she said. \"You've got to be realistic with the place that your brand holds in real life.\" \n \n Burger King says new slogan was developed with ad agency DAVID, a unit of WPP. \n \n Machado noted that Burger King hasn't been actively using the \"Have It Your Way\" slogan for some time in the U.S. The company, which is based in Miami, Florida, also will stop using its more recent \"Taste Is King\" motto. \"Be Your Way\" will start in the U.S. but eventually be rolled out globally, the company says. \n \n The switch is the latest in a series of marketing and menu changes under Burger King's new management. The chain was bought by investment firm 3G Capital in late 2010, then taken public again in 2012. Soon after, 3G replaced the chain's CEO and early this year, Axel Schwan was appointed as global chief marketing officer. \n \n In the latest quarter, Burger King said sales at U.S. restaurants open at least a year edged up 0.1 percent, hurt by bad weather. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| Burger King \u2014 ever aspiring for pop-culture coolness \u2014 is tweaking its slogan to something slightly hipper: \u201d Be Your Way.\u201d \n \n That would, perhaps, be Millennial-speak for the more dated but culturally iconic \u201cHave it Your Way.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe want to be talked about and connected to pop culture,\u201d says Fernando Machado, senior VP of global brand management at Burger King Worldwide, in a phone interview. \u201cWe want to be an iconic brand way beyond quick-service restaurants.\u201d \n \n That, of course, doesn\u2019t come simply.

(Burger King says a Whopper sandwich, for example, technically can be ordered 221,184 different ways.) \n \n For what it\u2019s worth, BK\u2019s had a decent first half of 2014 \u2014 with its stock up more than 9% over the first five months. \n \n Just maybe the new slogan puts BK slightly more in tune with the more Millennial-friendly slogans at McDonald\u2019s (\u201cI\u2019m Loving It\u201d) and Taco Bell (\u201cLive Mas\u201d). \n \n Or you could combine all three into: \u201cMas Live Lovin\u2019 Your Way.\u201d ||||| Something weird is happening to the country\u2019s premier purveyors of mass-produced hamburger-like substances. \n \n First, we have McDonald\u2019s, the Godzilla of fast food joints.

That\u2019s great! Wholesome eating is terrific, good for McDonald\u2019s. So what does the new Happy Meal character look like? \n \n Well! That\u2019s certainly not a living nightmare that will terrify children and discourage them from ever considering fruits or vegetables. \n \n Happy, the McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal Box Who Came To Life Because You Didn\u2019t Clean Your Room Last Night, was first introduced in France in 2009 before making its (his?) way across Europe and into Latin America, McDonald\u2019s says. \n \n Meanwhile, stepping away from anthropomorphic terror for a moment, we have Burger King. The company is apparently moving away from the \u201cHave It Your Way\u201d slogan and pitching a new one, Ad Age reports. \n \n The new slogan? \u201cBe Your Way.\u201d \n \n As for why they are moving from \u201cHave It Your Way\u201d to the grammatically-questionable \u201cBe Your Way,\u201d here\u2019s Ad Age: \n \n According to the press release, the new tagline \u201creminds people that no matter who they are, they can order how they want to in Burger King restaurants and that they can and should live how they want anytime. It\u2019s OK to not be perfect. Self-expression is most important and it\u2019s our differences that make us individuals instead of robots.\u201d So why bother changing the tagline? Fernando Machado, the chain\u2019s senior VP-global brand marketing, said that while \u201cHave It Your Way\u201d was more about the \u201cfunctional side\u201d of Burger King, letting customers know that customization was always an option. \n \n This seems like a good time to remind you that in April, Burger King announced the Chicken Big King sandwich with a press released headlined \u201cBurger King Is Not Clucking Around.\u201d \n \n Okay, just out of curiosity, what is going on with Wendy\u2019s these days? \n \n Caption this!

    "document": "The American Cancer Society\u2019s estimates for melanoma skin cancer in the United States for 2015 are: \n \n About 73,870 new cases of melanoma \n \n About 9,940 deaths from melanoma \n \n Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers. Melanoma accounts for less than 2% of skin cancers. But it causes most skin cancer deaths. \n \n The number of new cases of melanoma in the United States has been rising for at least 30 years. \n \n Overall, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 1 in 40 for whites, 1 in 1,000 for blacks, and 1 in 200 for Hispanics. But each person\u2019s risk is also affected by other factors. \n \n Unlike many other common cancers, melanoma occurs in both younger and older people. But the risk goes up with age. ||||| Researchers at King's College London have investigated a new method that could be used by GPs to quickly determine the number of moles on the entire body by counting the number found on a smaller 'proxy' body area, such as an arm. \n \n Naevus (mole) count is one of the most important markers of risk for skin cancer despite only 20 to 40 per cent of melanoma arising from pre-existing moles. The risk is thought to increase by two to four per cent per additional mole on the body, but counting the total number on the entire body can be time consuming in a primary care setting. \n \n Previous studies on a smaller scale have attempted to identify mole count on certain body sites as a proxy to accurately estimate the number on the body as a whole and found that the arm was the most predictive. \n \n This study, funded by the Wellcome Trust, used a much larger sample of participants to identify the most useful 'proxy' site for a full body mole count as well as the 'cut off' number of moles that can be used to predict those at the highest risk of developing skin cancer. \n \n The researchers used data from 3594 female Caucasian twins between January 1995 and December 2003 as part of the TwinsUK study protocol. Twins underwent a skin examination including recording skin type, hair and eye colour and freckles as well as mole count on 17 body sites performed by trained nurses. This was then replicated in a wider sample of male and female participants from a UK melanoma case control study published previously. \n \n Scientists found that the count of moles on the right arm was most predictive of the total number on the whole body. Females with more than seven moles on their right arm had nine times the risk of having more than 50 on the whole body and those with more than 11 on their right arm were more likely to have over 100 on their body in total, meaning they were at a higher risk of developing a melanoma. \n \n These findings could help GPs to more easily identify those at the highest risk of developing a melanoma (skin cancer). \n \n Scientists also found that the area above the right elbow was particularly predictive of the total body count of moles. The legs were also strongly associated with the total count as well as the back area in males. \n \n Lead author, Simone Ribero of the Department of Twin Research & Genetic Epidemiology said: 'This study follows on from previous work to identify the best proxy site for measuring the number of moles on the body as a whole. The difference here is that it has been done on a much larger scale in a healthy Caucasian population without any selection bias and subsequently replicated in a case control study from a similar healthy UK population, making the results more useful and relevant for GPs. \n \n 'The findings could have a significant impact for primary care, allowing GPs to more accurately estimate the total number of moles in a patient extremely quickly via an easily accessible body part. This would mean that more patients at risk of melanoma can be identified and monitored.' \n \n ### ||||| Skin Cancer Facts \n \n What does the skin do? \n \n The skin is the largest organ of the body. It does many things, such as: \n \n Covers your internal organs and protects them from injury \n \n Serves as a barrier to germs \n \n Keeps you from losing too much water and other fluids \n \n Helps control your body temperature \n \n Protects the rest of your body from ultraviolet (UV) rays \n \n Helps your body make vitamin D \n \n How common is skin cancer? \n \n Skin cancer is the most common cancer. About 5.4 million basal and squamous cell skin cancers are diagnosed each year. (These are found in about 3.3 million Americans; some people have more than one.) Melanoma, the most deadly type of skin cancer, will account for about 76,380 cases of skin cancer in 2016. \n \n Types of skin cancers \n \n Skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer. If you have skin cancer, it\u2019s important to know which type you have because it affects your treatment options and your outlook (prognosis). \n \n Basal and squamous cell skin cancers \n \n These types of skin cancers start in the basal cells or squamous cells of the skin, which is how they get their names. These cells are in the outer layer of your skin. \n \n Most basal and squamous cell cancers develop on sun-exposed areas of your skin, like the face, ears, neck, lips, and the backs of your hands. \n \n Basal cell cancers tend to grow slowly and rarely spread to other parts of the body. Squamous cell cancers are more likely to grow into deeper layers of skin and spread, but this is not common. \n \n Both basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers can be cured if found and treated early \u2013 when they are small and have not spread. But either type can cause problems if left untreated. \n \n You can learn more about these skin cancers at Skin Cancer: Basal and Squamous Cell. \n \n Melanoma skin cancer \n \n Melanoma is a cancer that starts in melanocytes \u2013 the cells that make the brown skin pigment known as melanin, which gives skin its color. Melanin helps protect the deeper layers of the skin from sun damage. \n \n Melanoma can start on nearly any part of the skin, even in places that aren\u2019t normally exposed to the sun, like the genital or anal areas. Melanoma most often affects the skin (including under the nails), but it can also start in other parts of the body, such as in the eyes or mouth. \n \n Melanoma is almost always curable when it\u2019s found in very early stages. Melanoma accounts for only a small percentage of skin cancers, but it\u2019s much more likely to grow and spread to other parts of the body, where it can be hard to treat. Because of this, melanoma causes most skin cancer deaths, accounting for more than 10,000 of the more than 13,650 skin cancer deaths each year. \n \n You can learn more at Melanoma Skin Cancer. \n \n Other types of skin cancer \n \n There are many other types of skin cancer, such as Merkel cell carcinoma, skin lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, skin adnexal tumors, and sarcomas. These are all much less common than basal or squamous cell cancers or melanomas. \n \n Skin cancer risk factors \n \n Risk factors for skin cancer include: \n \n Too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (from sunlight or tanning beds and lamps) \n \n Pale skin (easily sunburned, doesn\u2019t tan much or at all, natural red or blond hair) \n \n Exposure to large amounts of coal tar, paraffin, arsenic compounds, or certain types of oil \n \n You or members of your family have had skin cancers \n \n Multiple or unusual moles \n \n Severe sunburns in the past \n \n Weakened immune system \n \n Older age (although melanomas are also found in younger people) \n \n Signs and symptoms of skin cancer \n \n Skin cancer can be found early, and you and your health care providers play key roles in finding skin cancer. Learn how to examine your skin for changes. If you have any of these symptoms, see a provider: \n \n Any change on your skin, especially in the size or color of a mole, growth, or spot, or a new growth (even if it has no color) \n \n Scaliness, roughness, oozing, bleeding, or a change in the way an area of skin looks \n \n A sore that doesn\u2019t heal \n \n The spread of pigment (color) beyond its border, such as dark coloring that spreads past the edge of a mole or mark \n \n A change in sensation, such as itchiness, tenderness, or pain \n \n To see some examples of different types of skin cancers, see our Skin Cancer Image Gallery. \n \n Can skin cancer be prevented? \n \n The best ways to help lower your risk of skin cancer is to stay out of intense sunlight and practice sun safety. You can still exercise and enjoy the outdoors while practicing sun safety at the same time. Here are some ways to be sun safe: ||||| People who have 11 or more moles on one of their arms could have a higher risk of the deadly skin cancer melanoma, according to a new study. \n \n Researchers counted the number of moles that study participants had on 17 sites on the skin of their bodies \u2014 such as the left leg, the chest and the back \u2014 and found that the arms were the site that was the best indicator of the total number of moles on the whole body. \n \n For example, women with at least seven moles on an arm were nine times more likely to have at least 50 moles on their entire body than those who had fewer than seven moles on their right arm. And those with at least 11 moles on an arm were more likely to have at least 100 moles on their whole body \u2014 a sign of a drastically increased risk of skin cancer. \n \n The findings suggest that the arm could be the best place to look to estimate the number of moles on the whole body. \"Many different body sites were predictive of total body mole count, but at the end, the strongest one was the arm,\" said lead study author Simone Ribero, a research fellow at King's College London, adding that the right or left arm work as a good indicator of the total number of moles on the whole body. [5 Things You Must Know About Skin Cancer ] \n \n There will be an estimated 74,000 new cases of melanoma in the United States in 2015, and 10,000 of those people will die of the disease this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. \n \n The total number of moles a person has is an important marker that can help determine their risk of skin cancer, according to the researchers. \n \n In the new study, the researchers looked at data from 3,694 female Caucasian twins who were taking part in a long-running study of twins in the United Kingdom, called the TwinsUK study. Between January 1995 and December 2003, the participants underwent a skin examination in which researchers recorded their skin type, eye color and freckles, hair color and moles. \n \n The researchers also confirmed the link they found between total mole count and the number of moles on the right arm using data from another study, which included male and female participants. \n \n Two other body sites \u2014 the area above the right elbow, and the legs \u2014 were also found to be particularly predictive of a person's total body mole count. In men, the number of moles on the back was a good indicator of total mole count as well, the researchers said. \n \n A person's melanoma risk is thought to increase by 2 to 4 percent with each additional mole on the body, the researchers said. However, determining the total number of moles on the whole body can be difficult and time-consuming. \n \n \"Every dermatologist and physician in general knows that the risk of melanoma increases with the total body number of moles, but counting moles is a very long procedure,\" Riberosaid. \"We hope that this technique will be helpful for this.\" \n \n However, there are other factors that may better determine a person's risk of melanoma, said Dr. Hooman Khorasani, chief of dermatologic and cosmetic surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who was not involved in the study. \n \n \"Genetic composition is way more important, as well as how the moles look,\" Khorasani said. For example, moles that doctors call \"dysplastic nevi,\" which are unusual, benign moles butthat resemble moles that indicate the presence of melanoma are essential to distinguish from other moles because they signal an increased cancer risk. \n \n According to the American Cancer Society, people with greater exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, and those with fair skin, freckles, light hair or a family history of melanoma face an increased risk of melanoma. \n \n \"It's more important that you look at a person's risk factors than count the number of moles on their arm,\" Khorasani said. \n \n The study was published Monday (Oct. 19) in the British Journal of Dermatology. \n \n Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

And there's a specific number that could serve as a warning sign: Find more than 11 moles on that arm, and your risk of melanoma could be higher. Researchers looked at data from nearly 4,000 female Caucasian twins who were studied between 1995 and 2003. They counted the number of moles on 17 body sites and found women who had at least seven moles on their right arm were nine times more likely to have at least 50 moles all over their body, and that when they had more than 11 moles on their right arm, they were likely to have more than 100 moles\u2014signifying \"a drastically increased risk of skin cancer,\" per Live Science.

According to a study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, doctors can now use a computer program to estimate a patient's risk of melanoma based on the size and location of the moles on his or her chest, abdomen, and thighs. \"This could have a significant impact for primary care,\" study co-author Dr. Supat Thammasitboon says in a press release. \"It could mean that more patients at risk ofMelanoma can be identified and monitored.\" According to the American Cancer Society, melanoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is responsible for more than half of all cancer-related deaths in the US. Researchers found that people who had more than 10 moles on their chest and abdomen were twice as likely to have melanoma than people who didn't have any moles. The study was based on a review of medical records from more than 5,600 people in the UK and the US, all of whom had at least 10 moles. Researchers were able to estimate the risk of developing melanoma by using the moles' location and size, as well as the age, gender, and moles' molest size.

In fact, skin cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, after lung cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. And that's why the New York Times is out with a list of the top 10 things you need to know about skin cancer, including the fact that it is the No. 1 cancer killer of Americans between the ages of 15 and 44. Here's a look at those 10, along with the number of Americans who die from it each year: \u2013 If you've got at least 11 moles on an arm, you're more likely to have at least 100 on your whole body, according to a new study published Monday in the British Journal of Dermatology. \"Many different body sites were predictive of total body mole count, but at the end, the strongest one was the arm,\" says lead author Simone Ribero, a research fellow at King's College London, per LiveScience. Researchers looked at data from 3,694 female Caucasian twins who took part in a long-running study of twins in the UK called the TwinsUK study. The subjects had their skin tested, including eye color, freckles, moles, and hair color. The arm was the best place for researchers to count the number of moles on a person's whole body. Women with at least seven moles on their arm were nine times more likely than those with fewer than seven on their right arm to have a total of at least 50 on their entire body, while the figure for those with at 11 on their arms was more than 100, researchers say. \"Every dermatologist and physician in general knows that the risk of melanoma increases with the total body number of mole, but counting moles is a very long procedure,\" a dermatologist not involved in the",

As of Oct. 3, the university's outside law firms have billed it for $4.1 million, a figure that will grow significantly as it does not include work performed by its most expensive law firm after June. \n \n On Tuesday, attorneys representing the women and girls and all the defendants with the exception of USA Gymnastics filed a stipulation and proposed order to extend the mediation by 30 days, to Dec. 6. \n \n \"Plaintiffs and the MSU Defendants have sought the concurrence of defendant USA Gymnastics for this stipulation, and it has not yet provided its position,\" attorneys wrote in the motion filed in federal court in Grand Rapids. \n \n A message was left seeking comment from USA Gymnastics. \n \n Related: At MSU: Assault, harassment and secrecy \n \n Related: Larry Nassar and a career filled with \u2018silenced\u2019 voices \n \n Related: Judge won't allow Nassar's child porn convictions to be used during sex assault trial \n \n The mediator for the lawsuits, Jon Muth, wrote to the judge that the parties have \"significant work\" to do if they're going to reach a resolution, but that \"substantial progress\" has been made, according to court records. \n \n Nassar worked for decades as a doctor at MSU and with USA Gymnastics. Last year, following a story in the Indianapolis Star, dozens of women and girls began to report sexual assaults by Nassar during medical appointments, some dating back decades. \n \n MSU fired Nassar shortly after the Indy Star story. He left USA Gymnastics in fall 2015 with little notice. \n \n Nassar faces 22 sexual assault charges in state courts, all but three relate to his role as a doctor. In December, he will be sentenced on three federal child pornography charges. \n \n Rising legal fees \n \n MSU is paying five law firms for work related to the Nassar lawsuits, including one that the university has said is handling the \"insurance aspects.\" \n \n That law firm, Latham & Watkins, has billed MSU for $754,853 since June. Its invoices include one for $264,186 sent in September for 337 hours performed in August. \n \n The law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is the university's most expensive.

A third Olympian, Sydney bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, has also said she was abused by Nassar. \n \n According to the Lansing State Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, more than 140 women have alleged sexual abuse by Nassar, under the guise of medical treatment. \n \n Nassar was the USA Gymnastics\u2019 team physician for nearly 20 years, beginning in 1996. He was fired by USA Gymnastics in the summer of 2015, but the federation waited five weeks before alerting the FBI.

The Indianapolis Star, also part of the USA TODAY Network, has reported more than 360 cases in which gymnasts have accused coaches of sexual transgressions over 20 years. \n \n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the Olympic champion or you\u2019re an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the United States,\u201d Raisman said in a joint interview with USA TODAY Sports and The Associated Press in August, when she and her Final Five teammates from Rio were inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame. \n \n \u201cEvery single kid is important, and I want USA Gymnastics to do a better job with that.\u201d \n \n Raisman declined to detail her interactions with Nassar during the August interview, saying she wanted to keep the focus on the scandal and its overall impact. \n \n \u201cIt's important to speak up for something and it's right. It's the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cMore people need to talk about it and I just feel that it's not getting enough attention in the sport. That's what bothers me. I want these young girls to know. It should have never ever happened and I think that needs to be discussed more.\u201d \n \n Last month, Maroney came forward in a Twitter post, saying Nassar abused her under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar abused her until she left the sport, Maroney wrote, adding, \"It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was 'treated.'\" \n \n Maroney said Nassar abused her before the U.S. team won gold in the 2012 Olympics and before she won silver on vault. \n \n At the 2011 world championships, Maroney said Nassar gave her a sleeping pill \"and the next thing I know I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a 'treatment.' I thought I was going to die that night.\" She was 15 at the time. \n \n Maroney shared her account in October with the #MeToo hashtag. \n \n \"People should know that this is not just happening in Hollywood,\" Maroney wrote. \"This is happening everywhere. Wherever there is a position of power, there seems to be potential for abuse. I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting.\"' \n \n Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges in July, and he faces 22 to 27 years in prison when he\u2019s sentenced on Dec. 7. He also faces 33 charges of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan. \n \n The sex abuse scandal led to the ouster of USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny, who resigned in March under pressure from the U.S. Olympic Committee. USA Gymnastics announced this week that Kerry Perry, formerly the vice president of business development at Learfield Communications, would start as CEO on Dec. 1. \n \n USA Gymnastics hired former federal prosecutor Deborah Daniels to review its practices, and her report found USA Gymnastics needed a \u201ccomplete cultural change\u201d so safety and well-being of athletes was a greater priority than world and Olympic medals. \n \n USA Gymnastics has adopted all 70 recommendations made by Daniels and is in the process of implementing them. Some have already been addressed with the opening of the U.S. Center for Safe Sport, an independent agency created by the USOC to handle sexual misconduct cases in the Olympic movement. \n \n In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it was \"appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused, and we are very sorry that any athlete has been harmed during her or his gymnastics career.\" \n \n \"Aly\u2019s passion and concern for athlete safety is shared by USA Gymnastics,\" the statement said. \"We are committed to doing what is right, and we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.\" \n \n PHOTOS: Every medal won by U.S. athletes in Rio ||||| Aly Raisman, a six-time Olympic medalist and two-time national team captain, said she was sexually abused by former Michigan State and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, according to CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" \n \n Nassar already faces 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and could receive a sentence of life in prison. \n \n Raisman told \"60 Minutes,\" in an interview scheduled to air Sunday, that she spoke to FBI investigators after serving as national team captain at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. In the interview, Raisman said she didn't know why it took so long for allegations against Nassar to come forward. \n \n Gymnast Aly Raisman won three Olympic gold medals -- and six medals overall -- while serving as national team captain at the 2012 Games in London and 2016 Games in Rio. Jean Catuffe/Getty Images \n \n \"Why are we looking at why didn't the girls speak up? Why not look at what about the culture?\" she said. \"What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?\" \n \n Now 23, Raisman told \"60 Minutes\" that she started seeing Nassar when she was 15. She details the abuse in her book \"Fierce,\" which will be released on Nov. 14. \n \n USA Gymnastics said in a statement Friday that Raisman sharing her personal experience took \"great courage\" and it is \"appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused.\" \n \n Raisman, who was also captain of the team for the 2012 Games in London, is the second member of the \"Fierce Five\" U.S. women's gymnastics team -- and third Olympian overall -- to allege abuses by Nassar. Just last month, Raisman offered her support to McKayla Maroney after she alleged abuse by Nassar dating back to 2009, when she was just 13. \n \n Nassar was involved with USA Gymnastics for nearly three decades as a trainer and national medical coordinator, a role that led him to treat the country's elite gymnasts at four separate Olympic Games. \n \n Editor's Picks Gold medalist Maroney alleges abuse by Nassar Olympic gold-medal gymnast McKayla Maroney has alleged that former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar abused her as early as age 13. \n \n Perry to lead USA Gymnastics following scandal Kerry Perry replaces Steve Penny, who resigned in March after 12 years as president following criticism over the way USA Gymnastics handled sexual abuse claims. 1 Related \n \n During the 2017 national championships in August, Raisman declined to get into specifics about whether she was abused by Nassar, but she painted a vivid picture of how Nassar's behavior went unchecked. \n \n \"I think that, you just want, you want to trust people and that he was just a disgusting person, he took advantage of so many people's trust,\" Raisman told The Associated Press and USA Today Sports. \"And I think, it just disgusts me he was a doctor. It's crazy. Because when a doctor says something you want to believe him and it's just awful.\" \n \n USA Gymnastics, in a statement to \"60 Minutes,\" said it was \"very sorry that any athlete has been harmed\" and that \"we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe.\" \n \n More than 140 women are now suing Nassar and his former employer, Michigan State University. The plaintiffs are also suing USA Gymnastics and other defendants. Attorneys for the alleged victims, USA Gymnastics, the school and other parties to the lawsuit are engaged in court-ordered mediation in an effort to reach a settlement. Attorneys have said that more women are expected to join the lawsuits. \n \n It is not known whether Raisman or Maroney are part of those lawsuits. \n \n Nassar has already pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and is in jail, awaiting a Dec. 7 sentencing in that case. \n \n He also faces charges in state court in Michigan, largely related to allegations that he digitally penetrated women during medical exams for his own sexual gratification. If convicted on any one of the 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Nassar could be sentenced to life in prison. \n \n In the past, Nassar and his attorneys have defended the intra-vaginal and intra-rectal procedures as accepted medical practice. \n \n Nassar was a trainer with USA Gymnastics as far back as 1986. In 1996, he was named national medical coordinator, a position he held until the summer of 2015. Nassar resigned his position from USA Gymnastics shortly after concerns were raised about his behavior during medical exams. \n \n USA Gymnastics never informed Nassar's employer at the time, Michigan State University, about the circumstances surrounding Nassar's resignation, and he continued to treat patients in Michigan until he was fired by the school in September 2016. \n \n Raisman has called for change within the sport. \n \n \"I am angry,\" Raisman told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm really upset because it's been -- I care a lot, you know, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, I just ... I can't ... every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think ... I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.\" \n \n Raisman has also called for sweeping changes in leadership, including the removal of the chairman of the board, Paul Parilla. USA Gymnastics hired Kerry Perry as its new president and CEO on Tuesday after president Steve Penny resigned in March after 12 years on the job. \n \n Raisman and Maroney are the highest-profile gymnasts yet to come forward publicly claiming abuse by Nassar. Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, was part of the initial wave of lawsuits filed against Nassar in 2016. \n \n The list of Nassar's accusers also includes several former national team members. Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard and Kami MacKay have all come forward, alleging abuse by Nassar either through the filing of lawsuits or, in the case of MacKay, on social media. \n \n USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar in the summer of 2016, following reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country. \n \n In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review. The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so. The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport. Part of Stark's mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services. \n \n ESPN's John Barr and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "document": "BOSTON (Reuters) - A Boston-area man accused of threatening to blow up an airplane allegedly had all the materials needed to build a pressure-cooker bomb before this kind of weapon was used in the Boston Marathon attack in April, according to comments made by the man\u2019s mother in a recently unsealed police affidavit. \n \n Flowers lay on the sidewalk at the site of the first explosion as people walk along Boylston Street after the street reopened to the public for the first time since the Boston Marathon bombings in Boston, Massachusetts April 24, 2013. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi \n \n While investigators working with the FBI are looking to see if there are any links between the two cases, they have drawn no conclusions, according to two law enforcement sources. Prosecutors and the FBI declined to comment. \n \n The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force said it is investigating 27-year-old Daniel Morley after police in the small town of Topsfield, Massachusetts found a cache of weapons and bomb-making materials in his home on June 9. \n \n According to a police affidavit dated June 19, Morley told his mother that his best friend had bragged about knowing Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the two Chechen brothers suspected of detonating pressure-cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15. Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police after the attack. \n \n No one else has been charged in the Topsfield case, a spokeswoman for the Essex County District Attorney said. \n \n The 25-page police affidavit details the allegations that served as the basis for the criminal charges against Morley. He is accused of assaulting his mother and her boyfriend and making a threat to hijack an airplane or ship. \n \n Morley\u2019s defense attorney, Robert LeBlanc, did not return calls asking for comment. The person described by Morley\u2019s mother as his best friend was named in the affidavit. Reuters could not reach him for comment. \n \n Topsfield police said they found in Morley\u2019s bedroom closet a large, stainless steel pressure cooker and a black duffel bag. He also had materials to make a shrapnel bomb, such as black powder, igniters and pieces of metal that included ball bearings. In addition, he had a large assault rifle and a handgun, the affidavit shows. \n \n Morley\u2019s mother told police that her son had the pressure cooker and the other materials before the Boston Marathon attacks, according to the affidavit. \n \n AMMUNITION AND A DRAWING \n \n Police said they also found several hundred rounds of ammunition and a drawing of what appeared to be the Boston skyline, with an airplane in the left hand corner and a figure of a man with a blue heart in his chest, holding a red heart in his hand. \n \n \u201cWhile very stylized, the image does seem to match up with a portion of the Boston skyline,\u201d the affidavit quoted anti-terrorism expert Clairissa Breen, who is part of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, as saying. \u201cThis could mean that something in that area is a target, or it could be artistic license.\u201d \n \n The allegations outlined in the affidavit prompted the Topsfield police to contact the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. One focus of the FBI\u2019s investigation is determining whether Morley was being influenced by others when he made the alleged airplane threat, according to the affidavit. \n \n Police also said they found a shoe box with the head of a decapitated bird, dismantled cell phones, flex cuff restraints, black gun powder, and a burnt green stuffed animal that had been stabbed repeatedly. Other items included a bucket with aluminum foil and steel containers with concealment cutouts. \n \n Police said they discovered all of the items last month after Morley told his mother and her boyfriend that he planned to burn down their house. Morley had moved in with them after being hit by a car while riding his bike in Boston. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s all been a big shock. I can\u2019t really help you,\u201d said Morley\u2019s mother, Glenda Duckworth, when contacted by Reuters. \n \n Morley was placed in custody on June 9 after a nearly four-hour standoff that closed Topsfield\u2019s picturesque town center. \n \n He is described by his mother in the search warrant affidavit as very bright, but troubled. After being arrested, police said he apologized to them for not taking his medications, which were not detailed in the affidavit. \n \n Morley is undergoing psychiatric evaluation at Bridgewater State Hospital, according to his criminal case file put together by prosecutors. His next court appearance is set for Thursday at Ipswich District Court in Newburyport. \n \n \u201cMorley advised his mother that he separated from (his best friend) because he was attempting to have him do something really bad, but Daniel did not want to do,\u201d according to the police affidavit. ||||| UPDATE: Topsfield man arrested after bomb scare; Pressure cooker found in home. \n \n A Topsfield man was arrested on bomb scare charges early Sunday morning, June 9 after a domestic disturbance call led the police to his Washington Street home where they found a pressure cooker in his possession. \n \n Police say Daniel P. Morley, 27, made threats that the pressure cooker was explosive, which led them to call in the state police Special Tactical Operations (STOP) team. Middleton, Wenham and a couple other police departments and ambulance personnel also responded to the scene. \n \n Topsfield Police Chief Evan Haglund said that the device was ultimately found to be non-explosive. \n \n Morley also threatened to burn down the residence. \n \n He was charged with communicating a bomb scare, threatening to commit arson and two counts of domestic assault and battery. \n \n Police were initially called to the residence at 2:46 a.m. on Sunday morning when family members reported that Morley assaulted and threatened them. Officers investigated the residence and found a loaded bolt-action rifle, handgun, ammunition and knives in the suspect\u2019s bedroom, according to police. Police then found the pressure cooker, which is when they called the STOP team. \n \n Once STOP confirmed that the device was non-explosive, custody of Morley was returned to the Topsfield police. \n \n Topsfield police sent out a Nixle alert to subscribing residents at 7:36 a.m. on Sunday saying that Washington and Main streets were closed due to a public safety emergency. Police sent out another alert at 9:30 a.m. saying the roads were reopened. \n \n Morley was taken to Bridgewater State Hospital on Sunday night and was scheduled for arraignment on Monday at Ipswich District Court in Newburyport as long as his health permits. \n \n The case remains under investigation and additional charges may be forthcoming.",

    "document": "Martin Tripp. Business Insider \n \n Martin Tripp, a former process technician at Tesla who says he made $28 an hour, filed a countersuit against the company on Tuesday. \n \n Tripp, 40, alleges that Tesla is not living up to its mission to improve the environment and instead is generating \"large quantities of waste and 'scrap' vehicle parts lying haphazardly on the ground inside the Gigafactory,\" according to the counterclaim. \n \n Tripp also alleges that Tesla consistently reused battery parts that had been discarded as waste. His filing says he \"was even told by one colleague that the colleague, after seeing damaged products being reused, intentionally further damaged the parts to prevent them from being used in a Model 3.\" \n \n More allegations from Tripp's counterclaim: \n \n \"In mid-May 2018, [Tesla's] Manufacturing Operating System ('MOS') showed that from January 1, 2018 to mid-May 2018, approximately $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 worth of battery module parts, including bandoliers and battery cells, had been categorized as 'Scrap.'\" \n \n Tripp also claims that punctured battery cells were reworked with glue and put back on the manufacturing line: \"Based upon information and belief, no quality inspections were performed on these 'reworked' battery modules before they were returned to the manufacturing processing line. Mr. Tripp personally observed technicians perform this process on several battery modules.\" \n \n Tripp claims that Tesla discontinued systems to track vehicle parts: \"As a result, traceability is unknown for many vehicle-parts and/or materials which could have a drastic effect on determining where the part(s) were made, when, and by whom.\" \n \n Tripp denies allegations that he hacked into Tesla's manufacturing operating system. \n \n Tripp claims Tesla \"published these false and defamatory statements out of malice and to retaliate against\" him and \"discredit him before the general public.\" \n \n Earlier, Tripp leaked internal documents and other information to Business Insider. \n \n A self-proclaimed former Tesla fanboy, Tripp claims that he tried bringing his concerns to his superiors and to Tesla CEO Elon Musk first but that nothing came of it. \n \n Now Tripp is being sued by Tesla, which accuses him of hacking the company and transferring secret information to third parties. \n \n Tesla also claimed it received a tip from a \"friend\" of Tripp who suggested Tripp might try to \"shoot up\" the Gigafactory. Law enforcement looked into it at the time and found no credible threat. \n \n Tripp denies any violent intentions in his counterclaim and says Tesla declined to reveal the name of the \"friend\" who gave it the tip. \n \n \"Tesla has used strong-arm tactics and a defamatory smear campaign in an effort to bury the disconcerting information Martin Tripp learned as a Tesla employee and to discredit Mr. Tripp before the general public,\" Tripp's attorney, Robert D. Mitchell of Tiffany and Bosco, said in a statement to Business Insider. \n \n \"By filing its lawsuit against Mr. Tripp, Tesla has now forced the issues to the forefront, and Mr. Tripp looks forward to defending himself before a jury of his peers by showing that what he witnessed and repeatedly reported at Tesla is, in fact, true.\" \n \n Tesla did not respond to requests for comment for this story. \n \n What may happen when Tesla wants to sue you \n \n Tripp's legal troubles with Tesla began on June 14 and 15, when the company's security team called him into meetings for questioning. \n \n He tells Business Insider the first meeting lasted about six or seven hours. Tripp claims Tesla's team wanted to know how he allegedly ran queries into its manufacturing operating system, such as about Tesla's scrap waste and part prices, and why he'd do that. \n \n Tripp says he told Tesla that he felt Musk was misleading investors about production numbers and that Tesla's security personnel laughed in response. \n \n Tripp says he then took Tesla's team to an area where nonconforming battery parts were lying about. Some of those batteries were destined for rework, and he explained his fears about hurriedly reworked batteries going into \"thermal runaway,\" a condition in which an overheating battery begins to destroy itself. \n \n Tripp says he was eventually escorted out by security, at which point, he says, he found his car surrounded by further security in the Tesla parking lot. \n \n Tesla security wouldn't leave until a truck came to escort Tripp out, he claims. The incident left him with the impression that he'd been let go from the company. \n \n He was not. \n \n The next day, Tripp says, Tesla's security team called him back for more questioning and then put him on \"administrative leave.\" \n \n Tripp recalls the second meeting with Tesla being shorter and less cordial than the first. Tesla's team asked similar questions and then started to ask stranger ones, Tripp claims. They wanted to know how he had allegedly managed to put a program into the MOS that ran queries into the system at the same time every day, searching for scrap costs. \n \n According to Tripp, the security team told him it knew he had logged into nine computers and had the program running from three of them. \n \n Tesla did not respond to request for comment on the meetings. In Tesla's complaint, Tesla alleges that in the meetings, Tripp admitted to writing software that hacked Tesla's MOS and to transferring \"several gigabytes of confidential and proprietary Tesla data...\" Tripp denies these accusations in his filing. He told Business Insider he didn't even know how to code. \n \n \"This ordeal, which, inter alia, implied that Mr. Tripp was a danger to those around him, was highly embarrassing and distressing to Mr. Tripp,\" Tripp claims in the filing. \n \n Later, Musk wrote in a company-wide email that Tesla had a \"saboteur\" on its hands. Shortly after that, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Tripp. \n \n In a now-public email exchange between Tripp and Musk, the Tesla CEO called Tripp a \"horrible human being.\" \n \n The company alleges that Tripp stole confidential data and exaggerated the numbers in that data to the media. Tesla also alleged that Tripp hacked into its MOS. \n \n Tripp says his safety was jeopardized in the weeks that followed. \n \n The counterclaim alleges that Tripp \"has received numerous threats to his personal safety, which, upon information and belief, have been stirred by the foregoing false and defamatory statements published about him\" by Tesla. It continues: \"Mr. Tripp has even been followed and trailed on multiple occasions by unidentified individuals.\" \n \n Claims and rumors \n \n Rumors have flown around Tesla's factories about Tripp and the \"saboteur.\" \n \n An engineer at the Fremont, California, factory told Business Insider that the engineers thought it was crazy that any such \"saboteur\" could exist at all. In their opinion, this person would have to have been a professional hacker. \n \n \"The MOS configuration ... gets overwritten daily with an automatic push from a stash repository,\" the person said. \"All changes on said stash are trackable and require approval from other members.\" \n \n He added: \"Pushing malicious software onto other people's computers would not be possible without their authorization unless [the person were] a professional hacker. To which then I would say, 'Why is [Tripp] working as a process technician?'\" \n \n In his counterclaim, Tripp maintains that the information he sent to Business Insider was accurate. \n \n All of this comes at a critical time for Tesla. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say the company may have to raise money soon to maintain a comfortable cash position as it tries to scale its new Model 3 sedan amid production delays. \n \n The company reports its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. \n \n If you are a Tesla employee or customer who has a story to share about a car or experience with the company, give me a shout at llopez@businessinsider.com. \n \n Disclaimer: The author of this article is specifically named in the counterclaim, where Tripp alleges that statements Musk made on Twitter to @lopezlinette are false and defamatory. ||||| The Tesla \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who was accused of sabotage has filed a counterclaim against Tesla and Elon Musk, arguing that his former employer defamed him when it told media outlets that he had threatened a mass shooting. \n \n Martin Tripp, a former technician at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Nevada, was sued by the electric car company on 20 June, just days after Musk had sent a company email stating that an employee had engaged in \u201cquite extensive and damaging sabotage\u201d against the company\u2019s computer systems. \n \n The lawsuit accused Tripp of hacking, theft, and making false claims to the media about punctured battery cells and excess scrap material. \n \n Tripp fought back, telling reporters that he was not a saboteur, but a whistleblower who had leaked information to a reporter for Business Insider out of environmental and safety concerns. \n \n In response to Tripp\u2019s claim to be a whistleblower, Musk told the Guardian by email on the evening of 20 June that Tesla had \u201creceived a call at the Gigafactory that he was going to come back and shoot people\u201d. \n \n Elon Musk: the volatile visionary at risk of steering Tesla off the road Read more \n \n The Guardian did not publish the allegation, but other media outlets did, based on an official statement from a company spokesperson stating that the call came \u201cfrom a friend of Mr Tripp\u201d. The local sheriff\u2019s department announced that \u201cthere was no credible threat\u201d the next day. \n \n Earlier this month, Musk faced significant backlash after he baselessly accused one of the British cave divers involved in the rescue of 12 Thai children of being a \u201cpedo\u201d. The diver said he was considering legal action, and Musk eventually apologized. \n \n William Fischbach, one of the attorneys representing Tripp, said Tuesday: \u201cTesla has made several false and defamatory statements about Mr Tripp in an effort to discredit him before the general public.\u201d \n \n Another attorney for Tripp, Robert D Mitchell, added: \u201cThere were very suspicious, very contradictory stories that were advanced by Tesla. We\u2019re going to be interested in getting to the bottom of how the story was concocted.\u201d \n \n Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously challenged the accuracy of Tripp\u2019s claims. \n \n \n \n The counterclaim, filed in federal court in Nevada on Tuesday, reasserts claims that Tripp had made to Business Insider about his concerns over \u201chigh levels of waste and scrap\u201d, \u201cunnerving, dangerous and wasteful business practices\u201d and \u201cpunctured battery modules\u201d. \n \n The countersuit also alleges that Tesla never received any phone call from \u201ca friend of Mr Tripp\u201d and argues that even if the company had received such a call, it acted \u201cwith at least negligence\u201d by failing to \u201cconduct a reasonable investigation\u201d prior to publicizing the information. \n \n The suit further alleges various problems with Tesla\u2019s behavior on the night of the alleged shooting threat, stating that Tesla had \u201cprovided inconsistent responses\u201d to law enforcement when asked whether the caller was male or female; that Tesla \u201cprovided false information\u201d to law enforcement when it claimed to be able to \u201cverify\u201d that Tripp was \u201carmed\u201d; and that Tesla \u201cappeared to know exactly where Mr Tripp was located\u201d during the course of the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s investigation, telling investigators that \u201clittle birds sing\u201d. \n \n \n \n Mitchell and Fischbach declined to comment on the source of their information about Tesla\u2019s statements to investigators, but they said they had confidence in their evidence. \n \n The suit also addresses a series of tweets that Musk sent about the Business Insider reporter, Linette Lopez, to whom Tripp had leaked information. \n \n Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue? \n \n The countersuit claims that the tweet \u201cfalsely implies that Mr Tripp accepted a bribe from Ms Lopez in exchange for providing information\u201d, which Tripp denies. \n \n Tripp is seeking at least $1m and punitive damages for claims of defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. \n \n The countersuit comes at a sensitive time for Tesla, which is under intense pressure from investors to prove that it can mass-produce its electric vehicles and turn a profit. \n \n Tesla will announce its quarterly financial results Wednesday. ||||| Martin Tripp, an ex-Tesla technician the company has accused of hacking and sabotage, has now countersued his former employer and claimed that Tesla defamed him. \n \n Since Tesla fired Tripp and sued him more than a month ago for alleged trade secrets theft, he has hired a New York attorney to help him file a formal whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n \n CEO Elon Musk has suggested that there could be tens of \"bad apples\" who have also committed \"sabotage\" against the company in an apparent effort to thwart Tesla's ambitious promised ramp-up to produce 5,000 Model 3s per week. In recent months the company mounted an unusual tent-like apparatus known as a Sprung structure that houses a new assembly line as part of its factory in Fremont, California. \n \n However, to date, Tesla has not brought any cases against any further alleged saboteurs. \n \n In a new lawsuit filed Tuesday by his new Arizona-based legal team, Tripp more fully explained his concerns. \n \n A long, dusty road \n \n Tripp previously worked at the Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, which manufactures Tesla\u2019s batteries. \n \n There, he \"observed that the waste and scrap levels and non-conforming materials generated by Counterdefendant dramatically increased\" after the March 2018 so-called \"March to 2,500.\" The \"March to 2,500\" referred to Tesla's goal of ramping up to 2,500 Model 3s and then 5,000 by July 2018. \n \n The lawsuit goes on to explain that Tripp \"raised his concerns about the seemingly exorbitant amounts of scrap with his managers and supervisors but no action was taken.\" On May 16, 2018, he went so far as to email Musk himself and included supporting \"graphical charts,\" in anticipation of Musk\u2019s visit to the Gigafactory. \n \n As the civil complaint continues: \n \n Later in the afternoon on May 16, 2018, Mr. Tripp's Manufacturing Engineer Manager asked Mr. Tripp to \"forward\" him the \"email to Elon so that I can avoid getting fired tonight.\" After Mr. Tripp asked why the Manufacturing Engineer Manager would get fired, the Manufacturing Engineer Manager explained: \"because I'm the guy showing him the line and our problems like yield, the guy standing in front of him is the guy who gets fired, and tonight I\u2019m the guy in front of him.\" That same day, a Design Engineer asked Mr. Tripp to \"clean up\" the stator production line area so Mr. Musk would not see the mounds of scrap and waste lying on the ground. Mr. Tripp declined to do so because he had repeatedly complained to his supervisors about that very issue over the course of several months, but his complaints had been ignored. Mr. Tripp wanted Mr. Musk to observe how the Gigafactory was actually being operated. The next day, May 17, 2018, Mr. Tripp was \"reassigned\" to the battery module production line. \u2026 Perhaps most egregiously, Mr. Tripp was told by multiple process technicians and associates that a \"teach pin\" had been left on a robot used in the manufacturing process of battery modules, causing damage to the battery modules. Mr. Tripp was told by the process technicians and associates that when the robot had picked up a battery module, the teach pin, which had become \"unthreaded\" and \"longer,\" struck the clamshell (i.e., the outer plastic coating) of the battery module, causing a dent and/or puncture. Mr. Tripp was further told that, eventually, the teach pin began puncturing the actual battery cells within the battery module. Approximately 1,173 battery modules had been damaged by this process. \n \n For its part, Tesla has strongly denied that any such damaged batteries made it into any Model 3. The company has previously said in a statement that \"Tripp is either not telling the truth or he simply has no idea what he is talking about.\" \n \n Bye, bye, birdie? \n \n In yet another bizarre turn in this twisted tale, in the immediate wake of the June 2018 lawsuit filed against Tripp, a woman at the Gigafactory said she received a call from an anonymous caller claiming that Tripp had threatened to \"shoot the place up.\" \n \n Tripp previously categorically denied making any such statement to Ars, which prompted a visit by the Storey County Sheriff. The local authorities ultimately determined that there was \"no credible threat.\" \n \n Even if Tesla did receive such a call, according to the lawsuit, Tesla \"did not, based upon information and belief, conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether the purported caller was actually a 'friend of Mr. Tripp' before making the foregoing false and defamatory publication, such as obtaining the name of the caller or ascertaining how the caller knew Mr. Tripp.\" \n \n This, Tripp\u2019s lawyers argue, constitutes \"at least negligence.\" \n \n Even more strangely, the lawsuit continues, during the sheriff's investigation, Tesla \"appeared to know exactly where Mr. Tripp was located the majority of the time and, after being asked by the investigating deputies how it was aware of such information, [Tesla] simply replied \u2018little birds sing.\u2019\" \n \n Tesla did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment.",

It further notes Tesla seemed to know Tripp's location during the law enforcement investigation and \"provided false information\" to authorities when claiming it could \"verify\" the 40-year-old was \"armed.\" \"We're \u2026 interested in getting to the bottom of how the story was concocted,\" a lawyer for Tripp tells the Guardian. Tripp, who denies Tesla's claim that he wrote software used to lift data from factory computers (he says he can't even code), is seeking at least $1 million plus punitive damages for alleged defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. His lawsuit notes he's received \"numerous threats\" to his safety.",

Martin Tripp, a 40-year-old former process technician who says he made $28 an hour, alleges that between January and May of this year, \"approximately $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 worth of battery module parts, including bandoliers and battery cells, had been categorized as 'Scrap.'\" Tripp's filing says he was even told by a colleague that the parts were intentionally damaged to prevent them from being used in a Model 3. Tesla is suing Tripp for allegedly hacking its manufacturing operating system and transferring secret information to third parties. Tesla also claims it received a tip from a \"friend\" of Tripp who suggested Tripp might try to \"shoot up\" the Giga factory. Tripp denies any violent intentions and says Tesla \"has used strong-arm tactics and a defamatory smear campaign in an effort to bury the disconcerting information Martin Tripp learned as a Tesla employee and to discredit Mr. Tripp before the general public.\" Tripp says Tesla's security personnel laughed when he told them he felt Elon Musk was misleading investors about production numbers. Tripp says he tried bringing his concerns \u2013 A former Tesla employee is suing the company after CEO Elon Musk called him a \"horrible human being\" and accused him of hacking into the company's computer system, Business Insider reports. According to Business Insider, Jason Tripp worked as a \"process technician\" at a Tesla plant in Fremont, Calif., where he was responsible for checking batteries for safety issues. In a lawsuit filed in California Superior Court, Tripp claims he was fired after he raised concerns about overheating batteries with other Tesla employees. Tripp says Tesla employees wouldn't leave until a truck arrived to escort him out of the parking lot. Tesla filed a lawsuit of its own against Tripp, claiming he hacked into its computer system and stole confidential data. Musk called Tripp a \"saboteur\" in an email exchange. Tripp countersued Tesla, saying the company published \"false and defamatory statements\" about him that threatened his personal safety. Tesla's lawsuit claims Tripp admitted to hacking its computer and transferring \"several gigabytes of confidential and proprietary Tesla data.\" Tripp says in his counterclaim that he didn't even know how to code and that his ordeal at Tesla was \"highly embarrassing and distressing.\" Tesla hasn't responded to the lawsuit. \u2013 A whistleblower who was fired by Tesla after the company accused him of \"quite extensive and damaging sabotage\" has filed a countersuit against the company and Elon Musk, the Guardian reports. On June 20, Tesla sued Martin Tripp, accusing him of hacking, theft, and making false claims to the media about punctured battery cells and excess scrap material. Musk responded to Tripp's claims by telling the Guardian that Tesla had \"received a call at the Gigafactory that he was going to come back and shoot people.\" The local sheriff's department said there was no credible threat at the time, and Musk tweeted about Business Insider reporter Linette Lopez, who had interviewed Tripp. On Tuesday, Tripp countersued Tesla for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming the company made \"false and defamatory statements about Mr. Tripp in an effort to discredit him before the general public.\" Tripp is seeking at least $1 million in damages. \u2013 A fired Tesla technician has countersued the company, claiming it defamed him. The Guardian reports Martin Tripp, who was fired last month for allegedly stealing trade secrets, filed a lawsuit against Tesla on Tuesday. The company had accused Tripp of hacking its Nevada Gigafactory, where he worked, and damaging more than a thousand battery modules. But in his lawsuit, Tripp says the company ignored his complaints about \"seemingly exorbitant amounts of scrap\" and \"non-conforming materials.\" Tripp says Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, knew about the waste and materials issues and fired him \"because I'm the guy showing him the line and our problems like yield, the guy standing in front of him is the guy who gets fired, and tonight I'll be the guy with him.\" Tripp is seeking at least $1 million in damages for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
