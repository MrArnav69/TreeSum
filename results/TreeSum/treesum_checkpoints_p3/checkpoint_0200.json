    "document": "Image caption Researchers were surprised to see liquid water coming up through the drill hole as temperatures were below freezing \n \n Researchers say they have discovered a large reservoir of melt water that sits under the Greenland ice sheet all year round. \n \n The scientists say the water is stored in the air space between particles of ice, similar to the way that fruit juice stays liquid in a slush drink. \n \n The aquifer, which covers an area the size of Ireland, could yield important clues to sea level rise. \n \n The research is published in the journal, Nature Geoscience. \n \n The melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been a significant contributor to a rise in sea levels over the past 100 years. \n \n The water is stored in the air space between the ice particles, like the juice in a snow cone Prof Rick Forster, University of Utah \n \n According to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the ice sheet lost 34 billion tonnes of ice per year between 1992 and 2001 - but this increased to 215 billion tonnes between 2002 and 2011 \n \n Scientists still have many unanswered questions about the direction and speed and ultimate destination of this melted water. \n \n Ice free liquid \n \n This new research finds that a significant amount is stored in partially compacted snow called firn. \n \n In the spring of 2011, researchers drilled deep into this slushy layer and to their surprise, found liquid water flowing back to the surface even though air temperatures were -15 degrees C. \n \n As this was well before the onset of the summer melt, the team concluded the water had persisted in a liquid state through the Greenland winter. \n \n \"This discovery was a surprise,\" said Prof Rick Forster from the University of Utah. \n \n \"Instead of the water being stored in the air space between subsurface rock particles, the water is stored in the air space between the ice particles, like the juice in a snow cone.\" \n \n The scientists have also come up with a rough estimate for the amount of water that is contained in the aquifer which itself covers an area of 70,000 sq km. \n \n Image caption The researchers drilled in areas with large accumulations of snow on the surface \n \n They believe that it holds roughly 140 billion tonnes of water, which is the equivalent to 0.4mm of sea level rise per year - about half of what Greenland contributes to the sea every year. \n \n But crucially the scientists don't know the ultimate destination of the water in the reservoir. \n \n \"It depends on whether it is currently connected to a system that is draining into the ocean or if it is a bit isolated and completely acting as a storage source without a current connection,\" said Prof Forster. \n \n \"We don't know the answer to this right now. It's massive, it's a new system we haven't seen before - we need to understand it more completely if we are to predict sea level rise.\" \n \n The scientists say the water is prevented from freezing by the large amounts of snow that fall on the surface of the ice sheet late in the summer. \n \n This insulates the water from the air temperatures which are below freezing, allowing the water to persist as liquid all year long. \n \n Other researchers believe this discovery may help explain disparities between projections of mass loss by climate models and observations from satellites. \n \n \"The large mass of liquid water in firn also represents a heat sink that could be playing a role in Greenland's interaction with the climate system,\" wrote Dr Joel Harper from the University of Montana, in a comment piece published alongside the study. \n \n \"As the intensity of surface melt in Greenland increases and expands upwards to the higher elevations that are covered by firn, liquid water storage may play an expanding role in the ice sheet's future response to climate change.\" \n \n Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc. ||||| A drill rig was used to extract old snow (firn) cores from within the Greenland snow aquifer. \n \n Big surprises still hide beneath the frozen surface of snowy Greenland. Despite decades of poking and prodding by scientists, only now has the massive ice island revealed a hidden aquifer. \n \n In southeast Greenland, more than 100 billion tons of liquid water soaks a slushy snow layer buried anywhere from 15 to 160 feet (5 to 50 meters) below the surface. This snow aquifer covers more than 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometers) \u2014 an area bigger than West Virginia \u2014 researchers report today (Dec. 22) in the journal Nature Geoscience. \n \n \"We thought we had an understanding of how things work in Greenland, but here is this entire storage system of water we didn't realize was there,\" said Richard Forster, lead study author and a glaciologist at the University of Utah. \n \n The discovery will help scientists better understand the fate of Greenland's annual surface melt, which contributes to sea level rise. When the summer sun warms the Arctic island, a giant water world of stunning blue lakes and streams appears atop the ice. Tracking this surface runoff helps scientists account for ice lost to melting each year. Until now, researchers thought most of this water went to the ocean or refroze on the ice. Now they've found a new hiding place. \n \n \"This throws an additional complexity into the system,\" Forster told LiveScience. \n \n There is enough water in the snow aquifer to raise global sea level by 0.015 inches (0.4 millimeters), according to a separate study by the same team published Nov. 30 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters (GRL). Every year, Greenland adds 0.03 inches (0.7 mm) of water to global sea level rise from melting snow and ice, Forster said. [Top 10 Surprising Results of Global Warming] \n \n Where water flows \n \n No one yet knows how old the water in the aquifer is, and whether it stays trapped in the snow or reaches the ocean in slow streams or catastrophic floods. However, the top of the water table rose after Greenland's huge surface melt in 2012, the researchers report in their GRL study. \n \n Water from the Greenland snow aquifer draining from a drill core extracted 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface of the ice sheet in April, before the summer surface melt, with air temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius). Credit: Ludovic Brucker \n \n The group will return to southeast Greenland in the coming years to answer these and other questions, Forster said. \"Just seeing how old it is would answer a lot of questions,\" he said. \n \n The final destination of Greenland's melt water is also key to understanding how the ice sheet ebbs and flows, because water under the ice sheet lubricates flowing glaciers. Researchers know some melt water goes to the bottom of the ice, trickling through cracks and racing through vertical pipes called moulins. Some of the water also simply refreezes on the surface when winter comes. Liquid water sitting in buried snow layers can also slowly warm and melt the ice sheet. \n \n \"The existence of this rather flavorless natural snow cone has many implications for the future of the ice sheet, some that may make the ice go away faster and others that help keep the ice a little longer,\" said Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study. \"We would like to understand these implications better so we can help reduce the uncertainties about future changes.\" \n \n Soppy surprise \n \n Forster and his colleagues discovered the aquifer in 2011, when a drill punched into sopping wet snow, as mushy as a summer snow cone treat or a Slurpee. (This was a year before the big surface melt of 2012.) \"Water was pouring out of the core,\" Forster said \u2014 not what one wants to find when all the electronics are mounted outside the drill. A video of the event reveals both excitement and a few choice words among the scientists. [Watch: Discover Greenland's Hidden Aquifer] \n \n The water was stored in hard, compacted snow called firn \u2014 the remains of the previous year's snowfall. Forster thinks the aquifer went undiscovered because so much snow falls in this corner of Greenland. \n \n In Southeast Greenland, frequent storms crash into tall mountains, dumping more winter snow there than anywhere else on the icy island. The thick, insulating snow blanket keeps the watery firn liquid during the freezing winter, like a down coverlet, Forster said. \n \n Many drillers have skipped over this part of Greenland because the snow layers are so thick, Forster said, and most people who are drilling cylinders of ice from the ice sheet are looking to see the layers compacted over hundreds and thousands of years. \"People who extract ice cores don't want to go through high accumulation layers,\" he said. But Forster's team was interested in the past 10 years of snowfall, so the southeast was a good research spot, he said. \n \n Ground-penetrating radar, towed by snowmobile, helped the researchers locate more water nearby, which the group confirmed by drilling in 2011 and 2013. When the researchers returned home, they searched airborne radar data from NASA's Operation IceBridge and discovered the true extent of the buried snow aquifer, all in areas with heavy snowfall. Most of the water is in the southeast, but a few pockets appeared in the south and southwest, Forster said. \"It all corresponds to these areas of high snow accumulation,\" he said. \n \n Greenland's future \n \n Researchers estimate Greenland has lost more than 200 million tons of ice and snow each year since 2003. The ice sheet will completely disappear when the planet's average temperature rises by 2 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 4 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial temperatures, as predicted by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in September. \n \n Earth's surface temperatures are already up 1.3 F (0.7 C) from preindustrial temperatures, with average temperatures rising faster in Greenland. \n \n \"This doesn't change our knowledge that too much carbon dioxide in the air will melt Greenland's ice, but it will help us make better estimates of how much and how fast,\" Alley said. \n \n Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 As far as discoveries go, this one is literally huge: An aquifer holding more than 100 billion tons of water that covers an area larger than West Virginia has been discovered beneath Greenland's snow-covered ice sheet. And it caught the researchers who stumbled on it in 2011 off-guard, with lead study author Richard Forster telling LiveScience, \"We thought we had an understanding of how things work in Greenland, but here is this entire storage system of water we didn't realize was there.\" As for the \"where,\" the aquifer was identified in the southeast part of the country, ranging from 15 to 160 feet beneath the surface, whose snow acts as an insulator, keeping the water liquid year-round. Forster gives this great description of how the water is stored, per the BBC: \"in the air space between the ice particles, like the juice in a snow cone.\" But the find has raised plenty of questions, like: How old is the water? Does it stay where it is, or trickle to the sea ... or rush toward the sea in a flood? In a separate study, the team determined that if released, the aquifer's water could push global sea levels up 0.015 inches. And in terms of sea level rise, LiveScience explains that scientists have long assumed that most of the water produced in the country's annual surface melt streams toward the ocean, or eventually refroze; the aquifer is essentially a \"new hiding place,\" one that researchers can study to get a better grasp on the annual melt. Says Forster, \"We need to understand it more completely if we are to predict sea level rise.\"",

    "document": "Hilary Rosen, a Democratic operative with SKD Knickerbocker, touched off a Twitter storm tonight after she went on CNN and said that Ann Romney has \"never worked a day in her life.\" \n \n The statement was tweeted and retweeted, with a number of people condemning the statement as an attack on the candidate's wife, who was a stay-at-home mom who also raised the couple's five boys, and who has suffered from MS and breast cancer. \n \n Ann Romney, who is widely praised as her husband's most effective surrogate, took to Twitter herself for her first-ever post, saying, \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.\" \n \n (See also: 10 things about Hillary Rosen) \n \n A number of people leapt to her defense, and President Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina and top adviser David Axelrod tweeted out disavowals of a statement that seemed insensitive to stay-at-home moms and sounded like a devaluation of what Ann Romney's life was like. \n \n \u201cI could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize,\u201d Messina tweeted. \n \n \"Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney. They were inappropriate and offensive,\" Axelrod tweeted. \n \n Rosen's firm also employs Anita Dunn, former White House communications director, and worked on the Obama campaign in 2008. Her critics on Twitter described her as an \"Obama adviser,\" just a bit of a stretch in description, but not enough of one for some critics, especially after Democrats have hit Republicans for guilt by association with people like Rush Limbaugh for months. \n \n Regardless, Rosen doubled down \u2014 tweeting back at Ann Romney, \"I am raising children too. But most young American women HAVE to BOTH earn a living AND raise children. You know that don't u?\" \n \n Earlier, she tweeted in her own defense, \"When I said @AC360 Ann Romney never worked I meant she never had to care for her kids AND earn a paycheck like MOST American women! # Truth\" \n \n And she went further in a Huffington Post blog item, saying Mitt Romney has to stop hiding behind his wife's \"skirt,\" and condemned the \"faux outrage\" from the right. \n \n Ann Romney, according to Dylan Byers, will be on Fox News tomorrow morning, giving the issue fresh life. And Ann Romney is known for giving strong interviews. Her husband is also guaranteed to be asked about it \u2014 and if the perception is she is being unfairly attacked, he will have won the cycle, and potentially many more to come. For Romney, who polls show facing a large gender gap with women and who has been trying to move away from social issues conversations, it could help him. \n \n The flip side is that Rosen's comments are now getting oxygen beyond the Twitterverse (and the CNN-verse), letting Democrats underscore, without doing much to push it out themselves, the notion that Ann Romney, whose husband was a success in business, may not have had a life similar to some swing voters' lives, despite how hard she worked raising her kids. \n \n Also worth noting \u2014 Messina's line that family should be \"off limits.\" Given the criticisms that Michele Obama has received over the years, it seems likely that Rosen's comment will be highlighted by Democrats if something comes up in the future. \n \n UPDATE: Rosen appears to have rewritten her Huffington Post blog post last night; the line about Romney hiding behind his wife's skirt is no longer there, and now the column mirrors one that ran on CNN's website. ||||| 7 years ago \n \n (CNN) - Democratic Strategist Hilary Rosen generated instant bipartisan criticism Wednesday night for her statement that Ann Romney has \"actually never worked a day in her life.\" \n \n The reaction on Twitter from high level politicos was instant and virtually unanimous: Rosen had gone too far. \n \n - Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker \n \n Rosen: Ann Romney and working moms \n \n Rosen's comment also prompted Ann Romney herself to make her twitter debut. \n \n \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys,\" Romney tweeted. \"Believe me, it was hard work.\" \n \n Rosen, also a CNN political contributor and a working mother, made her comments on CNN's \"AC360.\" \n \n \"What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country, saying, 'Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.' Guess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life,\" Rosen said. \n \n \"She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing, in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why do we worry about their future,\" Rosen continued, adding that Romney \"just seems so old fashioned when it comes to women.\" \n \n Her comments drew instant criticism on Twitter from campaign advisers on both sides of the aisle, as well as one of Romney's sons. \n \n Josh Romney posted that his mother \"is one of the smartest, hardest working woman I know. Could have done anything with her life, chose to raise me.\" \n \n The senior adviser to President Barack Obama's reelection bid also took to Twitter to distance the campaign from the comments. \n \n \"Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney,\" David Axelrod wrote. \"They were inappropriate and offensive.\" \n \n Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter posted, \"Families must be off limits on campaigns, and I personally believe stay at home moms work harder than most of us do.\" \n \n Several press aides to Romney's campaign - Andrea Saul, Ryan Williams, and Amanda Henneberg - posted links tying Obama to Rosen, such as her appointment as a DNC adviser and her appearance at a White House event. \n \n Romney campaign strategist Eric Fehrnstrom wrote: \"Obama adviser Hilary Rosen goes on #CNN to debut their new \"kill Ann\" strategy, and in the process insults hard-working moms.\" \n \n Eric Erickson, a CNN political contributor and editor of a conservative website, appeared on the same panel as Rosen, and tweeted, \"If raising 5 sons through breast cancer and MS isn't a real job, I'm not sure what is.\" \n \n The comment drew criticism from a Republican member of Congress, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, who posted, \"Wrong. Being a mom is a full-time job.\" \n \n Rosen explained her comments in a post on the social networking site. \n \n \"When I said @AC360 Ann Romney never worked I meant she never had to care for her kids AND earn a paycheck like MOST American women! #Truth,\" she wrote. \n \n She later posted a direct comment to Romney. \n \n \"Please know, I admire you. But your husband shouldn't say you are his expert on women and the economy.\" \n \n Also see: \n \n Romney on Santorum: 'This has been a good day for me' \n \n Louisiana governor endorses Romney \n \n Crossroads GPS to drop $1.7 million against Obama ||||| My Twitter feed was on fire after an appearance last night on CNN's AC360, where I said that I thought it was wrong for Mitt Romney to be using his wife as his guide to women's economic struggles when she \"had never worked a day in her life.\" Oh my, you should read the tweets and the hate mail I got after that. The accusations were flying. I don't know what it means to be a mom (I have 2 children). I obviously don't value the work that a mother does and how hard it is (the hardest job I have ever had); and I absolutely hate anyone who doesn't have the same views as I do (hate is a strong word). \n \n Spare me the faux anger from the right who view the issue of women's rights and advancement as a way to score political points. When it comes to supporting policies that would actually help women, their silence has been deafening. I don't need lectures from the RNC on supporting women and fighting to increase opportunities for women; I've been doing it my whole career. If they want to attack me and distract the public's attention away from their nominee's woeful record, it just demonstrates how much they just don't get it. \n \n My favorite tweet was from someone who said that Republicans like Ann Romney so much more than Mitt that by attacking her (which I didn't), I got people to defend him in a way they never would. \n \n That last one I can actually understand. \n \n Now let's be clear on one thing. I have no judgements about women who work outside the home vs. women who work in the home raising a family. I admire women who can stay home and raise their kids full-time. I even envy them sometimes. It is a wonderful luxury to have the choice. But let's stipulate that it is NOT a choice that most women have in America today. \n \n Why does this even matter? It matters purely because Mitt Romney put the issue of his wife's views squarely on the table. \n \n As Ruth Marcus noted in her column yesterday in the Washington Post, Romney, when asked last week about the gender gap, twice said he wished his wife could take the question. \n \n \"My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me,\" Romney told newspaper editors, \"and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy.\" \n \n So it begs the question, is Ann Romney Mitt's touchstone for women who are struggling economically or not? Nothing in Ann Romney's history as we have heard it -- hardworking mom she may have been -- leads me to believe that Mitt has chosen the right expert to get feedback on this problem he professes to be so concerned about. \n \n I have nothing against Ann Romney. She seems like a nice lady who has raised nice boys, struggled with illness, and handles its long-term effects with grace and dignity. I admire her grit in talking about her illness publicly. \n \n What is more important to me and 57% of current women voters is her husband saying he supports women's economic issue because they are the only issues that matter to us and then he fails on even those. \n \n Let's put aside for a moment his views on women's health issues -- such as his pledge to repeal funding for Planned Parenthood or repeal title X -- which provides important health services for poor women, and true anecdotes (such as when he was a Bishop in his church, he actually went to a congregant's hospital room and told a young single mother who had just given birth that she was shaming the church and should give her baby away). Let's put those issues of respect and health dignity away. \n \n Let's just focus on his economic record on behalf of women. When Romney ran Bain Capital, less than 10% of the senior workforce were women. And he said in his 1994 Senate race that it was because he had trouble finding qualified women to be executives. Is there a woman alive who believes that? I personally believe that women hate the way our health issues were made a political football by the Republicans in the last several months. But I am pragmatic enough to believe that the economic issues do matter greatly to women and men alike. But the only way that Mitt Romney will succeed in closing the wide gender gap between him and President Obama is if he stops pretending that it doesn't exist. \n \n Follow Hilary Rosen on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hilaryr",

I don't know what it means to be a mom (I have 2 children). ... Spare me the faux anger from the right who view the issue of women''s rights and advancement as a way to score political points. When it comes to supporting policies that would actually help women, their silence has been deafening.\" \"I have nothing against Ann Romney,\" writes Rosen. \"She seems like a nice lady who has raised nice boys, struggled with illness, and handles its long-term effects with grace and dignity. I admire her grit in talking about her illness publicly. What is more important to me and 57% of current women voters is her husband saying he supports women'S economic issue because they are the only issues that matter to us and then he fails on even those.\" The only way Mitt Romney will succeed in closing the gender gap between him and President Obama is if he stops pretending that it doesn't exist, she",

A little perspective: Typically, a kettle takes in about $30 an hour, according to the charity. \n \n The charity confirmed that the check cleared Monday but would not reveal the couple\u2019s identity. \u201cWe have been in touch with the donors, but they want to remain anonymous,\u201d Salvation Army spokeswoman Julie Borgen said. \u201cThis couple has supported the Army before with large checks in kettles, but never anything close to this level.\u201d \n \n Borgen said the bell ringers at the store, Rosemount firefighters, were oblivious to the big gift. But the Salvation Army\u2019s major-gifts manager was notified of the incoming windfall a day or two in advance, she said, and picked up the kettle himself. The couple have given advance notice for their previous gifts as well, Borgen said, though she didn\u2019t know how many years they\u2019d given. \n \n The couple said they made the gift in hopes of encouraging others to also stretch their generosity and to honor one of their fathers, who served in the trenches in World War I and was grateful to the Salvation Army \u201cdoughnut lassies\u201d who brought soldiers free coffee and doughnuts. \n \n The holiday season is underway with the appearance of the Salvation Army donation kettles and bell ringers. \n \n They said they were also inspired by memories from years ago of relying on discarded food from a grocery store to make ends meet. \n \n \u201cYou get to a point in life where it\u2019s time to take care of others, the way you were taken care of,\u201d the donors said in a statement issued through the charity. \n \n Maj.

The charity has raised about $2.2 million so far, comparable to this time last year. \n \n \u201cWe invite everyone to please give what they can,\u201d Strickler said. \u201cEvery dollar counts, and we only have 30 days left to meet our goal.\u201d \n \n There is no indication, spokeswoman Borgen said, that the couple are behind the anonymous \u201cSt. Grand\u201d donations that red kettles in the Twin Cities have been receiving in roughly $1,000 increments for the past five years. \n \n \u201cWe truly don\u2019t know who St. Grand is,\u201d Borgen said. \n \n St. Grand, whether one person or more than one, slipped $1,100 each into two kettles Friday in Roseville, one drop at a Lunds & Byerlys on County Road C and the other at Cub Foods on Larpenteur Avenue, according to the Salvation Army. The scenario repeated itself Saturday: same amounts, same locations. For the math-impaired, that\u2019s $4,400. \n \n The Salvation Army is seeking bell-ringer volunteers to sign up for one of 575 kettle locations online at salvationarmynorth.org. The charity is one of the largest providers of Christmas toys in the metro area, providing gifts for about 15,000 children.

Layden says they\u2019re investigating right now, to identify a common product, that could link all the cases. ||||| State and local health officials have issued a warning about a synthetic pot in Illinois that has caused users to experience severe bleeding. \n \n On Friday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported that 32 people in the past few weeks visited emergency rooms with severe bleeding after using a synthetic cannabinoid product. That\u2019s up from the 22 cases the state reported just the day before. \n \n The department also released a geographic breakdown, reporting eight cases in Chicago, four in suburban Cook County and one each in Will, DuPage, Kane and McLean counties. The hot spot seems to be the Peoria area, with Tazewell County reporting 10 cases and neighboring Peoria County six. \n \n Most of those affected were in the Chicago area, but health officials warned the contaminated products also could be present elsewhere across the state, said department spokeswoman Melaney Arnold. \n \n The health department said Thursday that symptoms have included bleeding from the eyes and ears. On Friday, officials clarified that while this can happen, those affected in Illinois have reported other symptoms, like coughing up blood, blood in urine, bloody noses, bleeding gums and, for women, heavier than usual menstrual flow. \n \n Though synthetic pot has long been considered dangerous, severe bleeding is not a known side effect, said Dr. Melissa Millewich, an emergency room physician at Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove. \n \n \u201cThis bleeding is not expected, at least in such a significant population so quickly,\u201d she said. \n \n Despite a statewide ban, Arnold said manufacturers could be slightly tweaking the molecular makeup of the products as a way to \u201cget around\u201d the law, allowing for them to be sold legally. They are also sold on the street, she said, and those experiencing the bleeding said they obtained the products in convenience stores and from dealers and friends. \n \n Health officials reported 32 people who experienced the symptom since March 7, and they continue to track the situation, Arnold said. So far, there are no deaths reported. \n \n A change in the latest formula could be behind the new, dangerous symptom, Millewich said. Because health officials don\u2019t know the exact makeup of the products, it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s causing the bleeding, she added. \n \n While there have been no such cases at Good Samaritan\u2019s ER, Millewich said, synthetic pot, often called \u201cfake weed,\u201d \u201cK2\u201d or \u201cspice,\u201d has previously displayed life-threatening symptoms like kidney failure, along with psychosis. \n \n \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how dangerous this is,\u201d she said. \n \n The man-made substance is a mixture of hundreds of chemicals, often called cannabinoids because they affect the same brain cell receptors as the main ingredient in marijuana. Cannabinoids are sometimes sprayed on plant material for smoking, or are sold as liquids to be vaporized and inhaled in e-cigarettes and other devices, the health department\u2019s warning said. The products are also sometimes referred to as herbal or liquid incense. \n \n Recent patient reports of severe bleeding led health officials to warn the public not to use any synthetic cannabinoid products. \n \n While those affected by the outbreak admitted using cannabinoids, it\u2019s been difficult to determine their exact source for the substance, Arnold said. \n \n Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the public health department, says there\u2019s an erroneous perception that synthetic cannabinoids are a safe and legal alternative to marijuana. \n \n Shah says they're unsafe because it's difficult to know what chemicals they contain or what an individual's reaction will be. \n \n A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found there\u2019s also an association between teens who use synthetic pot and a heightened risk for violent behavior, risky sex and abuse of other drugs. \n \n Anyone who uses these drugs and experiences unexplained bleeding or bruising is advised to call 911 or have someone take them to an emergency room. \n \n Associated Press contributed. \n \n kthayer@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @knthayer",

A judge is expected to... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to immediately return the White House press credentials of CNN reporter Jim Acosta. \n \n U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, an appointee of President Donald Trump, announced his decision following a hearing in Washington. The judge said Acosta's credentials would be returned immediately and reactivated to allow him access to the White House. \n \n CNN had asked the judge to force the White House to immediately hand back the credentials that give Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, access to the White House complex for press briefings and other events. CNN asked for Acosta's credentials restored while a lawsuit over his credentials' revocation goes forward. \n \n The judge granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order. A lawsuit that CNN brought against the Trump administration over the issue is continuing. \n \n The White House revoked Acosta's credentials after he and Trump tangled during a press conference last week. \n \n The judge said the government could not say who initially decided to revoke Acosta's hard pass. The White House had spelled out its reasons for revoking his credentials in a tweet from White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and in a statement after CNN filed its lawsuit. But the judge said those \"belated efforts were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process.\" \n \n The judge also found that Acosta suffered \"irreparable harm,\" dismissing the government's argument that CNN could just send other reporters to cover the White House in Acosta's place. \n \n The judge told attorneys to file additional court papers in the case by Monday. \n \n Trump has made his dislike of CNN clear since before he took office and continuing into his presidency. He has described the network as \"fake news\" both on Twitter and in public comments. \n \n At last week's press conference, which followed the midterm elections, Trump was taking questions from reporters and called on Acosta, who asked about Trump's statements about a caravan of migrants making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. After a terse exchange, Trump told Acosta, \"That's enough,\" several times while calling on another reporter. \n \n Acosta attempted to ask another question about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and initially declined to give up a hand-held microphone to a White House intern. Trump responded to Acosta by saying he wasn't concerned about the investigation, calling it a \"hoax,\" and then criticized Acosta, calling him a \"rude, terrible person.\" \n \n The White House pulled Acosta's credentials hours later. \n \n The White House's explanations for why it seized Acosta's credentials have shifted over the last week. \n \n Sanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone. \n \n But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the microphone, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was. On Tuesday, Sanders accused Acosta of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference. ||||| A federal judge on Friday ruled in favor of CNN and reporter Jim Acosta in a dispute with President Trump, ordering the White House to temporarily restore the press credentials that the administration had taken away from Acosta last week. \n \n In a victory for the cable network and for press access generally, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly granted CNN\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order that will prevent the administration from keeping Acosta off the White House grounds. \n \n The White House revoked the reporter\u2019s press pass last week after a heated exchange between him and Trump and a brief altercation with a press aide at a news conference. Acosta, CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, is the first reporter with a \u201chard pass\u201d granting White House access to be banned. \n \n CNN sued Trump and other White House officials Tuesday over the revocation. Kelly\u2019s ruling was the result of the first legal skirmish in that lawsuit. It has the immediate effect of sending Acosta back to the White House, pending further arguments and a possible trial. The litigation is in its early stages, and a trial could be months away. \n \n Hours after the judge\u2019s decision, Acosta resumed his post at the White House. \n \n Kelly, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench last year, handed down his ruling two days after the network and government lawyers argued over whether the president had the power to revoke a reporter\u2019s access. \n \n \n \n President Trump and CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta square off at a Nov. 7 news conference. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n In explaining his decision, Kelly said he agreed with the government\u2019s argument that there was no First Amendment right to come onto the White House grounds. But, he said, once the White House opened up the grounds to reporters, the First Amendment applied. \n \n Kellly\u2019s ruling, however, primarily emphasized evidence indicating that the White House\u2019s decision to boot Acosta had violated the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees due process in government actions. He said the White House\u2019s decision-making was \u201cso shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me . . . who made the decision.\u201d The White House\u2019s later written arguments for banning Acosta were belated and were not sufficient to satisfy due process, Kelly said. \n \n \u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d \n \n Acosta added: \u201cI just want to thank all my colleagues in the press who supported me this week. I want to thank the judge [for this ruling]. And let\u2019s go back to work.\u201d \n \n In comments made in the Oval Office afterward, Trump said the White House would write rules to satisfy the court\u2019s due-process concerns. He also suggested his administration would keep up the legal fight with CNN. \u201cWe will end up back in court, and we will win,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cWe want total freedom of the press,\u201d Trump said. \u201c. . . But you have to act with respect when you\u2019re at the White House, and when I see the way some of my people get treated at news conferences, it\u2019s terrible. So we\u2019re setting up a certain standard, which is what the court is requesting.\u201d \n \n He added, \u201cWe always have the option of leaving, . . . and the other media and press in the room won\u2019t be happy.\u201d \n \n White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement after the ruling that \u201cthe court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House,\u201d although the judge actually said reporters have such rights once admitted. \n \n Sanders announced Acosta\u2019s \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension last week after the confrontation at the news conference. Trump and Sanders have had several run-ins with Acosta, stretching back to before Trump became president. \n \n Acosta watched Friday\u2019s proceedings from the courtroom in Washington, joined by a team of attorneys who included Theodore B. Olson, a former solicitor general in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and Theodore Boutrous, a star litigator and media-law specialist. \n \n CNN had argued that the ban on Acosta violated his First Amendment rights because it amounted to \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d \u2014 that is, the president was punishing the reporter for statements and coverage he did not like. The network has also said the action violated Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights because his exclusion followed no written guidelines or rules and had no appeal or review procedures. \n \n CNN had requested \u201cemergency\u201d relief from the judge, arguing that Acosta\u2019s rights were being violated with each passing hour. \n \n Until the White House\u2019s action last week, no reporter credentialed to cover the president had ever had a press pass revoked. \n \n A government attorney, James Burnham, argued in a hearing before Kelly on Wednesday that the president was within his rights to ban any reporter from the White House at any time, just as he excludes reporters from interviews in the Oval Office. He said Acosta could report on the president \u201cjust as effectively\u201d by watching the president on TV or by calling people within the White House. Burnham also said CNN would not be injured by Acosta\u2019s exclusion, since CNN has dozens of other journalists credentialed for the White House. \n \n Burnham said Trump\u2019s rationale for Acosta\u2019s ban was his \u201crudeness\u201d at last week\u2019s news conference, in effect arguing that Acosta\u2019s conduct, not his right to free speech, was the relevant issue. \n \n The assertions drew a rebuttal from Boutrous, CNN\u2019s attorney, who described the ban on the reporter as arbitrary, capricious and unprecedented. He said that White House reporters need access to the premises to meet with officials and to report on un\u00adtelevised \u201cgaggles,\u201d impromptu discussions with press aides and other officials, and that banning reporters from the grounds harms their ability to do their jobs. \n \n Media organizations have been alarmed by the White House\u2019s treatment of Acosta, saying that revoking his \u201chard pass\u201d to enter the White House is a threat to other journalists who might be similarly banned. Trump has suggested other reporters could face a similar fate if they displease him in some unspecified way. Thirteen news organizations, including The Washington Post and Fox News, jointly filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting CNN\u2019s position. \n \n The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which represents journalists in their negotiations over access to the president, filed a brief Thursday that urged the court \u201cto roundly reject the president\u2019s dangerous legal position.\u201d It disputed the government\u2019s claim that the president has \u201cabsolute, unbridled discretion to decide who can report from inside the White House.\u201d \n \n During the presidential campaign in 2015 and 2016, Trump banned more than a dozen news organizations from his rallies and public events, including The Post. He said he would not do something similar as president. Last week, he went back on that statement. \n \n Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign has used the CNN lawsuit to drum up contributions, portraying the suit as evidence of \u201cliberal bias\u201d \u2014 an assertion Boutrous brought up Wednesday in asserting that Trump had political reasons for banning Acosta. \n \n \u201cCNN is SUING President Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Secret Service agent, and other White House officials,\u201d the fundraising email says. \u201c . . . All because they REVOKED Jim Acosta\u2019s press badge after his continuous grandstanding and inappropriate refusal to yield to other reporters. \n \n \u201cPresident Trump will NOT put up with the media\u2019s liberal bias and utter disrespect for this Administration and the hardworking Americans who stand with us.\u201d",

    "document": "A Maypole topped with a swastika is raised for a May Day parade in the Lustgarten in Berlin. The May holiday became an important celebration in the Nazi calendar. Germany, April 26, 1939. \n \n The swastika is an ancient symbol that was in use in many different cultures for at least 5,000 years before Adolf Hitler made it the centerpiece of the Nazi flag. Its present-day use by certain extremist groups promotes hate. \n \n It was used at least 5,000 years before Adolf Hitler designed the Nazi flag. The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svastika, which means \u201cgood fortune\u201d or \u201cwell-being.\" The motif (a hooked cross) appears to have first been used in Neolithic Eurasia, perhaps representing the movement of the sun through the sky. To this day it is a sacred symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is a common sight on temples or houses in India and Indonesia. Swastikas also have an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian European cultures. For centuries a symbol of good luck and auspiciousness, the swastika even found expression in Byzantine and Christian art. \n \n The symbol experienced a resurgence in the late nineteenth century, following extensive archaeological work such as that of the famous German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann. Schliemann discovered the hooked cross on the site of ancient Troy in modern Turkey. He connected it with similar shapes found on pottery in Germany and speculated that it was a \u201csignificant religious symbol of our remote ancestors.\u201d \n \n However, the work of Schliemann soon was taken up by movements that wanted to evoke racial purity, \u201cAryan identity\u201d and German nationalist pride. \n \n This belief that the \u201cGerman race\u201d descended from the Aryan race is likely one of the main reasons the Nazi party formally adopted the swastika or Hakenkreuz (Ger., hooked cross) as its symbol in 1920. \n \n The Nazi Party, however, was not the only party to use the swastika in Germany. After World War I, a number of far-right nationalist movements adopted the swastika. As a symbol, it became associated with the idea of a racially \u201cpure\u201d state. By the time the Nazis gained control of Germany, the connotations of the swastika had forever changed. \n \n The swastika would become the most recognizable icon of Nazi propaganda, appearing on the flag referred to by Hitler in Mein Kampf as well as on election posters, armbands, medallions, and badges for military and other organizations. A potent symbol intended to elicit pride among Aryans, it also became a symbol of Nazi racial ideology that called for the elimination of Jews and other groups deemed inferior. \n \n In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler wrote: \n \n \u201cI myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.\u201d \n \n Further reading \n \n Heidtmann, Horst. \u201cSwastika.\u201d In Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, 937-939.

[ See more Russian Nazca Lines Photos \n \n A huge geoglyph in the shape of an elk or deer discovered in Russia may predate Peru's famous Nazca Lines by thousands of years. \n \n The animal-shaped stone structure, located near Lake Zjuratkul in the Ural Mountains, north of Kazakhstan, has an elongated muzzle, four legs and two antlers. A historical Google Earth satellite image from 2007 shows what may be a tail, but this is less clear in more recent imagery. \n \n Excluding the possible tail, the animal stretches for about 900 feet (275 meters) at its farthest points (northwest to southeast), the researchers estimate, equivalent to two American football fields. The figure faces north and would have been visible from a nearby ridge. \n \n \"The figure would initially have looked white and slightly shiny against the green grass background,\" write Stanislav Grigoriev, of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of History & Archaeology, and Nikolai Menshenin, of the State Centre for Monument Protection, in an article first detailing the discovery published last spring in the journal Antiquity. They note that it is now covered by a layer of soil. \n \n Fieldwork carried out this past summer has shed more light on the glyph's composition and date, suggesting it may be the product of a \"megalithic culture,\" researchers say. They note that hundreds of megalithic sites have been discovered in the Urals, with the most elaborate structures located on a freshwater island about 35 miles (60 km) northeast of the geoglyph. [See Photos of Russia's Nazca Lines] \n \n The Russian geoglyph was made out of stone, now covered by soil, and an archaeological team has been at work studying it. Credit: Image courtesy Stanislav Grigoriev. \n \n Discovery & excavation \n \n A man named Alexander Shestakov first discovered the glyphs using satellite images. He alerted researchers, who sent out a hydroplane and paraglider to survey the giant structure. \n \n This has since progressed to an on-the-ground excavation by a team led by Grigoriev. They've found that the stone architecture of the geoglyph is quite elaborate. When they excavated part of a hind leg the largest stones were on the edges, the smaller ones inside. This past summer they also found the remains of passageways and what appear to be small walls on the hoof and muzzle of the animal. \n \n \"The hoof is made of small crushed stones and clay. It seems to me there were very low walls and narrow passages among them. The same situation in the area of a muzzle: crushed stones and clay, four small broad walls and three passages,\" Grigorievwrote in an email to LiveScience. He cautioned that his team didn't excavate all the way down to the bottom of the walls, not wishing to damage the geoglyph. \n \n An image of the makeup of the leg of the Russian geoglyph. Credit: Image courtesy Stanislav Grigoriev. \n \n Dating the geoglyph \n \n Among the finds from the excavations are about 40 stone tools, made of quartzite, found on the structure's surface. Most of them are pickaxe-like tools called mattocks, useful for digging and chopping. \"Perhaps they were used to extract clay,\" he writes in the email. \n \n The style of stone-working called lithic chipping used on one artifact dates it to the Neolithic and Eneolithic (sixth to third millennia B.C.), though Grigoriev says the technology is more typical of the Eneolithic, between the fourth and third millennia B.C. \n \n If that date is correct, it would make the geoglyph far older than Peru's Nazca Lines, the very earliest of which were created around 500 B.C. Grigorievadded that current studies of ancient pollen at the site will help to narrow down the age. [Gallery: Aerial Photos Reveal Mysterious Stone Structures] \n \n In the Antiquity journal article, Grigoriev and Menshenin point out that palaeozoological studies show that the landscape in the southern Urals supported fewer trees in the Eneolithic, with forest growth not appearing until about 2,500 years ago. \"This means that there were open landscapes in the Eneolithic and Bronze Age, which allowed the hill figure to be created,\" they write. \n \n A megalithic culture \n \n Researchers say this geoglyph may have been built by a \"megalithic culture\" in the region that created stone monuments in prehistoric times. \n \n \"[M]any megalithic sites with features in common with European megaliths have been located: Some 300 are known but have not yet been studied in detail,\" write Grigoriev and Menshenin in the Antiquity article. Among these megaliths are numerous \"menhirs,\" large upright standing stones. \n \n The most spectacular megalithic complexes are on the relatively small Vera Island, located on Turgoyak Lake, about 35 miles (60 km) northeast of the geoglyph. \n \n Grigoriev and Julia Vasina of the South-Ural State University described the Vera Island megaliths in a 2010 article, noting the surviving portion of one monument, megalith two, as being covered by a mound and supporting a gallery and square chamber. Another monument, megalith one, is cut into the bedrock and covered by a mound consisting of stones, brown sand and lots of grass. It is more than 60 feet (19 meters) long and 20 feet (6 meters) wide. It contains three chambers one of which has \"bas relief sculptures\" in the shape of animals, probably a bull and wolf. \n \n Stone tools and ceramics found at the megalithic sites date them to between the Eneolithic period and the early Iron Age, around 3,000 years ago. Researchers emphasize more dating work needs to be done to verify; however, if the evidence holds, the giant geoglyph, along with the megaliths, were constructed millennia before Peru's Nazca Lines, a testament to the building prowess of an ancient prehistoric culture in the Ural Mountains. \n \n Follow LiveScience on Twitter at @livescience. We're also on Facebook & Google+. ||||| Over 50 geoglyphs have been discovered across the northern steppe of Kazakhstan, deepening the mystery of why the ancient patterns were created. \n \n Using Google Earth, archaeologists found the geoglyphs - man-made outlines on the ground made from mounds or ditches that are visible from above - in a variety of shapes, including squares, rings and swastikas. \n \n Often attributed to the sun, the swastika was used among the ancient Celts, Indians and Greeks, and later in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. In Asia, the symbol first appears in archaeological records around 2,500 BC in the Indus Valley Civilisation. \n \n \"As of today, we can say only one thing \u2013 the geoglyphs were built by ancient people,\" archaeologists Irina Shevnina and Andrew Logvin, who discovered the Kazakh geoglyphs, told Live Science. \n \n They added that other structures and evidence of fireplaces within the geoglyphs suggest rituals took place there. \n \n Experts have compared the findings in Kazakhstan to the famous Nazca Lines in Peru, which were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. \n \n Although some of the Peruvian geoglyphs resemble Paracas motifs, an Andean society that lived between 800 and 100 BCE, scholars believe they were created by the Nazca culture between 400 and 650 AD. \n \n In the past year, researchers from Kostanay University and Vilnius University in Lithuania have been conducting archaeological excavations, aerial photography and ground-penetrating radar surveys to examine the geoglyphs in Kazakhstan. \n \n The symbols vary in shapes and size. One swastika was made from timber, although the majority of the geoglyphs were made using mounds of earth. \n \n One of the largest measures 1,312ft in diameter, suggesting it was created by a larger, well-established culture, the researchers said. \n \n Ancient tribes may have used the geoglyphs to mark ownership of the land, but the reason behind the creation of the patterns remains unknown. \n \n Central Asia is pockmarked with other mysterious ancient constructions called kurgans, mounds heaped over a burial chamber. Found across Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Poland, the earliest kurgans appeared in the 4th millennium BC in the Caucasus and are associated with the Indo-Europeans. \n \n Geoglyphs and similar patterns have been discovered across the world, including in Britain, thanks to the introduction of Google Earth. In 2012, a giant elk-shaped geoglyph was discovered near Lake Zjuratkul in the Ural Mountains in Russia. \n \n The Kazakh geoglyphs were presented at the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul. ||||| More than 50 geoglyphs, including one shaped like a swastika, have been discovered in northern Kazakhstan. \n \n More than 50 geoglyphs with various shapes and sizes, including a massive swastika, have been discovered across northern Kazakhstan in Central Asia, say archaeologists. \n \n These sprawling structures, mostly earthen mounds, create the type of landscape art most famously seen in the Nazca region of Peru. \n \n Discovered using Google Earth, the geoglyphs are designed in a variety of geometric shapes, including squares, rings, crosses and swastikas (the swastika is a design that was used in ancient times). Ranging from 90 to 400 meters (295 to 1,312 feet) in diameter, some of them are longer than a modern-day aircraft carrier. Researchers say that the geoglyphs are difficult to see on the ground, but can easily be seen from the sky. [See Photos of the Amazing Geoglyphs in Kazakhstan] \n \n Over the past year, an archaeological expedition from Kazakhstan's Kostanay University, working in collaboration with Vilnius University in Lithuania, has been examining the geoglyphs. The team, which is conducting archaeological excavations, ground-penetrating radar surveys, aerial photography and dating, recently presented its initial results at the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul. \n \n The geoglyphs were made of earthen mounds. \n \n Archaeological excavations uncovered the remains of structures and hearths at the geoglyphs, suggesting that rituals took place there, said archaeologists Irina Shevnina and Andrew Logvin, of Kostanay University, in an email to Live Science. Ancient tribes may also have used the geoglyphs to mark ownership of the land, the researchers noted. \n \n \"As of today, we can say only one thing \u2014 the geoglyphs were built by ancient people. By whom and for what purpose, remains a mystery,\" said Shevnina and Logvin. \n \n Why they're builders used geometric shapes is also a mystery, although the swastika is an ancient symbol found throughout Europe and Asia. \n \n Geoglyphs around the world \n \n While Peru's Nazca Lines are the world's most famous geoglyphs, archaeological research suggests that geoglyphs were constructed in numerous areas around the world by different cultures. \n \n For instance, in the Middle East, archaeologists have found thousands of wheel-shaped structures that are easily visible from the sky, but hard to see on the ground. Also recently in Russia, archaeologists excavated a geoglyph shaped like an elk, which appears older than the Nazca Lines. \n \n Ancient geoglyphs have also been reported in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil and even the Southwestern United States. The introduction of high-resolution Google Earth imagery over the last decade has helped both professional archaeologists and amateurs detect and study these enigmatic structures. \n \n Editor's Note: This article was updated to reflect the fact that all of the geoglyphs were made of earthen mounds. \n \n Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Here a cluster of wheels in the Azraq Oasis. \n \n They stretch from Syria to Saudi Arabia, can be seen from the air but not the ground, and are virtually unknown to the public. \n \n They are the Middle East's own version of the Nazca Lines \u2014 ancient \"geolyphs,\" or drawings, that span deserts in southern Peru \u2014 and now, thanks to new satellite-mapping technologies, and an aerial photography program in Jordan, researchers are discovering more of them than ever before. They number well into the thousands. \n \n Referred to by archaeologists as \"wheels,\" these stone structures have a wide variety of designs, with a common one being a circle with spokes radiating inside. Researchers believe that they date back to antiquity, at least 2,000 years ago. They are often found on lava fields and range from 82 feet to 230 feet (25 meters to 70 meters) across. [See gallery of wheel structures] \n \n \"In Jordan alone we've got stone-built structures that are far more numerous than (the) Nazca Lines, far more extensive in the area that they cover, and far older,\" said David Kennedy, a professor of classics and ancient history at the University of Western Australia. \n \n Kennedy's new research, which will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science, reveals that these wheels form part of a variety of stone landscapes. These include kites (stone structures used for funnelling and killing animals); pendants (lines of stone cairns that run from burials); and walls, mysterious structures that meander across the landscape for up to several hundred feet and have no apparent practical use. \n \n His team's studies are part of a long-term aerial reconnaissance project that is looking at archaeological sites across Jordan. As of now, Kennedy and his colleagues are puzzled as to what the structures may have been used for or what meaning they held. [History's Most Overlooked Mysteries] \n \n Fascinating structures \n \n Kennedy's main area of expertise is in Roman archaeology, but he became fascinated by these structures when, as a student, he read accounts of Royal Air Force pilots flying over them in the 1920s on airmail routes across Jordan. \"You can't not be fascinated by these things,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Indeed, in 1927 RAF Flight Lt. Percy Maitland published an account of the ruins in the journal Antiquity. He reported encountering them over \"lava country\" and said that they, along with the other stone structures, are known to the Bedouin as the \"works of the old men.\" \n \n Kennedy and his team have been studying the structures using aerial photography and Google Earth, as the wheels are hard to pick up from the ground, Kennedy said. \n \n \"Sometimes when you're actually there on the site you can make out something of a pattern but not very easily,\" he said. \"Whereas if you go up just a hundred feet or so it, for me, comes sharply into focus what the shape is.\" \n \n The designs must have been clearer when they were originally built. \"People have probably walked over them, walked past them, for centuries, millennia, without having any clear idea what the shape was.\" \n \n (The team has created an archive of images of the wheels from various sites in the Middle East.) \n \n What were they used for? \n \n So far, none of the wheels appears to have been excavated, something that makes dating them, and finding out their purpose, more difficult. Archaeologists studying them in the pre-Google Earth era speculated that they could be the remains of houses or cemeteries. Kennedy said that neither of these explanations seems to work out well. \n \n \"There seems to be some overarching cultural continuum in this area in which people felt there was a need to build structures that were circular.\" \n \n Some of the wheels are found in isolation while others are clustered together. At one location, near the Azraq Oasis, hundreds of them can be found clustered into a dozen groups. \"Some of these collections around Azraq are really quite remarkable,\" Kennedy said. \n \n In Saudi Arabia, Kennedy's team has found wheel styles that are quite different: Some are rectangular and are not wheels at all; others are circular but contain two spokes forming a bar often aligned in the same direction that the sun rises and sets in the Middle East. \n \n The ones in Jordan and Syria, on the other hand, have numerous spokes and do not seem to be aligned with any astronomical phenomena. \"On looking at large numbers of these, over a number of years, I wasn't struck by any pattern in the way in which the spokes were laid out,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Cairns are often found associated with the wheels. Sometimes they circle the perimeter of the wheel, other times they are in among the spokes. In Saudi Arabia some of the cairns look, from the air, like they are associated with ancient burials. \n \n Dating the wheels is difficult, since they appear to be prehistoric, but could date to as recently as 2,000 years ago. The researchers have noted that the wheels are often found on top of kites, which date as far back as 9,000 years, but never vice versa. \"That suggests that wheels are more recent than the kites,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Amelia Sparavigna, a physics professor at Politecnico di Torino in Italy, told Live Science in an email that she agrees these structures can be referred to as geoglyphs in the same way as the Nazca Lines are. \"If we define a 'geoglyph' as a wide sign on the ground of artificial origin, the stone circles are geoglyphs,\" Sparavignawrote in her email. \n \n The function of the wheels may also have been similar to the enigmatic drawings in the Nazca desert. [Science as Art: A Gallery] \n \n \"If we consider, more generally, the stone circles as worship places of ancestors, or places for rituals connected with astronomical events or with seasons, they could have the same function of [the] geoglyphs of South America, the Nazca Lines for instance. The design is different, but the function could be the same,\" she wrote in her email. \n \n Kennedy said that for now the meaning of the wheels remains a mystery. \"The question is what was the purpose?\" \n \n Follow LiveScience for the latest in science news and discoveries on Twitter @livescience and on Facebook.",

Geoglyphs like these that resemble Peru's famous Nazca Lines have been found all over the world, including giant \"wheels\" in the Middle East and an elk-like structure in Russia. It may seem surprising at first that a swastika is one of the Kazakhstani creations\u2014and it was made of timber, not dirt, LiveScience notes\u2014but many ancient cultures and religions used the swastika long before Hitler appropriated it. \"Swastika\" is derived from the Sanskrit term for \"good fortune\" or \"well-being,\" and the symbol itself is believed to show the sun's movement in the sky, notes the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. \"As of today, we can say only one thing\u2014the geoglyphs were built by ancient people. By whom and for what purpose, remains a mystery,\" two of the project's scientists said in an email to LiveScience. (See what was revealed when sandstorms blew over the Peruvian desert last month.)",

    "document": "Strengths and limitations of this study We conducted a large population-based national survey of young adults, using a precise sampling frame. \n \n We included exposures to the sudden death of any close contact, to describe the impact of suicide bereavement whether related to the deceased or not. \n \n Our primary outcomes were validated measures of self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempt occurring after the bereavement, adjusted for prebereavement suicidal behaviour and psychopathology. \n \n We compared bereavement by suicide with bereavement due to sudden natural causes, then separately compared those bereaved by suicide with those bereaved due to sudden unnatural death to measure the specific impact of suicide bereavement. \n \n Given the possibility of selection bias (favouring higher social classes) and male non-response bias, the results of this study may be more generalisable to young bereaved women than men, and to the more highly educated. \n \n Introduction Suicide bereavement describes the period of grief, mourning and adjustment after a suicide death, that is experienced by family members, friends and any other contacts of the deceased affected by the loss.1 It is estimated to affect up to 9% of adolescents2 and 7% of adults3 annually. Since 1989, the WHO has suggested that relatives and close friends of people who die by suicide are a high-risk group for suicide.4 Explanations include the particular psychological trauma of a suicide loss, which involves grief and agonising self-questioning; shared familial and environmental risk; suicide contagion through the process of social modelling1; and the burden of stigma associated with violent losses.1 ,5 Quantitative studies confirm that people bereaved by suicide and other violent deaths perceive greater stigma than other bereaved groups.1 Their qualitative accounts are of others\u2019 distaste or embarrassment over the disturbing nature of an unnatural loss,5 and a loss of community support,6 ,7 with the effect of reducing help seeking and perceptions of the support available.7 As stigma may be more modifiable than other potential explanatory factors, there is interest in understanding its relationship to suicide-related outcomes after negative life events.1 International suicide prevention strategies have placed great emphasis on the provision of support for people bereaved by suicide,1 despite the lack of studies confirming that risk of adverse outcomes applies beyond the effect of any sudden loss.1 ,8 There is also little evidence for effective interventions after suicide.9 Studies comparing people bereaved by suicide with non-bereaved controls support an increased probability of suicide following any bereavement.10 Those using controls bereaved by non-suicide causes go further in supporting an association between sudden bereavement and suicide-related outcomes.10 ,11 However, risk of hospital-treated suicide attempt is similar in adults bereaved by suicide and those bereaved by accidental deaths,12 suggesting that the wider risk factor is bereavement by any unnatural causes. Only study designs separating out control groups bereaved by sudden natural and sudden unnatural causes, adjusted for prebereavement psychopathology, can determine whether adverse outcomes are attributable to violent deaths or more specifically to suicide.1 Our recent systematic review highlighted the lack of such studies.1 It also found that no British studies had investigated suicide-related outcomes after suicide bereavement,13 and no studies using bereaved controls had measured the impact of peer suicide.1 This is despite widespread concern about the susceptibility of young people to social modelling of self-harm14 ,15 and recent increases in suicides among young men.16 Our objective was to design a study that could investigate whether there is a specific association between suicide bereavement and suicide attempt by making distinct comparisons between bereavement by suicide, unnatural causes and sudden natural causes. Use of routine clinical data was precluded because these record exposure only to mortality of first-degree relatives and cohabitees, and hospital presentations of self-harm. Conversely, survey methods permit ascertainment of exposure to all bereavements, and self-reported suicidality and self-harm, and are therefore a vital tool for investigating risk of suicidal events following suicide bereavement. We therefore undertook a population-based cross-sectional survey comparing the impact of specific modes of self-reported sudden bereavement on non-fatal suicide-related outcomes. Our primary hypothesis was that young adults in the UK who had been bereaved by suicide were at higher risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts than those bereaved by other causes of sudden death. Collecting data on two control groups allowed us to address two research questions. First, comparison with adults bereaved by sudden natural causes of death took into account the sudden nature of the loss. Second, comparison with adults bereaved by sudden unnatural causes took into account the violent nature of the loss. Hypothesis 2 was that suicide bereavement would be a risk factor for four secondary clinical and occupational measures (postbereavement non-suicidal self-harm, depression, occupational drop-out and social dysfunction), reflecting policy concerns about the contribution of bereavement to workplace mental ill health and sickness absence.17 Hypothesis 3 was that the impact of suicide bereavement would extend beyond genetic relatedness to peer suicides, and would therefore not be modified by relatedness to the deceased. Hypothesis 4 was that any associations with clinical or occupational outcomes would be attenuated by perceived stigma, as a marker for reduced help seeking. \n \n Methods Study design and participants We invited all young adults working or studying at UK higher education institutions (HEIs) to participate in a closed, online study about sudden bereavement: the UCL Bereavement Study. We anticipated that using the email systems of large institutions would be the best means of accessing hard-to-reach groups, particularly those not normally accessing health services, and avoiding the biases associated with recruiting a help-seeking sample.18 Sampling from a diverse range of colleges, universities, art and drama schools, and agricultural colleges offered unique access to a large defined sample of young adults. All 164 HEIs in the UK in 2010 were invited to participate, following up non-responding HEIs to encourage broad socioeconomic and geographic representation. Over 20% of HEIs (37/164) agreed to take part, with a higher response (40%) from those classified as the more prestigious Russell Group of universities. This provided a sampling frame of 659 572 staff and students. All participants were invited to take part in a survey of \u2018the impact of sudden bereavement on young adults\u2019, with the aim of masking them to the specific study hypotheses. There was no accurate way of measuring response, as the denominator of bereaved people was not ascertainable using routine data or survey methods. The majority of participating HEIs agreed to send an individual email invitation with embedded survey link to each staff and student member. For reasons of sensitivity (recent staff/student deaths), 10 HEIs modified this strategy, for example, by emailing students only, using their weekly news digest email, or advertising via staff and student intranet. Inclusion criteria were as follows: people aged 18\u201340 who, since the age of 10, had experienced sudden bereavement of a close friend or relative. The 18\u201340 age range was defined to reflect an under-researched group of great policy interest.16 Early childhood bereavements were excluded to minimise recall bias and restrict our focus to adult cognitive processing of life events, using the age threshold for criminal responsibility in England and Wales. A close contact was defined as \u2018a relative or friend who mattered to you, and from whom you were able to obtain support, either emotional or practical\u2019. Sudden bereavement was operationalised as \u2018a death that could not have been predicted at that time and which occurred suddenly or within a matter of days\u2019. Exposure status was classified by responses to the question: \u2018Since you were aged 10 have you experienced a sudden bereavement of someone close to you due to any of the following: (1) sudden natural death (eg, cardiac arrest, epileptic seizure, stroke); (2) sudden unnatural death (eg, road crash, murder or manslaughter, work accident); (3) suicide?\u2019 Mode of death was defined subjectively by the respondent, and not by coroner's verdict or death certificate, as perception of bereavement type was the exposure of interest. In the case of more than one exposure, we adopted a hierarchical approach favouring those bereaved by suicide, for whom we anticipated the lowest base rate. This group were classified as suicide bereaved regardless of other exposures. Those bereaved by more than one non-suicide sudden death were asked to relate their responses to whichever person they had felt closest to, with exposure status classified accordingly. We estimated that a minimum of 466 participants would be required in any one group (two-tailed analysis; 90% power) to detect a doubling of the UK community prevalence of lifetime suicide attempt (6.5%) in young adult samples.19 We chose a relatively large effect size to reflect our comparison to a non-bereaved baseline, lacking prevalence figures for bereaved UK samples. Procedures The questionnaire (see online supplementary material) was designed in consultation with a group of young bereaved adults and bereavement counsellors, who identified important domains to cover in relation to the impact of bereavement, and was piloted with individuals accessing support from national bereavement support organisations. It elicited quantitative data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including a personality disorder screen,20 and nine putative confounding variables identified a priori from existing literature and clinical judgement: age, gender, socioeconomic status, other family history of suicide (excluding index bereavement), years since bereavement, kinship to the deceased, prebereavement depression, prebereavement suicide attempt and prebereavement non-suicidal self-harm. These reflected the observed vulnerabilities of people bereaved by suicide, even before the loss,1 which are likely to reflect shared familial and environmental risk. We measured perceived stigma using the stigmatisation subscale of the Grief Experience Questionnaire (GEQ),6 with items such as \u2018Since the death how often did you feel avoided by friends?\u2019 Responses on a Likert-style scale generated scores of 5\u201325. Our two main outcomes were self-reported suicidal ideation (\u2018Have you ever thought of taking your life, even though you would not actually do it?\u2019)21 and self-reported suicide attempt (\u2018Have you ever made an attempt to take your life, by taking an overdose of tablets or in some other way?\u2019).22 These standardised measures were taken from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS),19 a national seven-yearly population survey in England, and were qualified by whether these occurred before or after the sudden bereavement, to derive an incident measure. Our four secondary measures were: postbereavement non-suicidal self-harm (self-poisoning and self-injury without suicidal intent) using a standardised APMS measure22 (adapted as above); depression using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) screen for lifetime depression23 (adapted as above); occupational drop-out (from work or education) using a binary measure developed for this study; and poor social functioning using the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ).24 Statistical analysis We summarised sample characteristics by exposure group, using \u03c72 tests (categorical variables) and one-way analysis of variance (continuous variables). We then used multivariable regression to estimate the strength of associations between suicide bereavement and outcomes. We fitted binary models using xtlogit commands in Stata,25 with HEI as random effect, to take into account the clustering effect at HEI level. Each multivariable model included nine prespecified confounding variables, described above. Models used complete case analysis, with a significance threshold of p=0.05 for primary outcomes and p=0.01 for secondary outcomes. Our primary comparison used bereavement by sudden natural causes as the reference category, quantifying risk of adverse outcomes in adults bereaved by suicide, and in adults bereaved by sudden unnatural causes. We conducted a second comparison between adults bereaved by suicide and the reference category of adults bereaved by sudden unnatural causes. We tested hypothesis 3, whether the effect of suicide bereavement was modified by kinship (blood-related vs non-blood-related), by adding an interaction term to all models. Hypothesis 4, whether stigma attenuated associations, was tested by including stigma scores in multivariable models. A series of a priori defined sensitivity analyses were conducted. These assessed the robustness of our main findings when using best-case and worst-case scenarios to impute missing values, and when applying more stringent inclusion criteria (excluding participants from the 10 HEIs that had modified the stipulated recruitment method; excluding participants from the 18 HEIs with participant numbers below the median cluster size). Finally, we conducted a set of four post hoc analyses to describe probability estimates in those bereaved by the death of an older person; in a student-only sample; and in women (as the study was underpowered to add gender as an interaction term to models); and to ascertain whether exposure to more than one mode of sudden bereavement might attenuate associations (by adding this variable to final models). All analyses were conducted using Stata V.12 (StataCorp, Texas, USA). \n \n Results A total of 5085 people of the 659 572 sampled responded to the questionnaire by clicking on the survey link, with 91% consenting to participate, and 68% (n=3432) fulfilling eligibility (see figure 1). Overall 18% had been exposed to more than one mode of sudden bereavement (see figure 2), which was significantly more common in the group bereaved by suicide (see table 1). Clustering of participants within the 37 HEIs was minimal for primary outcomes (see table 1). Missing data for model covariates and outcomes were less than 7%. Table 1 Characteristics of participants by type of bereavement exposure Figure 1 Participant flow. Figure 2 Euler diagram showing the combinations of exposures in eligible sample of 3432 respondents. Participant characteristics The sample was primarily female, white and blood-related to the deceased (see table 1). Of those reporting the loss of a non-blood-related contact, 74% described them as a friend, 11% a partner, 4% an ex-partner and 12% a step/adoptive/in-law family member. There were no statistically significant differences between the exposure groups in relation to mean age, gender, self-defined ethnicity, socioeconomic status, level of current social support or personality difficulties. People bereaved by suicide were significantly more likely to report prebereavement psychopathology, and a family history of psychiatric problems. Those bereaved by sudden unnatural causes or by suicide reported a lower mean age of the deceased than those bereaved by sudden natural causes, and were also less likely to report the loss of a blood relative. The mean time elapsed since bereavement was 4.9 years (SD=5.3; range=1 day to 30 years), with no evidence for group differences. In each exposure group, the prevalence of prebereavement suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm (but not suicide attempt) exceeded estimates for UK population norms in corresponding age groups.19 Bereavement by suicide compared with that by sudden natural causes In comparison with bereavement by sudden natural causes (see table 2), those bereaved by suicide had a greater probability of postbereavement suicide attempt (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.65; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.42; p=0.012), but not of suicidal ideation. The suicide-bereaved group also had a greater probability of occupational drop-out (AOR=1.80; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.71; p=0.005), but there was no evidence for group differences in postbereavement non-suicidal self-harm, depression or social functioning. Table 2 Estimates of the relationship between postbereavement outcomes and bereavement exposure (sudden natural death as reference category) Comparison between bereavement by sudden unnatural causes and the reference category of adults bereaved by sudden natural causes showed no evidence for any group differences. Bereavement by suicide compared with that by sudden unnatural causes When directly compared with bereavement by sudden unnatural death, adults bereaved by suicide had a similar probability of postbereavement suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (see table 3). The probability of poor social functioning was significantly greater in adults bereaved by suicide (AOR=1.46; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89; p=0.005), but there were no differences in postbereavement non-suicidal self-harm, depression or occupational drop-out. Table 3 Estimates of the relationship between postbereavement outcomes and bereavement exposure (suicide vs sudden unnatural death) Kinship as a potential effect modifier Tests for an interaction between bereavement exposure and kinship to the deceased found that none of the significant or non-significant associations between suicide bereavement and adverse outcomes were modified by relatedness. This was the case even when excluding the 253 respondents who reported the death of a partner, ex-partner or non-blood relative, to describe associations in a group bereaved by peer death. Stigma as a potential confounder Adding stigma scores to adjusted models for significant associations between suicide bereavement and adverse outcomes attenuated ORs, as predicted, with no evidence for group differences between those bereaved by suicide and those bereaved by sudden natural causes in postbereavement suicide attempt (AOR=1.11; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.67; p=0.610) or occupational drop-out (AOR=1.36; 95% CI 0.89 to 2.09; p=0.156), or between those bereaved by suicide and those bereaved by sudden unnatural causes in terms of poor social functioning (AOR=1.06; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.41; p=0.667). Sensitivity analyses Main findings were unchanged after sensitivity analyses simulating worst-case and best-case scenarios for missing values, and after those simulating other potential biases, suggesting that any biases introduced had not resulted in an underestimation or overestimation of the risks. Post hoc sensitivity analyses The magnitude and direction of the association between suicide bereavement and suicide attempt (compared with bereavement by sudden natural causes) were similar after excluding 769 participants bereaved by the death of someone aged over 60 (AOR=1.78; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.71; p=0.008), to exclude deaths that might be less unexpected. They were also unchanged when excluding 399 staff (AOR=1.73; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.59; p=0.007), and in a women-only sample (AOR=1.66; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.53; p=0.018). When compared with women bereaved by sudden unnatural causes, women bereaved by suicide had an increased probability of postbereavement suicide attempt (AOR=1.71; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.85; p=0.036), whereas in the full sample no association was found. When taking into account the higher prevalence of repeated exposure to sudden bereavement in the suicide bereaved group, ORs were attenuated and no significant findings remained. There was therefore no evidence of group differences between the suicide bereaved group and those bereaved by sudden natural causes in relation to postbereavement suicide attempt (AOR=1.53; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.35; p=0.054) or occupational drop-out (AOR=1.54; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.43; p=0.062), or between those bereaved by suicide and those bereaved by sudden unnatural causes in relation to poor social functioning (AOR=1.41; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.84; p=0.013). \n \n Discussion Our main finding was of a specific association between bereavement by suicide and subsequent suicide attempt among young adults who experience sudden bereavement. This was not attributable to prebereavement suicidality, despite higher rates of prebereavement psychopathology; a finding in keeping with the literature1 and suggestive of shared familial and environmental risk. Previous studies using non-bereaved controls or heterogeneous bereaved controls were not able to rule out the possibility that exposure to any sudden bereavement explains adverse outcomes. Our study supports a specific association between suicide bereavement and suicide-related outcomes, justifying the inclusion of people bereaved by suicide in national suicide prevention strategies. This study also provides the first evidence that blood relatedness to the deceased does not modify the association between suicide bereavement and suicide attempt, confirming that risk also applies to adults bereaved by peer suicide. Such findings must be interpreted in the context of a highly educated sample, in which exposure to violent losses may be lower than in a more nationally representative (but harder to recruit) sample. The absence of an association between suicide bereavement and suicidal ideation or depression is striking, as is the high prevalence of prebereavement and postbereavement suicidal ideation and depression in all three exposure groups. This may be explained by high baseline rates of depressive and suicidal thoughts among students,26 reducing the chances of detecting a difference. It is also possible that while suicidal thinking after sudden loss is common, suicide bereavement is particularly powerful in precipitating suicide attempt in a suicidal person, whether due to enhanced awareness of means, reduced fear of death or social modelling.27 The non-significant differences in the probability of suicidality and depression when comparing adults bereaved by suicide and by sudden unnatural causes are noteworthy, requiring further studies comparing outcomes in those bereaved by suicide and other unnatural causes. The clinical implications of these findings are that clinicians assessing suicide risk should inquire not only about a history of suicide in blood relatives, but also in friends and non-blood relatives. Employers should be aware of the impact of suicide bereavement on occupational functioning, and make adjustments to promote workplace mental health. The associations between suicide bereavement and adverse outcomes became non-significant when adding perceived stigma. This is an indicator that stigma might be a marker for motivational moderators of suicidality after a negative life event, such as reluctance to seek help, thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness.27 However, further investigation is warranted to determine whether stigma can be said to lie on the causal pathway. This study suggests a role for psychosocial interventions delivered after a potentially traumatic loss to address problem solving and help seeking, and the quality of community support. Although not prehypothesised, the associations were also attenuated by repeated exposure to sudden losses among the suicide bereaved. This is suggestive of a substantial contribution of familial and environmental risk factors for premature death shared with social networks, and a reduced fear of death due to habituation. This acquired capability to attempt suicide27 would require sensitive exploration in a clinical interview. Our study is of policy importance in specifying that friends as well as relatives warrant support after a suicide, addressing the vagueness of suicide prevention strategies on how extensively to offer support.1 The WHO estimates that 800 000 people die by suicide annually,28 and 60 people are now understood to affected by each suicide death.29 This means that 48 million people are bereaved by suicide worldwide every year. Further research describing moderators of risk will help determine whether there is a rationale for screening members of this heterogeneous group. Trials are also needed to identify evidence-based interventions delivered after suicide bereavement to reduce the risk of suicide-related outcomes, including those that address stigma. This study's key strengths are its national population-based sample size, and ability to access those who do not normally participate in research. It is the largest scale survey conducted in any country comparing self-reported suicide-related outcomes in those bereaved by suicide and other mortality causes. Previous studies using national registries have achieved larger sample sizes, but under-recorded exposures and lacked self-reported outcomes such as untreated suicide attempts.10\u201312 ,30 ,30 ,31 Unlike previous surveys, we tested clear a priori hypotheses, accounted for prebereavement psychopathology, and used standardised measures for seven of eight outcomes. A precise sampling frame accessed a large community sample of young adults, otherwise under-represented in health research, while minimising the biases inherent to using help-seeking groups. Coroner misclassification of suicides as accidental deaths was less of a problem than in other studies as we used the respondent's perception of cause of death, with minimal potential for respondent misclassification. Levels of missing data within models were low, and results were robust to sensitivity analysis simulating non-response and possible selection biases. Chance findings were unlikely as group sizes exceeded the minimum required for adequate power and the significance threshold was more stringent for secondary outcomes than primary. Lack of information on response might be a considered a limitation, but no method permitted accurate estimation of the bereaved denominator. It is reasonable to assume that most non-responders had not been exposed to sudden bereavement, and that a minority were ineligible by age. Our hierarchical approach to classifying suicide exposure may have overestimated the effect of suicide bereavement due to clustering of violent bereavements, but we did not measure number of exposures to each type of bereavement. Our definition of non-suicidal self-harm followed that used for establishing UK population norms,19 but may differ from others given wide international definitional variations. Recall bias may have influenced judgements about the onset and severity of difficulties, particularly among those bereaved by violent causes, with the potential to overestimate risks in these groups. Residual confounding is possible in relation to unmeasured variables such as financial hardship, social modelling, substance misuse and complicated grief (which was not measured as data collection preceded Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)32). Non-response bias (from men, those most distressed), survivor bias and selection bias (favouring higher social classes) may have resulted in an underestimation of risks due to the higher probability of suicide-related outcomes in disadvantaged men16 and those worst affected by the loss. An HEI sample is not representative of all UK-based young adults, despite inclusion of diverse institutions, and this limits generalisability of findings to those not entering higher education. While selection bias and male non-response bias were equally distributed between the three exposure groups, the results of this study may be more generalisable to young bereaved women than men, and to the more highly educated. Nevertheless, the findings do constitute the best available evidence describing the impact of peer suicide on young adults using appropriate controls. \n \n Conclusions Bereavement by suicide is a specific risk factor for suicide attempt when compared with bereavement due to sudden natural causes, whether blood-related to the deceased or not. As the association between suicide bereavement and suicide attempt is attenuated when taking into account perceived stigma, further investigation of the role of stigma and reduced help seeking is warranted. Such work will inform the development of acceptable interventions delivered after potentially traumatic losses. Our findings suggest that suicide risk assessment should extend screening for a family history of suicide to any history of suicide in non-blood relatives and friends. However, until we have evidence-based interventions for this group, the best ways of mitigating this risk of suicide attempt are unclear. ||||| People bereaved by the sudden death of a friend or family member are 65 percent more likely to attempt suicide if the deceased died by suicide than if they died by natural causes \n \n People bereaved by the sudden death of a friend or family member are 65% more likely to attempt suicide if the deceased died by suicide than if they died by natural causes. This brings the absolute risk up to 1 in 10, reveals new UCL research funded by the Medical Research Council. \n \n The researchers studied 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved, to examine the specific impacts associated with bereavement by suicide. The results are published in BMJ Open. \n \n As well as the increased risk of suicide attempt, those bereaved by suicide were also 80% more likely to drop out of education or work. In total, 8% of the people bereaved by suicide had dropped out of an educational course or a job since the death. \n \n \"Our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members,\" says study author Dr Alexandra Pitman (UCL Psychiatry). \"However, these outcomes are by no means inevitable. If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available. There is a guide called Help is at Hand, written by people affected by suicide, which offers emotional and practical advice as well as information on organisations that can offer further support. \n \n \"We know that people can find it difficult to know what to say to someone who has recently been bereaved. However, saying something is often better than saying nothing, and simple gestures like offering practical help with day-to-day activities can mean a lot. For example, when a colleague bereaved by suicide returns to work after compassionate leave then it could be helpful to ask how they are and offer to help them with their workload. Employers should be aware of the significant impact that suicide bereavement has on people's working lives and make adjustments to help their staff return to work.\" \n \n The study also found that people who had been bereaved by suicide tended to perceive more social stigma around the death. When the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma to reflect this, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared. While further research is required, this suggests that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might be one way to help to limit its impact on people's lives. \n \n \"British people can be very uncomfortable talking about death, and suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" explains Dr Pitman. \"However, avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatised, and sometimes even blamed for the death. People bereaved by suicide should not be made to feel in any way responsible, and should be treated with the same compassion as people bereaved by any other cause. Suicide is a complex issue and there is often no simple explanation for why someone chooses to take their own life. Although one often hears people refer to a relationship break-up or a redundancy as the trigger for a suicide, this is far too simplistic and in reality it is often a culmination of different life events rather than one individual 'cause'.\" \n \n Previous studies have shown family history of suicide to be a risk factor for suicide attempt, so risk assessments in hospitals, prisons and social care settings are designed to take this into account. However, the new study suggests that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should also be considered when assessing suicide risk. Asking about the impact of a suicidal loss will also give professionals a sense of how it has affected their day-to-day functioning, and whether feeling stigmatised has prevented them from accessing help. \n \n ### ||||| People bereaved by suicide of a friend or family member are 65 per cent more likely to kill themselves than the ones whose relatives died of natural causes, a new study has claimed.People coming in contact with ones displaying self-destructive behaviour are more likely to show a suicidal tendency.It is common among vulnerable people - especially teens and young adults. This is called \"suicide contagion.\" Contagion includes indirect as well as direct exposure to suicide, as Health and Human Services explains.

    "document": "When Jane Austen died in 1817, aged 41, her portable writing desk was inherited by her sister Cassandra. It was later passed down through her eldest brother\u2019s family. In 1999, Joan Austen-Leigh, Jane Austen\u2019s great-great-great-niece, very generously entrusted it to the care of the British Library. Among the items that had been stored for generations in the desk drawer were three pairs of spectacles. According to family tradition, they all belonged to Jane Austen. \n \n Spectacles believed to have belonged to Jane Austen (now British Library Add MS 86841/2-4): wire-framed pair (on left), \u2018tortoiseshell pair A\u2019 (centre), \u2018tortoiseshell pair B\u2019 (on right, with string wound around arm). \n \n The British Library has for the first time had the spectacles tested. Our Conservation department was involved from the start, to ensure that no harm would come to them. The company Birmingham Optical kindly supplied us with a lensmeter to measure their strength, and their specialist staff undertook the tests. \n \n \n \n Louis Cabena (left) and Deep Singh (right) from Birmingham Optical, with lensmeter and spectacles in the British Library Conservation Centre. \n \n The tests revealed that the three pairs of spectacles are all convex or \u2018plus\u2019 lenses, so would have been used by someone longsighted. In other words their owner needed glasses for close-up tasks, such as reading. Interestingly, \u2018tortoiseshell pair B\u2019 is much stronger than the others. \n \n Test results \n \n Wire-framed pair: R. + 1.75 DS L. +1.75 DS (PD 27.0 53.0 26.0) \n \n Tortoiseshell pair A: R. + 3.25 DS L. +3.25 DS (PD 26.0 56.0 30.0) \n \n Tortoiseshell pair B: R. +5.00/-0.25 x 84 L. +4.75/-0.25 x 49 (PD 28.5 55.0 26.5) \n \n We showed these results to the London-based optometrist Professor Simon Barnard. He believes there are a number of possible reasons for the variation in strength. Jane Austen may always have been longsighted, and initially used the wire-framed pair for reading and distance viewing. She later required a slightly stronger pair (tortoiseshell pair A) for reading, and used the strongest pair (tortoiseshell pair B) for extremely close work, such as fine embroidery, which would have been held closer to the face than a book. \n \n Austen is known to have had problems with her eyes. She complained in several letters about her \u2018weak\u2019 eyes. Could it be that she gradually needed stronger and stronger glasses for reading because of a more serious underlying health problem? Professor Barnard believes this is a possibility. He points out that certain systemic health problems can cause changes in the vision of both longsighted and shortsighted people. Diabetes is one such condition, because it can induce cataracts. A gradually developing cataract would mean that an individual would need a stronger and stronger prescription, over time, in order to undertake close-up tasks. However, diabetes was fatal at that time, so someone might not have lived long enough to require several different prescriptions in succession. \n \n If Austen did develop cataracts, a more likely cause, according to Professor Barnard, is accidental poisoning from a heavy metal such as arsenic. Arsenic poisoning is now known to cause cataracts. Despite its toxicity, arsenic was commonly found in medicines in 19th-century England, as well as in some water supplies. In this situation, Austen would have switched from using the wire-framed pair to tortoiseshell pair A, then pair B, as her cataracts got progressively worse. \n \n Jane Austen\u2019s early death has in the past been attributed to Addison\u2019s disease (an endocrine disorder), cancer and tuberculosis. In 2011, the crime writer Lindsay Ashford suggested that Austen died of arsenic poisoning. She came to this conclusion after reading Austen\u2019s description of the unusual facial pigmentation she suffered at the end of her life \u2013 something commonly found with arsenic poisoning. Ashford\u2019s novel The Mysterious Death of Miss Austen strays from theories of accidental poisoning into rather more fantastical murder. The variations in the strength of the British Library\u2019s three pairs of spectacles may indeed give further credence to the theory that Austen suffered from arsenic poisoning, albeit accidental. \n \n We should, however, inject a note of caution at this point: although prescription lenses were in use in Austen\u2019s day, we don\u2019t know whether these glasses were prescribed for her by a physician, or whether she bought them \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019. We can\u2019t be completely sure that she wore them at all. However, we are keen to publish these test results in the hope that other eye specialists will share their ideas and opinions with us. \n \n We know this subject is already of interest to literary scholars. Janine Barchas and Elizabeth Picherit of the University of Texas at Austin have taken a keen interest in the spectacles in the British Library, and have also been investigating Austen\u2019s references to spectacles in her novels. Their theories have now been published in the journal Modern Philology. We look forward to further discussions and debate on this topic. The spectacles themselves have just gone on display in the British Library\u2019s free Treasures Gallery for all to see. \n \n Dr Sandra Tuppen \n \n Lead Curator, Modern Archives & Manuscripts 1601-1850 \n \n The British Library \n \n Email: sandra.tuppen@bl.uk ||||| The British Library has announced several pairs of glasses found in Jane Austen's writing desk may reveal what caused the early death of the one of the world's most-loved authors. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) \n \n On July 18, 1817, novelist Jane Austen died at the age of 41. Much of Austen\u2019s medical biography is murky, and how she died remains an enduring mystery. Historians, in the two centuries since, have dissected what little evidence exists. In her later letters she complained of bilious attacks, facial aches and fever. Austen experts fingered several possible killers, including stomach cancer, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma or an adrenal disorder known as Addison\u2019s disease. \n \n An article published Thursday on the website of the nationally run British Library offered a theory of a more dramatic sort: What if poison, not cancer or faulty glands, did in the author of \u201cSense and Sensibility?\u201d \n \n If so, blame neither foul plot nor gentleman assassin. The arsenic likely came from a tainted water supply or a medicinal mix-up, the library suggested; that is, of course, supposing the element caused Austen\u2019s death. The claim has been subject to a fair bit of skepticism since Thursday, when the library published an article on its website linking her possible cataracts to arsenic. \n \n The library\u2019s reasoning hinged on spectacles. In 1999, the writer\u2019s great-great-great-niece Joan Austen-Leigh donated a desk that belonged to Austen. The library discovered that the desk held three pairs of glasses, two tortoiseshell and one wire-framed. The British Library recently had the glasses examined, and found that the lenses were convex, suggesting a farsighted wearer. \n \n Engraving of Jane Austen based on a portrait by her sister Cassandra. \n \n Austen eventually suffered from very poor eyesight, if the eyeglasses indeed belonged to her. The glasses varied in strengths. One of two tortoiseshell glasses, according to the British Library\u2019s analysis, was quite strong. Perhaps the glasses\u2019 increasing diopters told a narrative. \n \n \u201cCould it be that she gradually needed stronger and stronger glasses for reading because of a more serious underlying health problem?\u201d wrote Sandra Tuppen, a curator at the library, in the article. \u201cThe variations in the strength of the British Library\u2019s three pairs of spectacles may indeed give further credence to the theory that Austen suffered from arsenic poisoning, albeit accidental.\u201d \n \n This was not the only evidence to suggest arsenic poisoning, the article noted. Austen complained of skin discoloration (\u201cblack & white & every wrong colour,\u201d she once wrote), which may also be a symptom of accumulating arsenic in the body. And inadvertent arsenic poisoning in the 1800s was not unheard of. Crime writer Lindsay Ashford, one of the first proponents of the arsenic theory, told the Guardian in 2011 that, \u201cI think it\u2019s highly likely she was given a medicine containing arsenic. When you look at her list of symptoms and compare them to the list of arsenic symptoms, there is an amazing correlation.\u201d \n \n By the heyday of the Victorian era, arsenic was ubiquitous in Britain, present in medicines and occasionally confused for sugar or plaster of Paris. Green wallpapers and green dresses contained arsenic, according to the Chemical Heritage Foundation\u2019s Distillations magazine, as did \u201cbeer, wine, sweets, wrapping paper, painted toys, sheep dip, insecticides, clothing, dead bodies, stuffed animals, hat ornaments, coal and candles.\u201d In 1858, a British candy seller nicknamed \u201cHumbug Billy\u201d killed 25 and poisoned more than 100 others when, meaning to dilute the expensive sugar in his peppermint sweets, he accidentally added arsenic. \n \n The British Library cited Simon Barnard, an optometrist based in London, who believed that if Austen\u2019s eyesight worsened \u2014 indicating cataracts \u2014 heavy metal poisoning was a leading candidate. Other cataract causes, such as diabetes, would likely have killed Austen before her eyesight dimmed to the point of needing the strongest tortoiseshell glasses. \n \n Though Austen\u2019s deteriorating eyesight has been a source of intrigue, past experts hesitated to ascribe it mortal significance. The British Library took a \u201cquantum leap\u201d when its conclusion jumped to arsenic, University of Texas at Austin 18th-century literature expert and Austen scholar Janine Barchas said to the New York Times. \n \n New Zealand-based ophthalmologist Graham Wilson published a medical analysis of the author\u2019s eye problems, which Wilson traced to a 23-year-old Austen. Given the evidence available to Wilson, the doctor concluded in the 2012 paper that, \u201cThere are many references to eyes in her novels, but Jane\u2019s eyes and those of her characters cannot contribute further to the debate around the cause of her death at age 41.\u201d \n \n The debate around Austen\u2019s death kicked off in 1964, when Zachary Cope, an English surgeon, argued that Addison\u2019s disease killed Austen. He noted her fatigue, hyperpigmentation (discoloration) and weakness during bouts of emotional stress. It made for a convincing argument. Several Austen biographers, including Deirdre Le Faye, author of \u201cJane Austen: A Family Record,\u201d contend that Addison\u2019s disease was the culprit. \n \n But Annette Upfal , an Austen scholar then at the University of Queensland in Australia, wrote in 2005 at BMJ\u2019s Medical Humanities that it was not a sudden attack of Addison\u2019s disease but a longer history of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Upfal teased out a history of illness in Austen\u2019s letters, including persistent neuralgia and cycles of fever leading up to her death. \n \n \u201cDespite traditional accounts, this was not a case of a healthy person being suddenly struck down with a fatal illness,\u201d Upfal wrote. \u201cNew medical evidence suggests that Jane was already suffering from an immune deficiency and fatal lymphoma in January 1813, when her second and most popular novel, \u2018Pride and Prejudice,\u2019 was published.\u201d \n \n The British Library\u2019s hypothesis was unlikely to settle any debates. The article noted there were several limitations to the arsenic theory. The premise that Austen required glasses of such unusual strength could be flawed. It was possible that a physician did not prescribe Austen the increasingly strong lenses, and the writer simply purchased them. \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t be completely sure that she wore them at all,\u201d Tuppen pointed out. \u201cHowever, we are keen to publish these test results in the hope that other eye specialists will share their ideas and opinions with us.\u201d \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n Harvard theorists: How sailing aliens could have caused fast radio bursts \n \n A Mendelssohn masterpiece was really his sister\u2019s.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The cause of Jane Austen's death at age 41 in 1817 has been an enduring mystery of the literary world. The legendary author's own letters complain of ill health, and experts have used them to suggest a number of possible culprits, from stomach cancer to Hodgkin's lymphoma, the Washington Post reports. Now, a trio of eyeglasses found in Austen's desk could hold a more intriguing answer. The spectacles of increasing strength indicate Austen suffered from progressive eye problems; indeed, the Pride and Prejudice author notes her \"weak\" eyes in her missives. Austen may have suffered from an underlying health problem that attacked her vision, writes British Library curator Sandra Tuppen, who theorizes slow-growing cataracts might have been caused by accidental arsenic poisoning. The toxic metal was common in 19th-century England, tainting medicine, water, and even wallpaper. Other causes such as diabetes would have killed Austen more quickly, says Tuppen. The debate over Austen's death dates back to 1964, when an English doctor argued the culprit was the adrenal disorder Addison's disease. Then crime writer Lindsay Ashford floated the arsenic theory in a 2011 novel, citing the skin discoloration that Austin notes late in her life. \"I think it\u2019s highly likely she was given a medicine containing arsenic,\" says Ashford. \"When you look at her list of symptoms and compare them to the list of arsenic symptoms, there is an amazing correlation.\" But Austen scholar Janine Barchas, who has her own forthcoming report on the glasses, calls the arsenic theory \"reckless,\" per the New York Times. \"We look forward to further discussions and debate on this topic,\" writes Tuppen.

If Austen did develop cataracts, \u2013 Jane Austen may have had arsenic in her system when she died\u2014but she didn't kill herself, suggests a new study in Modern Philology. The study's lead author, Janine Barchas of the University of Texas at Austin, tested three pairs of glasses belonging to the late English author and found that they varied in their strength based on the amount of arsenic they contained, reports the BBC. Austen wrote that she suffered from \"unusual facial pigmentation\" at the end of her life, and the study suggests that she may have been poisoned by a chemical found in her blood. \"The variations in the strength of the [three] pairs of spectacles may indeed give further credence to the theory that Austen suffered from arsenic poisoning, albeit accidental,\" says the lead author in a press release from the British Library, where Austen's glasses are on display. (Click to read about another new theory about Austen.) \u2013 A pair of glasses found in Jane Austen's writing desk at the British Library may shed light on the mystery of the beloved author's 1817 death. Austen complained of bilious attacks, fever, and facial aches in her later letters, and experts have suggested stomach cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or an adrenal disorder known as Addison's disease could have been behind her death at age 41, the Washington Post reports. The British Library's theory: Austen died from arsenic poisoning, likely from a tainted water supply or medicinal mix-up, the library says. The theory has been met with skepticism, the Post notes, since the library published an article on its website last week suggesting Austen may have cataracts. \u2013 Jane Austen died of arsenic poisoning, right? Wrong, according to the British Library, which says the Sense and Sensibility author may have been poisoned by a tainted water supply or a medicinal mix-up, the New York Times reports. The library published an article on its website Thursday claiming that a desk donated to the library in 1999 by Austen's great-great- great-niece contained three pairs of glasses\u2014two tortoiseshell glasses and one wire-framed\u2014which may have contributed to the author's deteriorating eyesight. \"Could it be that she gradually needed stronger and stronger glasses for reading because of a more serious underlying health problem?\" wrote a curator at the library. \"The variations in the strength of the British library's three pair of spectacles may indeed give further credence to the theory.\" Austen complained of skin discoloration and cataracts in the 1800s, and a British candy seller in 1858 poisoned 25 and poisoned more than 100 others when he accidentally added arsenic to his peppermint sweets. arsenic was present in \"beer, wine, sweets, wrapping paper, painted toys, sheep dip, insecticides, clothing, dead bodies, stuffed animals, hat ornaments, coal and candles,\" according to Distillations magazine, which also notes that green wallpaper and green dresses contained arsenic. \u2013 Ever since Jane Austen died at the age of 41 in 1813, there's been plenty of debate as to what killed the author of Pride and Prejudice: Addison's disease, an immune deficiency, fatal lymphoma, arsenic, etc. Now, the British Library is reporting in the journal PLOS ONE that Austen's eyes may have played a role. A team led by Dr. Martin Wilson of the University of Southampton's School of Ophthalmology conducted a series of tests on a pair of glasses Austen was said to have purchased in the months before her death and found that they were significantly stronger than those she was known to have worn, reports the Washington Post. Wilson says the strong lenses may have been a result of the special contact lenses Austen was using at the time, which were made of a \"super-strong\" material that allowed them to be up to 10 times stronger than the typical contact lenses. He says Austen may have worn the glasses for up to a year before dying of arsenic poisoning, which he believes was the cause of her death. But he says the lenses may not have been prescribed to Austen by a physician, or she may have simply purchased them herself. \"We can't be completely sure that she wore them at all,\" he says. \"",

Passengers travel their full journey, through the air and on the ground without having to switch vehicles along the way. \n \n The TF-2 will take-off like a helicopter, fly like an airplane, and drive on the roads using the latest technology in electric propulsion, construction materials and manufacturing processes to ensure safety and reliability. ||||| The Transition was designed as a \"light sport\" aircraft, the smallest kind of private aeroplane under FAA classification, with a maximum weight of 1,320lb. But the manufacturers found it impossible to fit the safety features - airbags, crumple zones and roll cage, for instance - that are required for road vehicles into that weight. \n \n Uniquely, however, the FAA has granted the Transition an exemption - allowing it to be classified as a light sport aircraft despite being 120lb over the limit. \n \n The two-seater Transition can use its front-wheel drive on roads at ordinary highway speeds, with wings folded, at a respectable 30 miles per gallon.

Tabor Reservoir system tested clean of urine-related toxins Thursday, news that came as no surprise to Water Bureau administrators yet also did not change their decision to dump 38 million gallons after a man peed in the Southeast Portland storage pool a day earlier. \n \n City leaders said they were going ahead with plans to drain the water in Reservoir 5 to ensure no health risks to Portland water customers. The decision to empty and clean the reservoir has drawn mention of Portland -- much of it disbelieving or out-and-out derisive -- by national and international news media. \n \n The chief point of contention: Reservoir 5 can hold up to 50 million gallons of water. The typical adult human bladder can hold two or so cups of urine. So the possibility someone getting sick because of Wednesday morning\u2019s incident is, as Water Bureau officials acknowledge, slight at best. \n \n \u201cFrom a public health protection standpoint, it\u2019s not necessary to get rid of the water,\u201d said Anna Harding, co-director of the School of Biological and Population Health Sciences at Oregon State University. \u201cThe urine, which has very few microorganisms to begin with, would be very, very, very, very diluted.\u201d \n \n Still, city officials say, any risk is too much. \n \n \u201cThe professionals told me this is the way to go. I\u2019m following their advice. We\u2019ve got plenty of water, so we will go ahead and take the safest course,\u201d said City Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the utility. \u201cPeople can feel free to second guess, but this is not a debate. This is the best public health decision.\u201d \n \n The second-guessing came from far and wide Thursday, including the leading advocate of a May ballot measure to switch control of the city\u2019s water away from the City Council to an independently elected water district board. \n \n Kent Craford, a former lobbyist for large industrial water customers and co-petitioner of the ballot measure, said he thinks flushing 38 million gallons is a bad idea. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a public relations decision,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u2019t waste all that water, all that money.\u201d \n \n Craford would not speculate whether the water board he\u2019s proposing would feel the same. \n \n \u201cThat would be up to the board, up to the managers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur belief is that a water district board will make better decisions than the City Council, and that they would ensure better management than what we have right now.\u201d \n \n The debate about dumping or keeping the water is uniquely Portland with roots in the city\u2019s multi-year battle against new federal mandates on open-air reservoirs. Portland leaders opted to stop fighting last year, and Mt. Tabor\u2019s open reservoir system must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The open-air reservoir at Washington Park must go offline by the end of 2016. \n \n \u201cPolitics had no impact on our decision in this case,\u201d Fish said. \u201cBut this is Mt.

I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be pissed about that?\u201d \n \n Instead, Delynn said he urinated on the wall next to Reservoir 5. \n \n Delynn and two friends were given written citations for trespassing \u2013 Delynn also was written up for urinating somewhere other than a park bathroom \u2013 and barred from Mt. Tabor for 30 days. Portland Water Bureau officials are working with the Multnomah County District Attorney to determine whether there are criminal charges to be filed. \n \n \n \n Delynn also told Kavanaugh he thinks it's silly to flush 38 million gallons of water: \n \n \"Like, how they can do that?\u201d says Delynn. \u201cHow can they be like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re gonna flush all that water.\u2019 Dude, I\u2019ve seen dead birds in there.

Or 304 million tallboy cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. \n \n \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fucking retarded dude,\u201d Swonger says. \n \n In an exclusive, expletive-filled interview with Vocativ outside his mother\u2019s home Thursday, the 18-year-old insisted that his piss never trickled into Portland\u2019s drinking supply. He also lamented the looming reality that this story will make him a national (and international) laughing stock. \n \n \u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s funny and a joke and I\u2019m going to be on the news,\u201d he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. \u201cIt\u2019s no fuckin\u2019 joke, dude.

I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be pissed about that?\u201d \n \n The night that launched the whiz-seen-round-the-world had started off on a more feel-good note for Swonger. He says he had moved back to town that very day from St. Helens, which is 30 miles north of Portland, where he had been living with his dad. Eager to shred with some friends, he and two buddies went to skateboard at Mount Tabor Park after hours, which is home to three of the city\u2019s five uncovered drinking water reservoirs \u2013 and a handful of excellent hill runs. After bombing down the park\u2019s western slope, nature began to call Swonger. It was around 1 a.m. and the three friends, along with two other people they met in the park, were near one of the reservoirs. \n \n \u201cI was like, \u2018Dudes I have to piss so bad,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSo I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir].\u201d \n \n \u201cI leaned up against the wall and pissed on it,\u201d he says. \u201cRight there on the wall, dude. I don\u2019t know else how to describe it.\u201d \n \n Water Bureau officials, however, insist Swonger took a leek in the drink. \u201cWhen you see the video, he\u2019s leaning right up because he has to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars,\u201d bureau administrator Davd Shaff told the Oregonian. \u201cThere\u2019s really no doubt what he\u2019s doing.\u201d \n \n Water Bureau security and Portland Police officers later stopped Swonger and his two friends, identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald, and cited all three with trespassing. Swonger was also cited for public urination. \n \n While human pee is not a health hazard \u2013 and scores of animals piss, shit and die in Mount Tabor\u2019s reservoirs every year \u2013 the city says it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results on Thursday showed no signs of water contamination. \n \n \u201cLike, how they can do that?\u201d says Swonger. \u201cHow can they be like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re gonna flush all that water.\u2019 Dude, I\u2019ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I\u2019ve see hella dead animals in there. Like dead squirrels and shit. I mean, really, dude?\u201d \n \n Yes, really. In 2011, city officials flushed 7.8 million gallons of reservoir water from Mount Tabor after another man decided to unzip and rip. The Water Bureau also says that it intends to pursue additional charges against Swonger. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mount Tabor Reservoir: The city is flushing 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain because it says Dallas peed in the open reservoir.

The UK and US share a vast amount of information about terror and espionage threats - it is a tight-knit network that also encompasses Canada, Australia and New Zealand. \n \n That system is based on trust and the \"control principle\": if a piece of intelligence is shared, the receiving nation has no right to further disseminate it without permission. \n \n The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council described the \"unauthorised disclosure\" as a breach of trust which had potentially undermined a \"major counter-terrorism investigation\". \n \n Counter-terrorism detectives have spoken in the past about how a delay of about 36 hours before the public know who is being investigated can allow known associates of the suspect to be arrested without being tipped off. \n \n Lord Blair, who was the head of the Metropolitan Police at the time of the bombings in London on 7 July 2005, said a similar leak had happened then. \n \n \"It's a different world in which the US operate in terms of how they publish things and this is a very grievous breach but I'm afraid it's the same as before,\" he said. \n \n Image caption Abedi's father, Ramadan, was held in Tripoli \n \n What's happening with the investigation? \n \n Eight men have been arrested in the UK since Monday night, including Abedi's older brother Ismail, 23. \n \n Abedi's younger brother Hashem, 20, was held by special forces linked to the interior ministry in the Libyan capital Tripoli, as was their father. \n \n Speaking on Wednesday, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: \"It's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating.\" \n \n As part of their investigation, raids involving controlled explosions have been carried out at a block of flats near Manchester Piccadilly station in the city centre on Wednesday and at an address in the Moss Side area of Manchester in the early hours of Thursday. \n \n Anyone with information can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321. \n \n Who are the victims? \n \n Image caption From left: Courtney Boyle, Elaine McIver and Eilidh MacLeod \n \n Abedi detonated his \"nuts-and-bolts\" bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande gig as children, teenagers and others were making their way out of Manchester Arena. \n \n Others, including parents, were waiting in the foyer to pick up family and friends when the bomb went off. \n \n The youngest so far known to have died is eight-year-old Saffie Roussos.

(Associated Press) \n \n Undated handout photo from an unnamed source made available on Wednesday May 24, 2017 of Salman Abedi. ??British authorities identified Salman Abedi as the bomber who was responsible for Monday's explosion in Manchester which killed more than 20 people. (AP) (Associated Press) \n \n MANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Security forces rounded up more suspects Wednesday in the deadly Manchester concert blast and soldiers fanned out across the country to national landmarks as an on-edge Britain tried to thwart the possibility of additional attacks. \n \n Officials scoured the background of the British-born ethnic Libyan identified as the bomber, saying he was likely part of a wider terrorist network. Additional arrests were made both in Britain and in Libya in the bombing that killed 22 people and wounded scores more. \n \n Among those taken into custody in Libya were the suspected bomber's father and his younger brother, the latter of whom confessed to knowing \"all the details\" of the attack plot, Libyan anti-terror authorities said. \n \n \"I think it's very clear this is a network we are investigating,\" Chief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Manchester Police said as authorities raided British properties thought to be connected to Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old suspected bomber who grew up in Manchester and died in the attack. \n \n British Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Abedi \"likely\" did not act alone in the strike at the close of an Ariana Grande concert Monday night and that he had been known to security forces \"up to a point.\" Meanwhile, officials probed possible travel by the alleged bomber, looking for clues to new threats. \n \n Government officials said nearly 1,000 soldiers were deployed to Buckingham Palace, Parliament and other high-profile sites across the country. Britain's terror threat level was raised to \"critical\" \u2014 the highest level \u2014 on Tuesday over concern another attack could be imminent. \n \n French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said Abedi was believed to have traveled to Syria and had \"proven\" links to the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the attack. British officials, however, have not commented on whether Abedi had links to IS or other extremist groups. \n \n British authorities were probing whether Abedi had ties to other cells across Europe and North Africa, according to two officials familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the ongoing investigation. \n \n They said one thread of the inquiry involved pursuing whether Abedi was part of a larger terror cell that included Mohamed Abrini, otherwise known as \"the man in the hat,\" with connections to the Brussels and Paris attacks. Abrini visited Manchester in 2015. \n \n \"It looks like we're not dealing with a lone wolf situation. There's a network \u2014 a cell of ISIS-inspired terrorists,\" said U.S. Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He said the bomb's construction suggested a \"level of sophistication\" that might indicate foreign training. \n \n Six additional arrests were made in Britain on Wednesday as the sprawling investigation extended to Libya, where Abedi's father and 18-year-old brother were detained in Tripoli. The father, Ramadan Abedi, denied his son had links to militants in an interview with The Associated Press before he was taken into custody, saying, \"We don't believe in killing innocents.\" \n \n The elder Abedi was allegedly a member of the al-Qaida-backed Libyan Islamic Fighting group in the 1990s, according to a former Libyan security official, Abdel-Basit Haroun. \n \n The Libyan anti-terror force that arrested the men said in a statement that the brother, Hashim Abedi, 18, confessed that he and his brother were linked to the Islamic State group and that he was aware of the arena bombing plan. The anti-terror force said the father had not been charged, but was taken in for questioning. \n \n A second brother, Ismail Abedi, 23, was taken into custody in Manchester a day earlier. \n \n The suspected bomber grew up in Manchester's southern suburbs and once attended Salford University there. Neighbors recalled him as tall, thin and quiet, and said he often wore traditional Islamic dress. Among investigators' areas of interest is how often Abedi traveled to Libya, which has seen an eruption of armed Islamist groups since dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed in 2011. \n \n Before his arrest, Abedi's father said he had last spoken to his son five days ago and he sounded \"normal.\" He said his son was getting ready to visit Saudi Arabia for a short Umrah pilgrimage then planned to head to Libya to spend the Islamic holy month of Ramadan with his family. He said his son last visited Libya about six weeks ago and had never gone to Syria. He denied ties to any militant groups or suggestions of extremism. \n \n \"We aren't the ones who blow up ourselves among innocents,\" he said. \"We go to mosques. We recite Quran, but not that.\" \n \n At Manchester's Didsbury Mosque, where the Abedi family worshipped, the bombing was condemned and reports that the suspected bomber had worked there were denied. Azhar Mahmoud, who prays at the mosque in southern Manchester, said it was \"horrible\" that Abedi was associated with it. \n \n \"Wherever he got that, he didn't get it from this mosque,\" he said, adding that the imam regularly preached against radicalization. \n \n British Prime Minister Theresa May chaired a meeting Wednesday of her emergency security cabinet group to talk about intelligence reports on Abedi and concerns that he might have had outside support. Police raided homes believed to be connected with the investigation. \n \n At one apartment building in Manchester, heavily armed police swarmed in and a controlled explosion was heard. At another property, a house a 10-minute walk from where Abedi lived, neighbors said they were awakened by a loud noise and saw a man hauled away in handcuffs. \n \n \"There was a policeman, armed policeman, shouting,\" neighbor Omar Alfa Khuri said. \"And I realized there is something wrong here.\" \n \n Across London, troops fanned out and authorities reconsidered security plans. The changing of the guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace was canceled so police officers could be re-deployed. The Palace of Westminster, which houses Parliament, was shuttered to those without passes, and tours and events were canceled until further notice. Armed police patrolled outside St. Paul's Cathedral in London, another popular tourist spot. \n \n For a second night, a throng of people filled a Manchester square for a vigil for the victims. Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders echoed a message that extremists wouldn't drive a wedge among the city's religious groups. People lifted their hands in the air during a moment of silence. \n \n \"There are no divisions here tonight,\" Irfan Chishti, the imam of Manchester's biggest mosque, told the crowd. \n \n Officials said all of the bombing victims have been identified, but names were being withheld until autopsies were completed. \n \n Still, their stories began to emerge: Michelle Kiss, a mother of three whose \"family was her life;\" Nell Jones, an \"always smiling\" teenager; Martyn Hett, who packed life \"to the brim with his passions;\" Jane Tweddle, a \"bubbly, kind, welcoming\" receptionist.

They, too, have now been arrested. \n \n CCTV footage also appears to place Abedi at Manchester's Arndale shopping centre at around 8pm on Friday. \n \n Images show a man with a backpack similar to the one pictured blown to shreds in photos leaked to US media. \n \n The pictures are said to have caused fury among police and security services, with Theresa May to raise the issue with Donald Trump at the NATO summit, and some intelligence sharing put on pause. \n \n The night of his attack, Abedi stayed in a \u00a375-per-night flat close to the arena. \n \n Image: CCTV from the Arndale is thought to show Abedi with the backpack \n \n Image: Pictures published in the US appearing to show remnants of the backpack \n \n Police have said it is \"very clear\" there is a \"terror network\" that is likely to have helped the Manchester-born attacker. \n \n Sky News has found Abedi had links to an Islamic State cell which operated in the city, and knew one of the terror group's most prolific recruiters. \n \n The sophistication of Abedi's device has led to concerns a bomb maker could still be at large. \n \n Police searched a semi-detached house in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, overnight, after a man was arrested there on Wednesday. \n \n Neighbours said a Libyan-born father-of-five named named Naser Elshetwi lived at the house, but the identity of the person arrested has not been confirmed. \n \n Police in balaclavas also mounted an early-morning raid at a house in Manchester's Moss Side, using a controlled explosion to gain entry. No arrests were reported by police. \n \n There was another overnight raid on a flat in the city's Withington area - where one man was arrested. \n \n 1:49 Video: Salman Abedi and the Manchester terror cell \n \n Neighbours said a man and woman lived there with three children. One resident in the street told reporters she had spoken to the woman, who said she was from Libya. \n \n :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack \n \n Meanwhile, Abedi's father and brother have also been detained in Libya. \n \n Ramadan Abedi, and 20-year-old Hashem Abedi were arrested in capital, Tripoli. \n \n Authorities say Hashem was preparing his own attack in the city and knew about his brother's plot. \n \n When arrested he is reported to have said: \"I have ideology with my brother... I know everything about my brother, what he was doing there in Manchester.\" ||||| BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday that \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d leaks to U.S. media about the Manchester suicide bombing would be investigated, after irate British police briefly stopped sharing information with U.S. agencies. \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump (L) and Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May react during a ceremony at the new NATO headquarters before the start of a summit in Brussels, Belgium, May 25, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann \n \n Prime Minister Theresa May raised British concerns with Trump at a NATO summit in Brussels, telling him intelligence shared between their two countries had to remain secure, in a rare public show of dissatisfaction with Britain\u2019s closest security ally. \n \n After a suspension that lasted about a day, Britain\u2019s most senior counter terrorism officer said late on Thursday that the police had resumed sharing information with the United States after receiving \u201cfresh assurances\u201d. \n \n Trump had called the leaks \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d. \n \n \u201cI am asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter, and if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d he said in a statement released after his arrival in Brussels. \n \n The row comes as British police stepped up their investigation into a suspected network behind Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old British-born man with Libyan parents who blew himself up on Monday night at the Manchester Arena indoor venue after a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande \n \n The singer\u2019s fans are mostly children and teenagers and the explosion killed 22 people, ranging from an eight-year-old schoolgirl to parents who had come to pick up their children. \n \n Police are holding eight people in custody in connection with the attack and bomb disposal units were used in searches as officers raided properties across the city. \n \n In the nearby town of Wigan, where a man was arrested on Wednesday, police said they had discovered potentially suspicious items, prompting them to bring in the bomb squad and evacuate properties in the area. The security alert was later lifted. \n \n Police said they were making good progress. \n \n \u201cI want to reassure people that the arrests that we have made are significant, and initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation,\u201d Manchester\u2019s police chief Ian Hopkins said. \n \n With the official threat level raised to \u201ccritical\u201d, meaning a further attack could be imminent, troops have been deployed to free up police, and armed officers patrolled trains for the first time in Britain. \n \n The state-run National Health Service said all 27 major trauma units in England had told staff to be prepared for a possible attack, ahead of the weekend and a public holiday on Monday. \n \n BOMB-MAKER? \n \n Abedi had recently returned from Libya, where his father and younger brother were arrested by a militia on Wednesday. \n \n Abedi passed through Istanbul on his way to Europe, Turkish security officials told Reuters, but said there were no records of him entering Syria during his travels as had been suggested on Wednesday by the French interior minister. [L8N1IR4RV] \n \n A source with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters Abedi might have made the bomb himself or with some assistance from an accomplice. That was a change from previous thinking that a bomb-maker might be at large. \n \n \u201cThe focus is still the search for accomplices and the network but he could have made this bomb himself,\u201d the source said. \n \n Over the past three days, several key details of the investigation, including the name of the bomber, first came out in U.S. media, angering British police who feared such leaks risked compromising their investigation. \n \n May raised the matter with Trump as they gathered for a group photograph at the NATO summit. \n \n \u201cShe expressed the view that the intelligence sharing relationship we have with the U.S. is hugely important and valuable, but that the information that we share should be kept secure,\u201d a British government source said. \n \n U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also spoke to Britain\u2019s interior minister Amber Rudd about the issue. The U.S. Justice Department said it had initiated steps to address the \u201crampant leaks\u201d, which it said could not be tolerated. \n \n The decision to stop sharing police information with U.S. agencies was an extraordinary step for Britain, which is usually at pains to emphasize its \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States. \n \n \u201cWhile we do not usually comment on information sharing arrangements ... having received fresh assurances, we are now working closely with our key partners around the world,\u201d said Mark Rowley, Britain\u2019s lead officer for counter-terrorism policing. \n \n British authorities did not say the investigation had in fact been compromised by the leaks. \n \n The attack injured 116 people, of whom 75 were admitted to hospital and 23 remain in a very serious condition, health authorities said. \n \n Queen Elizabeth visited the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital, where some of the casualties have been treated, and was filmed chatting with a girl lying injured on a ward. She described the attack as \u201cvery wicked\u201d. \n \n \u201cA CITY UNITED\u201d \n \n A minute\u2019s silence was observed in honor of the victims at a square in central Manchester, after which crowds broke into an emotional chorus of \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back in Anger\u201d, an old hit song by the band Oasis who are from the city. \n \n The city\u2019s two giant soccer clubs, Manchester United and Manchester City, laid aside their rivalry to jointly donate 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) to an emergency fund set up to support families affected by the attack. They labeled their initiative \u201cA City United\u201d. \n \n The bombing has caused revulsion across the world for targeting children and teenagers. Former U.S. President Barack Obama, meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel at an event in Berlin, said the pair were \u201cheartbroken\u201d, while Trump told fellow NATO leaders the attack was \u201csavage\u201d and \u201cbarbaric\u201d. \n \n Many European cities, including Paris, Berlin and Brussels, have suffered attacks in the past two years, underlining the importance of confidential intelligence cooperation. \n \n Britain routinely shares intelligence with the United States bilaterally, and as part of the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d network which also includes Australia, Canada and New Zealand. \n \n Trump was widely criticized this month after it emerged he had discussed sensitive Syria-related intelligence, originating from an ally, with Russian officials at a White House meeting. May said at the time Britain would continue to share information with Washington. \n \n Pictures published by the New York Times included remains of the bomb and of the rucksack carried by the suicide bomber, and showed blood stains amid the wreckage. \n \n \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty disgusting,\u201d said Scott Lightfoot, a Manchester resident, speaking outside a train station in the city. He criticized media for publishing such material. \n \n Slideshow (8 Images) \n \n \u201cWho\u2019s leaking it? Where\u2019s it coming from? This is British intelligence at the end of the day, people shouldn\u2019t be finding out about this.\u201d \n \n In a statement, the New York Times defended its decision to publish the images, saying they were \u201cneither graphic nor disrespectful of victims\u201d. \n \n \u201cOur coverage of Monday\u2019s horrific attack has been both comprehensive and responsible,\u201d the newspaper said. ||||| A \"vivacious\" teenager from the picturesque Scottish island of Barra has been confirmed dead by her parents. \n \n Eilidh MacLeod, 14, was killed in the blast at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on Monday evening, which she attended with her close friend Laura MacIntyre, 15, who was located in hospital nearly 20 hours after the incident. \n \n Ms MacIntyre's parents have said in a statement that their daughter is in a critical condition. \n \n They said: \"Our daughter Laura is a funny and witty young girl who excels at everything she does. \n \n \"Laura and her friend Eilidh were so looking forward to the concert, but the night has now ended in a tragedy where Eilidh has now lost her life and Laura is in a critical condition. ||||| British police have stopped sharing evidence from the investigation into the terror network behind the Manchester bombing with the United States after a series of leaks left investigators and the government furious. \n \n The ban is limited to the Manchester investigation only. British police believe the leaks are unprecedented in their scope, frequency and potential damage. \n \n Downing Street was not behind the decision by Greater Manchester police to stop sharing information with US intelligence, a No 10 source said, stressing that it was important police were allowed to take independent decisions. \n \n \u201cThis is an operational matter for police,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said. The police and the Home Office refused to comment. The Guardian understands there is not a blanket ban on intelligence-sharing between the US and the UK. \n \n Photographs of Manchester bomb parts published after leak Read more \n \n Relations between the US and UK security services, normally extremely close, have been put under strain by the scale of the leaks from US officials to the American media. \n \n After chairing a meeting of the emergency Cobra meeting Theresa May said: \u201cI will make clear to President Trump that intelligence shared between our security agencies must remain secure.\u201d She is due to meet the US president at a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. \n \n Ahead of the summit, the prime minister said she would work with other leaders on the global effort to defeat terrorism and remove extremist material from the internet. \n \n \n \n She said the domestic threat of terrorism is still at a critical level, meaning an attack may be imminent, and she urged the public to remain vigilant. \n \n On Friday, the prime minister will attend a G7 summit in Taormina in Sicily, although her planned attendance is being cut short by a day because of the higher domestic terror threat level. \n \n \n \n The prime minister said she will \u201clead a discussion on counter-terrorism and on how we will work together to prevent the plotting of terrorist attacks online and to stop the spread of hateful extremist ideology on social media\u201d. \n \n British officials were infuriated on Wednesday when the New York Times published forensic photographs of sophisticated bomb parts that UK authorities fear could complicate the expanding investigation, in which six further arrests have been made in the UK and two more in Libya. \n \n It was the latest of a series of leaks to US journalists that appeared to come from inside the US intelligence community, passing on data that had been shared between the two countries as part of longstanding security cooperation. \n \n A senior Whitehall source said: \u201cThese images from inside the American system are clearly distressing to victims, their families and other members of the public. Protests have been lodged at every relevant level between the British authorities and our US counterparts. They are in no doubt about our huge strength of feeling on this issue. It is unacceptable.\u201d \n \n Whitehall sources reported a sense of deflation among UK security staff at the amount of detail coming out of America. The UK had shared the material with US police and intelligence in the expectation it would remain secret. The amount released is hampering at least part of the investigation, they believe. \n \n \n \n Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, said the leaks were arrogant and disrespectful, and police chiefs also criticised the actions. \n \n A national counter-terrorism policing spokesperson said: \u201cWe greatly value the important relationships we have with our trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world. \n \n \u201cWhen that trust is breached it undermines these relationships, and undermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families. This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorised disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counter-terrorism investigation.\u201d \n \n The police and the domestic security agency, MI5, are facing questions over whether they ignored warnings about Salman Abedi and whether there were clues they failed to pick up on. \n \n While not directly responding to the criticism, the agencies have stressed that they have a large number of potential suspects and, in spite of increased spending, do not have infinite resources to monitor everyone. Hard decisions have to be made about prioritising which suspects need to be put under physical and electronic surveillance, they have said. \n \n The number of specialist personnel carrying out physical surveillance varies according to whether a suspect is being watched at home or in the outside world. \n \n MI5 is reticent about releasing exact figures but it has a database of about 3,000 potential people of concern, of whom about 500 are regarded as potentially high risk. Only a small proportion of these can be put under 24-hour physical surveillance and often only for a limited number of days or weeks. \n \n The ban on sharing information with the US on such a major inquiry is unprecedented, more so because the atrocity has potential implications for US efforts to prevent any similar attacks directed at American targets. \n \n The ban is described as temporary, and British police are examining if they can put safeguards in place to stop any further leaks. \n \n British police are angry that as their officers are in pursuit of a suspected terror network, with raids deemed so risky they are being carried out by elite armed officers, sensitive information is being regularly leaked by the US. \n \n May will raise her concerns with the US president at the Nato summit, where she will push for the military alliance to join the coalition against Islamic State. \n \n The images published by the New York Times revealed that the device used by Salman Abedi, which killed 22 people, had been made with \u201cforethought and care\u201d, raising questions for investigators about how it had been constructed and by whom. \n \n Abedi had carried a metal box containing \u201cwell packed\u201d explosives, metal nuts and screws in a box probably inside a Karrimor rucksack, the leaked details showed. The device was powerful enough for shrapnel to penetrate metal doors and to scar brick walls. Abedi detonated the bomb with his left hand. \n \n It showed the force of the explosion was such that his torso was ripped from the rest of his body and propelled across the foyer and that most of those killed were in a circle around the bomber. \n \n The kind of information that has been leaked is routinely shared with police counterparts in the US. The information goes into a shared computer system and is then distributed among different specialists in the US, ranging from bomb experts to those dealing in counter-terrorism. \n \n The UK and US are among the closest intelligence partners in the world, with the UK\u2019s surveillance agency, GCHQ, sharing information with the NSA, MI6 with the CIA, and MI5 with the FBI. But the lines are not rigid and information is often shared more widely. \n \n On Wednesday Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, had rebuked the US security services for leaking the bomber\u2019s name to American media before it had been made public in Britain, but her warnings appear to have had no impact. \n \n \u201cI have been very clear with our friends that that should not happen again,\u201d Rudd said. \n \n Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, was asked about the leaks by reporters in Brussels before Thursday\u2019s meeting of Nato leaders. \n \n He said: \u201cSharing intelligence is of great importance. Sharing intelligence is based on trust and we have seen in Nato over many, many years that we have been able to share intelligence in a good way and that has been of great importance to the alliance and for all allies.\u201d \n \n Stoltenberg said he was unable to comment further as he \u201cdid not know what actually happened\u201d. He added that it was a bilateral issue between the US and the UK. \n \n Ian Blair, who was Metropolitan police commissioner during the London underground bombings on 7 July 2005, said his investigation had also been troubled by leaks from US intelligence. \n \n Blair said he was sure the leaks had \u201cnothing to do with Trump\u201d given that similar leaks had happened during his own time investigating a terror attack. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m afraid this reminds me exactly of what happened after 7/7, when the US published a complete picture of the way the bombs had been made up. We had the same protests. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a different world in how the US operates in the sense of how they publish things. And this is a very grievous breach but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s the same as before.\u201d \n \n Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, described the leaks as \u201cvery unusual and irresponsible\u201d and called for those responsible to be \u201ccalled to account\u201d. \n \n He said: \u201cPhotos of the backpack after the event could be of utility to future bombmakers, for obvious reasons. Also, it damages decades of confidence between the UK and US services, the cohesion of the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 group [the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand], and sharing of information with French, German and other security services. These leaks made yesterday a very bad day for national security in several countries, and those responsible should be called to account.\u201d ||||| The bomber in the Manchester terrorist attack appeared to have carried a powerful explosive in a lightweight metal container concealed either within a black vest or a blue Karrimor backpack, and may have held a small switch in his left hand, according to preliminary information gathered by British authorities. \n \n Remnants of backpack \n \n The initial analysis of the bomb, based on evidence photographed and collected at the crime scene and distributed by British authorities, does not specify the size or type of explosive used in the bomb\u2019s main charge but suggests an improvised device made with forethought and care. \n \n Possible switch located in suspect\u2019s left hand \n \n Law enforcement images of metal nuts and screws propelled by the blast, and of damage nearby, show that the bomb\u2019s makeshift shrapnel penetrated metal doors and left deep scuffs in brick walls. \n \n Nuts and screws used as shrapnel \n \n And the authorities\u2019 review of the blast site shows that many of the fatalities occurred in a nearly complete circle around the bomber, Salman Abedi, whose upper torso was heaved outside the lethal ring toward the Manchester Arena entrance. \n \n Manchester Arena Torso of bomber Box office Doors to arena Victims Foyer Approx. location of detonation Bridge to Victoria Station Manchester Arena Torso of bomber Box office Doors to arena Victims Foyer Approx. location of detonation Bridge to Victoria Station Manchester Arena Torso of bomber Box office Doors to arena Victims Foyer Approx. location of detonation Bridge to Victoria Station The New York Times \n \n All of these are indicators of a powerful, high-velocity charge, and of a bomb in which its shrapnel was carefully and evenly packed. \n \n The location of the bomber\u2019s torso, and the apparent absence of fatalities in a line between the blast site and where his remains landed, was said by one explosive disposal technician who examined the images to indicate that the explosive charge was more likely in a backpack than in a vest, and propelled the bomber away from the blast. \n \n Manchester Arena Exit Stage Exit Exit Parking Exit Blast area People seen running down these stairs in video. Victoria Station Train tracks Manchester Arena Exit Stage Exit Exit Exit Blast area Victoria Station Train tracks The New York Times \n \n Certain details of the bomb further suggest a desire by a bomb-maker to reduce the risk of a dud. \n \n The authorities found a mangled Yuasa 12-volt, 2.1 amp-hour lead acid battery at the scene, which is more powerful than batteries often seen in backpack bombs or suicide vests. The battery, used for emergency lighting and other applications, can be bought for about $20. \n \n 12-volt battery that was possible power source \n \n A possible switch to initiate the explosion, carried in the bomber\u2019s left hand, was also unusual in a suicide device, in that it appears to have contained a small circuit board soldered inside one end. \n \n It is not clear from the law enforcement images if the object was a simple plunger switch, or included a timer or a receiver that could be operated remotely via radio signal \u2013 or some combination, or something else. \n \n Such redundancy, if the object was the switch, could give the bomber or a cell more than one option for deploying the device, and suggest that the bomb was not as simple in design as many terrorist devices, which often are crude and prone to failure or haphazard effect. \n \n One independent analyst of improvised explosive devices, Michael C.L. Johnson, suggested that the object might be an electronic cigarette and unrelated to the bomb\u2019s detonation \u2013 an understandable case of investigators focusing on a crime-scene detail early in a case.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Police in Britain, angered by repeated leaks of sensitive information, have decided to stop sharing information on the Manchester terrorist attack with American authorities. The decision came after photographs believed to show bomb debris appeared in a New York Times report, sources tell the BBC, which calls the step a \"hugely significant\" move that shows just how angry British authorities are about leaks that could hinder the investigation. Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to raise the issue with President Trump at a NATO meeting Thursday, though the leaks are believed to have come from US law enforcement agencies, not the White House. In other coverage: The Times report that infuriated British police has photos of the remains of a backpack and a battery found at the scene, along with detailed analysis of the blast site. Analysts say the bomb, powerful enough to embed shrapnel in metal walls, appears to have been made with \"forethought and care.\" Two more men in Britain have been arrested in connection with the Monday night attack, bringing the number of people in custody to eight, including one woman, reports Reuters. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi's father and brother have been detained in Libya. British authorities say the leaking of information provided under a long-standing cooperation deal is unacceptable. \"These images from inside the American system are clearly distressing to victims, their families, and other members of the public,\" a government source tells the Guardian. \"Protests have been lodged at every relevant level between the British authorities and our US counterparts.\" Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, says the device detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert shows a \"level of sophistication\" that suggests the involvement of foreign terror cells, the AP reports. \"It looks like we're not dealing with a lone wolf situation. There's a network\u2014a cell of ISIS-inspired terrorists,\" the Republican says. Sky News reports that German intelligence services say Abedi was in the country around four days before the Manchester attack. Security camera footage obtained by Sky shows a man suspected to be Abedi in Manchester's Arndale shopping center on Friday with what may be the backpack used in the bombing. One of the latest of the 22 victims to be identified is 14-year-old Eilidh MacLeod, who had traveled from the Scottish island of Barra to Manchester with her mother and a friend for the concert, the Telegraph reports. \"Eilidh was vivacious and full of fun. She loved all music, whether it was listening to Ariana or playing the bagpipes with her pipe band,\" her family said in a statement.",

(Photo: Peter Schneider, EPA) \n \n GENEVA, Switzerland \u2014 Chalk it up to Swiss affluence. Voters here will decide next month whether all 8 million citizens and legal residents should be guaranteed a generous monthly income, something no country in the world has ever done. \n \n On June 5, Swiss voters will weigh in on a radical proposal that would mandate the government to guarantee $2,600 a month tax-free to every adult citizen and legal resident, and $650 to each child. \n \n The payment would be provided to everyone, regardless of work status, income level, or wealth. It is a benefit few countries can afford. But then, Switzerland is among the world's richest nations, with a per capita income of about $85,000, 40% higher than that in the USA. \n \n The idea of an unconditional basic income is not new. It is being discussed by various cities in the Netherlands, Finland, Canada, New Zealand and other nations. But Switzerland is the first country to actually vote on a guaranteed income at the national level. \n \n The latest polls show the proposal likely will go down in defeat, though supporters say they hope to build support for it in the coming weeks. \n \n The initiative was put on the ballot by a group of artists, writers and intellectuals who made use of Switzerland's unique system of direct democracy, which allows any citizen to bring an issue to a referendum by collecting 100,000 legitimate signatures on a petition. \n \n \"This is a great idea,\" said Chloe Hubert, a student at the University of Geneva. \"I only work on weekends, so this income would really help.\" \n \n Though Swiss salaries are among the highest in the world, supporters say the stipend would offer people an option of reducing their working hours, while maintaining a decent standard of living. \n \n \u201cIt would lead to a more motivated workforce and more humanized, stable and productive economy,\u201d said Che Wagner, the initiative\u2019s co-organizer and campaign manager. \n \n Under the proposed law, the government would guarantee that every Swiss adult has at least $2,600 in monthly income after taxes. So if a person has no income at all, he or she will receive the full amount. If the person earns $1,600 now, the supplement would be $1,000. \n \n Marilola Wili, 21, is part of the campaign team. (Photo: Basic Income Switzerland) \n \n Someone who currently earns, say, $6,500 month would not receive any money from the government but $2,600 of it would not be taxed. \n \n For those getting welfare or other social benefits, payments of up to $2,600 a month would be replaced by the new basic income. Anything over this amount would continue to be provided as a separate payment and taxed accordingly. \n \n Theoretically, a family of two non-working adults and two children at home would be eligible for $6,500 a month, or $78,000 a year tax-free. That's nearly twice the after-tax income of a typical American family. \n \n The proposal has many critics. In a recent interview with Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, parliamentarian Raymond Clottu argued that the giveaway would \"put at risk a system that motivates people to work and get training. So we should try to improve it, not bring in basic income which would destroy the motivation to work.\" \n \n He and other opponents also note that financing the scheme, estimated to cost about $200 billion a year, would strain the government\u2019s coffers. \n \n The initiative\u2019s backers say the plan would be funded, among other sources of revenue, by increasing Switzerland\u2019s 8% value added tax. \n \n The government counters that other taxes would have to rise and spending slashed to afford such a generous giveaway. \n \n \u201cConsiderable cutbacks or tax rises would be necessary to finance this basic income, which could not replace today\u2019s social security system entirely,\u201d the government warns on its website, urging voters to reject the initiative. \n \n As the concept of basic income gets traction across Europe, could a similar policy be adopted in the U.S.? \n \n \u201cBefore it could be taken seriously, the middle class would need to experience far more job and wage loss than it has already,\u201d Robert Reich, former U.S. secretary of Labor and now professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, told USA TODAY. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, those losses are inevitable,\u201d he added. \u201cWe'll have a serious discussion about a minimum basic income about a decade from now.\u201d \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/26X2OQX ||||| Photo: Flickr \n \n The idea of granting every citizen a no-strings-attached universal basic income is still treated as a utopian idea in America. In Switzerland, they\u2019re a month away from voting on it. \n \n The measure is not likely to pass! Still, it\u2019s a notable step for the basic income movement. This appears to be the first time an entire nation will put the idea to a vote. The Swiss proposal would give \u201c$2,600 a month tax-free to every adult citizen and legal resident, and $650 to each child.\u201d The current proposal is also means-tested, meaning that those who earned more than $2,600 a month would not get the government stipend, although that part of their earnings would be tax-exempt. This makes it a not-quite universal basic income, but at least something within spitting distance of one. \n \n If you give children nothing it would be more affordable. Think about it. They can\u2019t vote. \n \n This vote will probably fail, and it is thoroughly possible that the measure is not perfectly conceived anyhow. But with global economic leaders discussing \u201chelicopter money\u201d schemes and prominent people of all political persuasions arguing for basic income to counteract technology\u2019s disruption of human jobs, a national vote feels like one more step on the road to legitimacy. \n \n I hope that this free money becomes real in my lifetime and NOT after.",

What Gawker says is perceived as the \"utopian idea\" of an unconditional basic income has been bandied about by individual cities in countries such as the Netherlands and Canada, but Switzerland would be the first nation to go for it.

The estimated $200 billion-a-year plan would be funded in part by raising the country's value-added tax (currently at 8%), its supporters say. Critics, however, say other taxes would have to rise, too, and fear the plan would sap people's motivation to work. Someone with no income would reap the full $2,600 a month tax-free, while others making some money would have their income supplemented to reach that cap (so if you already make $1,000, the government would fork over $1,600). And if you already bring in more than that $2,600 limit? That amount of your monthly income wouldn't be taxed.

The study, recently published in the journal Pure and Applied Geophysics, was centered at Hog Lake, a spot near Anza. \n \n The San Jacinto is part of the larger San Andreas fault, the dividing line between the Pacific and North American plates. Scientists say that the two faults are responsible for roughly 80 percent of the slippage along the plates. Rockwell has played a major role in revealing the path of the San Jacinto and reconstructing its history. Records show that the fault produced a magnitude 6.5 quake in April 1968.

But any solution is pretty far off, in terms of time and money\u2014in terms of the latter, the LAT uses the word \"billions.\" None of the aqueducts has yet had to deal with the scenario; the last huge quake (magnitude 7.9) along the fault was in 1857. The Los Angeles aqueduct travels across the fault under a mountain, by way of the five-mile-long concrete Elizabeth Tunnel. Building a brand new tunnel is the priciest option; sending water over the mountains via an electric pumping mechanism is another idea. In the case of the Colorado River Aqueduct, a quake could raise a section of the pipe by 13 feet, and there aren't any pumps in place to ferry the water to LA. The mayor last week requested that proposals on the issue be submitted by July. Meanwhile, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports that there may be another fault to fear: It points to new research that shows the San Jacinto fault could generate an earthquake as powerful as what the San Andreas fault is capable of.",

Iran's parliament has approved a bill to reduce Tehran's diplomatic relations with London and... (Associated Press) \n \n The mob surged past riot police into the British Embassy compound _ which they pelted with petrol bombs and stones _ two days after Iran's parliament approved a bill that reduces diplomatic relations with Britain following London's support of recently upgraded Western sanctions on Tehran over its disputed nuclear program. \n \n Less than two hours later, police appeared to regain control of the site. But the official IRNA news agency said about 300 protesters entered the British ambassador's residence in another part of the city and replaced British flags with Iranian ones. The British Foreign Office harshly denounced the melee and said Iran has a \"clear duty\" under international law to protect diplomats and offices. \n \n \"We are outraged by this,\" said the statement. \"It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it.\" \n \n It said a \"significant number\" of protesters entered the compound and caused vandalism, but gave no other details on damage or whether diplomatic staff was inside the embassy, although the storming occurred after business hours. \n \n The semiofficial Mehr news agency said embassy staff had left the compound before the mobs entered, but it also said those who occupied the area had taken six staff as hostages. It did not give their nationalities and the report could not immediately be confirmed. \n \n The protesters broke through after clashing with anti-riot police and chanting for its takeover. \"Death to England,\" some cried in the first significant assault of a foreign diplomatic area in Iran in years. More protesters poured into the compound as police tried to clear the site. \n \n Smoke rose from some areas of the embassy grounds and the British flag was replaced with a banner in the name of 7th century Shiite saint, Imam Hussein. Occupiers also tore down picture of Queen Elizabeth II. \n \n The occupier called for the closure of the embassy calling it a \"spy den\" _ the same phrase used after militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 hostages for 444 days. In the early moments of the siege, protesters tossed out papers from the compound and hauled down the U.S. flag. Washington and Tehran have no diplomatic relations since then. \n \n The rally outside the British Embassy _ on a main street in Tehran downtown _ included protesters carrying photographs of nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari, who was killed last year in an attack that Iran blamed on Israeli and British spy services. \n \n Outside the embassy, students from some universities and seminaries burned British flags on fire as clashing with police. \n \n State TV reported that another group of hard-line students gathered at the gate of British ambassador's residence in northern Tehran, at the same time. \n \n Britain's Foreign Office said it was in contact with embassy officials. Officials were still checking on the well-being of workers and diplomats, a spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity in line with standing policy. \n \n Tensions with Britain date back to the 19th century when the Persian monarchy gave huge industrial concessions to London, which later included significant control over Iran's oil industry. \n \n But they have become increasingly strained as the West accuses Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons _ a charge Tehran denies. \n \n In recent years, Iran was angered by Britain's decision in 2007 honor author Salman Rushdie with a knighthood. \n \n Rushdie went into hiding after Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a 1989 fatwa, or religious edict, ordering Muslims to kill the author because his novel \"The Satanic Verses\" allegedly insulted Islam. \n \n The decision shortly after Iran detained 15 British sailors and marines in March 2007 for allegedly entering the country's territorial waters in the Gulf _ a claim Britain denies. The 15 were released after nearly two weeks in captivity. \n \n In 2006, angry mobs burned the Danish flag and attacked Danish and other Western embassies in Tehran in protest to the reprinting of a cartoon deemed insulting of the Prophet Muhammad in the Nordic country's newspapers. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer David Stringer in London contributed to this report. ||||| TEHRAN Iranian protesters stormed two British diplomatic compounds in Tehran on Tuesday, smashing windows, torching a car and burning the British flag in protest against new sanctions imposed by London. \n \n Britain said it was outraged and warned of \"serious consequences.\" The U.N. Security Council condemned the attacks \"in the strongest terms.\" U.S. President Barack Obama said he was disturbed by the incident and called on Iran to hold those responsible to account. \n \n The attacks come at a time of rising diplomatic tension between Iran and Western nations who last week imposed fresh sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program, which they believe is aimed at achieving the capability of making an atomic bomb. \n \n Iran, the world's fifth biggest oil exporter, says it only wants nuclear plants to generate electricity. \n \n The embassy storming is also a sign of deepening political infighting within Iran's ruling hardline elites, with the conservative-led parliament attempting to force the hand of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and expel the British ambassador. \n \n \"Radicals in Iran and in the West are always in favor of crisis ... Such radical hardliners in Iran will use the crisis to unite people and also to blame the crisis for the fading economy,\" said political analyst Hasan Sedghi. \n \n Several dozen protesters broke away from a crowd of a few hundred outside the main British embassy compound in downtown Tehran, scaled the gates, broke the locks and went inside. \n \n Protesters pulled down the British flag, burned it, and put up the Iranian flag, Iranian news agencies and news pictures showed. Inside, the demonstrators smashed windows of office and residential quarters and set a car ablaze, news pictures showed. \n \n One took a framed picture of Queen Elizabeth, state TV showed. Others carried the royal crest out through the embassy gate as police stood by, pictures carried by the semi-official Fars news agency showed. \n \n All embassy personnel were accounted for, a British diplomat told Reuters in Washington, saying Britain did not believe that any sensitive materials had been seized. \n \n Demonstrators waved flags symbolizing martyrdom and held aloft portraits of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has the final say on matters of state in Iran. \n \n Another group of protesters broke into a second British compound at Qolhak in north Tehran, the IRNA state news agency said. Once the embassy's summer quarters, the sprawling, tree-lined compound is now used to house diplomatic staff. \n \n An Iranian report said six British embassy staff had been briefly held by the protesters. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the situation had been \"confusing\" and that he would not have called them \"hostages.\" \n \n \"Police freed the six people working for the British embassy in Qolhak garden,\" Iran's Fars news agency said. \n \n A German school next to the Qolhak compound was also damaged, the German government said. \n \n BRITAIN OUTRAGED \n \n Police appeared to have cleared the demonstrators in front of the main downtown embassy compound, but later clashed with protesters and fired tear gas to try to disperse them, Fars said. Protesters nevertheless entered the compound a second time, before once again leaving, it said. \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting of the government crisis committee to discuss the attacks which he said were \"outrageous and indefensible.\" \n \n \"The failure of the Iranian government to defend British staff and property was a disgrace,\" he said in a statement. \n \n \"The Iranian government must recognize that there will be serious consequences for failing to protect our staff. We will consider what these measures should be in the coming days.\" \n \n The United States, alongside the European Union and many of its member states also strongly condemned the attacks. \n \n There have been regular protests outside the British embassy over the years since the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah, but never have any been so violent. \n \n The attacks and hostage-taking were a reminder of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran carried out by radical students who held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Iran after the hostage-taking. \n \n All British embassy personnel were accounted for and safe, a British diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters in Washington. \n \n The diplomat said the attack likely flowed from Britain's November 21 decision to impose new sanctions on Iran because of its nuclear program, including a ban on British financial institutions dealing with their Iranian counterparts. \n \n \"It's impossible, really, not to reach that conclusion,\" the diplomat said, suggesting that the protests may have been sparked by the Iranian authorities. \n \n \"In the past we have certainly had demonstrations that have ... been sanctioned, if not encouraged, by the government. I don't know about this one. I don't think we'd put it past them,\" said the diplomat. \n \n \"It's hard to imagine, in a place like Iran, that these were some kind of spontaneous (event),\" said a State Department official who declined to be identified. \n \n INFIGHTING \n \n The demonstrations appeared to be a bid by conservatives who control parliament to press home their demand, passed in parliament last week and quickly endorsed by the Guardian Council on Tuesday, for the government to expel the British ambassador in retaliation for the sanctions. \n \n A lawmaker had warned on Sunday that angry Iranians could storm the British embassy. \n \n \"Parliament officially notified the president over a bill regarding degrading the ties with Britain, obliging the government to implement it within five days,\" Fars news agency quoted speaker Ali Larijani as saying. \n \n Ahmadinejad's government has shown no willingness to compromise on its refusal to halt its nuclear work, but has sought to keep channels of negotiation open in an effort to limit the worst effects of sanctions. \n \n An Iranian official told Reuters the storming of the British compounds was not planned by the government. \n \n \"It was not an organized measure. The establishment had no role in it. It was not planned,\" said the official, who declined to be identified. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it regretted the attacks and was committed to ensuring the safety of diplomats. \n \n Police arrested 12 people who had entered the north Tehran compound, Fars said, quoting a police chief as saying they would be handed over to the judiciary. \n \n Protesters said they planned to stage a sit-in at the gates of the north Tehran compound and would not move until they were told to do so by Iran's religious leaders. \n \n Britain, along with the United States and Canada, imposed new unilateral sanctions on Iran last week, while the EU, France and Italy have all said financial measures against Tehran should be strengthened. \n \n (Additional reporting by Hossein Jaseb and Hashem Kalantari in Tehran, Parisa Hafezi in Istanbul, William Maclean and Adrian Croft in London and Arshad Mohammed in Washington.

    "document": "\"This is the first serious biography of the exuberant man who transformed the Sears, Roebuck company into the country\u2019s most important retailer. He was also one of the early 20th century\u2019s notable philanthropists.... The richness of primary evidence continually delights.\" \u2014Judith Sealander, author of Private Wealth and Public Life \n \n \"[No] mere philanthropist [but a] subtle, stinging critic of our racial democracy.\" \u2014W. E. B. DuBois on Julius Rosenwald \n \n In this richly revealing biography of a major, but little-known, American businessman and philanthropist, Peter Ascoli brings to life a portrait of Julius Rosenwald, the man and his work. The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men\u2019s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald\u2019s meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy. He tells about Rosenwald\u2019s important philanthropic activities, especially those connected with the Rosenwald schools and Booker T. Washington, and later through the Rosenwald Fund. \n \n Ascoli\u2019s account of Rosenwald is an inspiring story of hard work and success, and of giving back to the nation in which he prospered. ||||| PHILADELPHIA (JTA) \u2014 Alex Bethea, the son of cotton and tobacco farm workers, was in sixth grade in 1965 when his family moved from Dillon, South Carolina, to the tiny town of Fairmont, North Carolina, where he attended a school called Rosenwald. \n \n But it wasn\u2019t until this week, 50 years later, that Bethea learned that his school was named for Julius Rosenwald, the Jewish philanthropist who is the subject of a new documentary by Aviva Kempner. The film tells the little-known story of Rosenwald\u2019s contribution to African-American culture and education. \n \n The revelation came at a July 14 session at the national convention of the NAACP, which drew several thousand delegates to Philadelphia. Bethea was one of some 70 people who attended a screening of the film, \u201cRosenwald.\u201d \n \n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up \n \n \u201cJulius Rosenwald had a great impact on my life, and I didn\u2019t even know it,\u201d said Bethea, now a vice principal at an elementary school in New Jersey. \u201cThis helps me put the pieces of the puzzle of my life together.\u201d \n \n The philanthropy Rosenwald invested in African-American causes in the early 1900s changed the course of education for thousands of children in the rural South and helped foster the careers of prominent artists, including writer Langston Hughes, opera singer Marion Anderson and painter Jacob Lawrence. \n \n Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., also provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country. In addition, he developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to help improve the living conditions for the masses who had migrated from the Jim Crow South. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\u201d Julian Bond, the renowned civil rights leader, says in the documentary. \n \n Kempner told JTA that her new film on Rosenwald \u201ccelebrates the affinity between African-Americans and Jews\u201d that started long before the civil rights movement and speaks to the powerful Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. \n \n Kempner joined Bond and Rabbi David Saperstein, the former head of the Reform movement\u2019s Religious Action Center who now serves as U.S. ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom, for a discussion after the screening at the NAACP conference. It was while attending a public program 12 years ago on Martha\u2019s Vineyard at which Bond and Saperstein discussed black-Jewish relations that Kempner first learned of Rosenwald\u2019s work with African-Americans. \n \n She calls this film the last of a trilogy documenting the lives of \u201cunder-known Jewish heroes.\u201d The first two were about baseball legend Hank Greenberg and radio and TV personality Gertrude Berg. \n \n Interspersing archival footage with interviews with prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), both of whom attended Rosenwald schools, the documentary tracks the ascent of Rosenwald, the son of German immigrants who rose to become one of the most powerful businessmen and philanthropists in early 20th-century America. \n \n His father, Sam, who came to America in 1851, began, like so many Jewish immigrants of his time, as a peddler. He eventually settled in Springfield, Illinois, where Julius grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s home. \n \n In 1878, his parents sent the 16-year-old Julius to New York to apprentice with his uncles in the men\u2019s clothing manufacturing business. He returned to Illinois to start his own manufacturing company, and through some business and family connections ultimately partnered with Richard Sears, one of the founders of Sears, Roebuck and Co. After Rosenwald took over the company in 1908, it became the largest retailer in the country. \n \n Outside his business life, Rosenwald was heavily influenced by his rabbi, Emil Hirsch, the spiritual leader of the Chicago Sinai Congregation, and he became a major benefactor of Jewish causes. \n \n The film\u2019s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America \n \n The film\u2019s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America. He was particularly moved by the race riots in 1908 in Springfield, which are said to have sparked the founding of the NAACP. Hirsch was one of the original leaders of the NAACP, and Rosenwald sponsored its first meetings at his temple. \n \n He was also influenced by the writings of Booker T. Washington, a prominent black leader at the time, and became a funder of Washington\u2019s Tuskegee University in Alabama. \n \n When Rosenwald gave a $25,000 gift to Tuskegee, Washington suggested taking a few thousand dollars to build six schools for young children. Until then, most black children didn\u2019t attend school, but instead spent their time working in the fields alongside their parents. The few schools that did exist were primitive shacks staffed mostly by untrained teachers. \n \n Rather than donating all the money for the schools, Rosenwald gave one-third of the funds needed and challenged the local black community to raise another third and the local white community to contribute the rest. In the end, some 5,300 schools were built with seed money from the Rosenwald Fund. \n \n The Rosenwald Fund \u2018was the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century\u2019 \n \n The fund soon switched focus and began supporting promising black artists, helping catapult dozens onto the national stage. \n \n The Rosenwald Fund \u201cwas the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century,\u201d poet Rita Dove says in the film. \n \n Kempner calls Rosenwald one of the greatest examplars of American Jewish philanthropy and says she hopes her film \u2013 whose official opening in theaters is scheduled for mid-August \u2014 will motivate others to continue that tradition. \n \n \u201cNot all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\u201d she said, noting that he gave away a total of $62 million in his lifetime, but \u201cwe can all do something.\u201d ||||| Screenshot from the Rosenwald documentary Julius Rosenwald stands with black American students who attended one of over 5,000 schools he built for African-American students in the 20th century. \n \n In the trailer for the documentary Rosenwald, civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) describes the type of school he went to as a child. \n \n \"It was a little school a short distance from my home\u2014walking distance. Beautiful little building. It was a Rosenwald school. It was the only school we had,\" Lewis said. \n \n A Rosenwald school\u2014named after Julius Rosenwald, a 20th-century Jewish philanthropist who made his fortune by co-founding the department store we refer to today as Sears. \n \n The trailer, released exclusively by The Root, describes how Rosenwald was a relentless businessman but was also deeply inspired by the works and racial-equality teachings of Booker T. Washington. Or, more specifically, Washington's emphasis on what a solid education could do for the racially disadvantaged in America. So much so that Rosenwald teamed up with Washington, and together they hatched a plan to build over 5,000 schools for black students in the Jim Crow South. \n \n It was a pretty important endeavor, since segregation prohibited blacks from attending the all-white schools in many Southern states. \n \n The late poet Maya Angelou appears in the documentary, which is slated to be released in New York Aug. 14, and the rest of the nation throughout the fall. Angelou spoke about one of the schools she attended as a child, a school that was also built by Rosenwald. \n \n \"I thought my school was grand. It was the Lafayette County Training School,\" Angelou said. \n \n Civil rights and education-reform activist Julian Bonds is also a product of a Rosenwald school. He explained the significance of a Jewish man in the middle of the 20th century committing himself so vehemently to the idea that black American children must be educated. \n \n \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist, who did not have to care about black people but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" Bonds said.",

Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

    "document": "An affluent Connecticut couple disappeared a week after losing an appeal over more than $2.2 million they owe in debt, according to court records. \n \n Jeffrey Navin, 56, and Jeanette Navin, 55, were reported missing by relatives on Aug. 7, three days after they were last seen near their home in Easton, about 65 miles north of midtown Manhattan, police said. \n \n The couple's car was found in a park-n-ride off Exit 42 of the Merritt Parkway in Westport on Aug. 9, police said. \n \n The Navins could be on vacation because they travel often, Easton Police Chief Tim Shaw told reporters Tuesday. But they usually tell their relatives they're leaving, and authorities expected them to return home over the weekend. \n \n He said police did not suspect foul play in the disappearance of Jeffrey, who runs a sanitation company in Westport, and Jeanette, who works as a paraprofessional at Weston Intermediate School's library. \n \n A week before their disappearance, a judge denied the Navins' second motion to appeal in a foreclosure case worth millions with HSBC Bank USA, court records show. \n \n HSBC filed the suit in 2007 after the couple allegedly failed to pay a cent on their $1.3 million mortgage on another house in Guilford, the Hartford Courant reported. \n \n The debt on the 8,265-square-foot house -- which has six bedrooms and a 10-acre wooded property, according to real estate site Zillow -- nearly doubled by December 2014 to a whopping $2.2 million. \n \n The case is still pending but is not the only one against the Navins for debt. \n \n In November, a power company claimed Jeffrey owed $139,000 in unpaid electric fees for the same house, court records show. A judge ordered him to pay it back in weekly installments of $35. \n \n The couple sold a house in 2012 to resolve another foreclosure filed by OCWEN Financial Corp. in 1999, according to records. The sale was linked to a 2002 civil case involving Jeffrey and Essex Savings Bank, although the details of that case were not immediately available. \n \n But relatives denied Thursday morning that the couple's money problems caused them to go missing, noting their bank accounts are \"untouched\" during this \"overwhelming and troubling time.\" \n \n \"Financial issues recently reported by the media have not been proven to be a factor for our family members' disappearance,\" the family said in a statement. \n \n \"We are shocked and saddened at the unexpected disappearance of Jeff and Jeanette Navin. There are no words to describe the impact this has had on their parents, siblings and children. We wish only for their safe return.\" \n \n Shaw told the Daily News Thursday that he could not comment \"on anything as far as financial records go.\" \n \n \"We're investigating everything that we can,\" Shaw said. \n \n The couple earned up to $216,000 a year, according to Nexis Lexis records. The Navins also moved into a custom-built 4,000-square-foot house in Westport in 1994 and sold it for $900,000 in June, records show. They soon began renting a home in Easton, where the median household income is $142,000 -- double the state average. \n \n Jeffrey's company, J&J Refuse, began with \"one man in a truck in 1985 and has been growing ever since,\" according to its website. It does not appear to be one of the municipality's vendors, according to town financial records. \n \n Jeanette is a \"beloved employee\" for the Weston Public Schools district, where she has worked for 18 years, Superintendent Colleen Palmer said in an email to staff Tuesday. \n \n The Navins' longtime attorney, Kenneth Davis, said he hasn't seen them in about a month and that he doubts their debt would lead to physical harm against them. \n \n \"I'm in the dark just like everybody is,\" he told the Courant. \"I just hope they're all right.\" \n \n ON MOBILE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE. ||||| The investigation into the disappearance of an Easton couple has been turned over to the state police and detectives are searching a Bridgeport home belonging to their son. \n \n Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin were reported missing Aug. 7 to the Easton Police Department, and while it is still technically considered a missing persons case, the State Police Western District Major Crime Squad has taken over the investigation. \n \n Late Wednesday, state police and Bridgeport detectives searched a house on Aldine Avenue in Bridgeport where Kyle Navin, the couple's son, lives. \n \n Police have not said why they searched the home. Kyle Navin is listed as the general manager of the family's refuse company. \n \n Sources said evidence found in the couple's abandoned pickup truck that has since been sent to the state forensic laboratory for analysis led investigators to ramp up the investigation, with as many as a half-dozen detectives working on it. \n \n The state police are poring through a ton of paperwork trying to backtrack where the Navins may have been before they disappeared. \u2014 Easton Police Chief Timothy Shaw \n \n The couple's truck was found Aug. 9 in a commuter parking lot off exit 42 of the Merritt Parkway, on the border of Weston and Westport. Until recently, the Navins lived in Weston. Their family-owned garbage company, J&J Refuse, operates in Westport. \n \n Jeffrey Navin, 56, was last seen at work Aug. 4. Police have not said when anyone last had contact with Jeanette Navin, 55. \n \n \"The state police are poring through a ton of paperwork trying to backtrack where the Navins may have been before they disappeared,\" Easton Police Chief Timothy Shaw said. \n \n Sources said investigators are reviewing bank records, credit card purchases and cellphone records, as well as talking to the couple's friends and coworkers. It is unclear if their cellphones have been found. \n \n \"We are looking at everything, nothing is being ruled out,\" Shaw said this week. Investigators from Easton are assisting the state police. \n \n Police initially suspected the Navins, who liked to take spur-of-the-moment vacations, had gone away without telling anyone. But as time passed, police said they began to suspect the two either willingly disappeared or were victims of foul play. \n \n A review of public records shows the Navins had spent part of the past few months downsizing and paying off old debts. \n \n On May 28, Jeanette Navin sold the family's longtime home on Osborn Farm Road in Weston for $900,000, records show. The couple moved to a rental home in Easton, where they were living at the time of their disappearance. Police have searched the home for evidence. \n \n The Navins had owned the Weston property since 1994 when Jeanette Navin purchased it for $135,000. Over the years they had made several improvements to the home, including spending more than $25,000 to install an in-ground swimming pool, according to Weston town records. \n \n In June, three old mortgages and home equity loans that Jeanette Navin had taken out on the Osborn Farm Road home were released. More than $780,000 in mortgages held by People's Bank and JPMorgan Chase bank were released between June 9 and June 26, records show. \n \n Jeffrey Navin is not listed on any of the legal documents for the Weston home. \n \n Jeffrey Navin was involved in a legal battle over a $1.4 million home that he owns in Guilford that was originally built by Colleen McCullough, the author of the best-selling book \"The Thorn Birds,\" as a retreat. Court records show that Navin has been involved in a long-running foreclosure battle over a Guilford house at 7 Hart Landing Road. \n \n HSBC Bank USA filed a foreclosure against Navin in 2007, alleging that he had failed to pay any of a $1.3 million mortgage on 7 Hart Landing Road. Navin has appealed the judgment against him twice but lost both times. \n \n The case is still pending in New Haven court eight years after it was filed. A judge denied Navin's latest attempt to reopen the case in late July, court records show. The debt that Navin owes has grown to $2.2 million as of the end of 2014, according to court records. \n \n Connecticut Light & Power, now called Eversource, also took Navin to court last year, claiming he owed about $130,600 for electrical service for the Hart Landing Road house. In November, Navin was ordered to pay $138,137.79 in $35 weekly payments, plus interest. Navin, who disputed the amount owed, appealed. \n \n The Guilford house was listed for sale at a price of $1.4 million by the Settlers & Traders Real Estate Co. in Westport. But the listing agent, Michael Calise, said Wednesday that the house is no longer on the market. He said a third party recently told him to take it off the market. He declined to comment further. \n \n Jeffrey Navin has operated J&J Refuse Inc. in Westport since the mid-1980s. The company's website was taken off-line in the days after it became public that the couple was missing, but has recently gone back online, and the couple's son, Kyle Navin, is listed as the operations manager. \n \n Jeanette Navin has worked in the Weston school district since 1996. She is a paraprofessional assigned to the Weston Intermediate School library. School officials said that since word of her disappearance became public, concerned parents have been calling. \n \n \"Jeanette is a beloved member of our school community,\" Weston Superintendent Colleen Palmer said in a statement. \n \n \"Our entire district is extremely concerned that she and her husband have not yet been located, and we continue to offer our support in any way that would further the efforts of law enforcement to find them and bring them home safely.\" ||||| Story highlights Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin of Easton, Connecticut, were last seen on August 4 \n \n Days earlier, they'd lost in court over $2.2 million in debt tied to their second home \n \n Their family says the financial woes may have nothing to do with the disappearance \n \n (CNN) A Connecticut couple has disappeared days after losing their latest appeal in a multimillion-dollar foreclosure case, a disappearance that a local police chief said appears increasingly suspicious though the pair's family said it may be unrelated to their financial woes. \n \n Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin of Easton, Connecticut, were last seen on Tuesday, August 4, at the refuse company they own in Westport, according to Easton Police Chief Tim Shaw. \n \n In late July, Jeffrey Navin was denied his latest appeal in an ongoing eight-year battle over a mortgage on the family's second home in central Connecticut, according to court documents. \n \n Navin took out a mortgage on the home -- a six-bedroom, five-bath, 8,265-square foot residence on a 10\u00bd-acre lot, according to Zillow.com -- in 2005 for $1.3 million and stopped paying in 2007, the records show.

Police found the pickup belonging to Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin in a commuter parking lot by the exit of a local expressway on Aug. 9 but say there's no sign of foul play. The Easton police chief says it's possible the Navins are on vacation somewhere safe and sound, but acknowledges that suspicion is mounting the longer they remain out of touch. Money problems had been piling up for the Navins, last seen Aug. 4 at a garbage company they own. Jeffrey took out a $1.3 million mortgage on a six-bedroom-five-bathroom house in 2005 and stopped paying it in 2007. He lost his third appeal over the $2.2 million he owes in the foreclosure case in July. He also racked up six-figure debt to the power company. The Hartford Courant reports the couple sold another of their homes for $900,000 in June and moved to a rental house. Family members object to the focus on finances and point out that the couple, who earned up to $216,000 a year, haven't touched their bank accounts in this \"overwhelming and troubling time,\" the Daily News reports.

He claims that he witnessed \"a naked Casey\" when he arrived at Baez's office unexpectedly.In the documents, he also alleges that Baez \"told me that Casey had murdered Caylee and dumped the body somewhere and, he needed all the help he could get to find the body before anyone else did.\"In a statement to PEOPLE, Baez disputes all Dominic Casey's allegations. \"I unequivocally and categorically deny exchanging sex for my legal services with Ms. Anthony,\" he writes. \"I further unequivocally and categorically deny having any sexual relationship with Ms. Anthony whatsoever.\"\"I have always conducted my practice consistent with the high ethical standards required of members of the Florida Bar,\" he continues. \"My representation of Ms. Anthony was no exception.\"\"Legal action is forthcoming,\" Baez writes.This isn't the first time that Dominic Casey's claims have raised eyebrows.In a 2011 deposition obtained by PEOPLE, the investigator floats several theories about the Caylee's disappearance and death, and even says that he wasn't entirely sure that the remains found near Anthony's house were the 2-year-old.In his statement, Baez references Dominic Casey's former claims. \"This libelous claim is in line with many other outrageous claims and theories that this individual has advanced regarding the Casey Anthony case,\" the statement says.Dominic Casey did not return PEOPLE's messages for comment. ||||| Five years after Casey Anthony was acquitted of murdering her daughter, a civil lawsuit connected to the scandal is still grinding through Central Florida bankruptcy court, with new developments this week. \n \n The man who found Caylee Marie Anthony's body in 2008 \u2013 Roy Kronk \u2013 filed a suit against Anthony in 2011, alleging that she, through her attorneys, falsely accused Kronk of killing the girl. \n \n The new filings in the case feature allegations made by private investigator Dominic Casey about Anthony and Anthony's lawyer, Jose Baez. \n \n Dominic Casey this week alleged that Anthony and her attorneys talked openly of her guilt, and that Baez had sex with her, according to Dominic Casey's affidavit written by the investigator and accepted by the court. \n \n An attorney in Baez' office, responding to questions raised by the Sentinel, said in an email that Baez questioned Dominic Casey's motivations in making the accusations. \n \n \"I unequivocally and categorically deny exchanging sex for my legal services with Ms. Anthony,\" said a statement from Baez's firm. \n \n Dominic Casey has written two books with unsubstantiated claims about the case. Lawyers for Casey Anthony don't want him to provide testimony in the Kronk case, according to documents filed in the case. \n \n Dominic Casey has been deposed by Kronk's attorneys and a transcript of that was filed on the court docket. Casey Anthony's lawyers have filed motions to strike Dominic Casey's deposition. They are also demanding to see records he claims to have. \n \n Kronk's case was delayed when Anthony filed for bankruptcy in 2013, but eventually it was moved over to the bankruptcy court, where Kronk is now arguing that her bankruptcy should not prevent him from recovering damages related to his claim of defamation. \n \n Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez talks about Lifetime's \"Prosecuting Casey Anthony\" movie.

    "document": "Kisspeptin The molecule of puberty \n \n and sexual fertility Paul May \n \n University of Bristol Molecule of the Month September 2010 \n \n Also available: JSMol version. \n \n Surely nothing to do with Gene Simmons and Co.? \n \n No, not the rock band Kiss, although it has similarities it that it also sends teenagers wild. Kisspeptin is a protein that when released from the brain triggers the cascade of biochemical changes that leads to puberty, turning children into adults. Puberty is still one of the great unsolved mysteries in biology. Scientists have known for years that puberty begins when a child's brain releases hormones that cascade through the body leading to the maturing of testes in boys and ovaries in girls. However, the exact nature of the hormones wasn't fully understood until a few years ago, when kisspeptin was discovered. Adolescents who lack a functioning kisspeptin system fail to achieve puberty. We now know that, almost literally, \u2018puberty begins with a kiss\u2019! \n \n It started with a kiss... \n \n Kisspeptins are actually a group of proteins with similar structure, and are products of the KiSS-1 gene. This gene was discovered in 1996 [Lee et al., 2006] when scientists were searching for a gene that prevents cancer from spreading. This groundbreaking work took place in research labs in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, the location also famous for the Hershey's chocolate factory. Since Hershey's most popular product is a chocolate confectionary called a Hershey's Kiss (photo, right), the discoverers' of the gene named it KiSS-1 after this chocolate. However, the nomenclature also has a scientific grounding as the inclusion of SS in the name also indicates that the gene is a suppressor sequence, i.e. it prevents some biological process from occurring (such as cancer spreading). Kisspeptin was first given the name metastin, because it was thought to play a role in tumor metastasis, but later named kisspeptin after its gene pecursor. The receptor for kisspeptin in the brain was identified only recently and was given the rather less whimsical name GPR54 (G-Protein Coupled Receptor 54). \n \n The KiSS-1 gene is found on the long-arm of chromosome 1. The protein it makes is a peptide containing 145 amino-acids, which are then cleaved into smaller, 54-amino-acid chunks. These may also be further truncated down to 14, 13 or even 10 amino-acids fragments with carboxylic acid terminations. These N-terminally truncated peptides are known as the family of kisspeptins. Kisspeptin-10 is shown below. \n \n ...never thought it would come to this \n \n A single injection of kisspeptin in animals has been found to stimulate a huge increase in the secretion of gonadotropins (hormones that stimulate the production of testosterone in men and estradiol in women). Repeated injections into immature rats has been shown to advance the age of puberty. \n \n Very recently, a group of Japanese scientists delivered an antibody directed against kisspeptin into the brain of female rats. This stopped the rats' reproductive cycle demonstrating that inhibiting the effect of kisspeptin, even after puberty, still blocks reproductive function. Therefore, as well as being vital to initiate puberty, kisspeptin is necessary for reproductive function to continue later in life. Later, Spanish scientists discovered that administering kisspeptin in food-restricted rats still stimulated the release of gonadotropins. This is a remarkable discovery, since normally when a mammal is facing starvation its reproductive system becomes dormant to conserve the body's stored food supply. Kisspeptin injections over-ride this defence mechanism, and can kick-start normally dormant reproductive systems. \n \n It has also been discovered that kisspeptin plays a role in seasonal-breeding animals. Many mammals only become fertile during the annual breeding season, and this is controlled by the duration of daylight per day. During short winter days, these anmials have a reduced amount of kisspeptin in certain parts of the brain, and sexual activity is switched off (or greatly reduced). But in the long summer days, kisspeptin amounts increase, stimulating the animals to breed. Artificially injecting animals (such as ewes) with kisspeptin during the winter months causes ovulation even in the non-breeding season [Dhilo 2008]. This has implications for farmers, who may soon be able to choose when their livestock reproduce rather than be restricted by the natural annual cycle. \n \n The kiss of life? \n \n Because of its link with the KiSS-1 gene, kisspeptin has been suggested as a possible treatment for some forms of cancer. In particular, when breast and prostate cancers develop, they are nurtured by the sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone. If the production of these hormones could be switched off the tumours should shrivel and die. One way to do this might be to block the kisspeptin-receptor in the brain. Scientists are now actively looking for molecules that can block this receptor. \n \n Kisspeptin's role in switching-on sexual hormones could be vital in controlling the timing of puberty when this goes wrong. There are a number of conditions where children that reach puberty much too early (five or six years old) could possibly be treated by simply taking pills containing kispeptin derivatives. Conversely, for young people in which puberty does not begin as normal in their teenage years, it may be possible to administer kisspeptin to kick-start the process. \n \n It has recently been found that kisspeptin can restart the female reproductive system in women who have stopped ovulating due to an imbalance in their sex hormones. Kisspeptin is therefore a potential basis for a new infertility treatment. \n \n References \n \n W.S. Dhillo, J. Neuroendocrin . 20 (2008) 963 - a good review paper. \n \n .

The work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council. \n \n Kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the release of other reproductive hormones inside the body. The study involved a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 29 healthy heterosexual young men were given either an injection of kisspeptin or placebo. In an MRI scanner the men were shown a variety of images, including sexual and non-sexual romantic pictures of couples, whilst researchers scanned their brains to see how kisspeptin affected the brain's responses. \n \n Ultimately, we are keen to look into whether kisspeptin could be an effective treatment for psychosexual disorders, and potentially help countless couples who struggle to conceive. \u2013 Professor Waljit Dhillo Department of Medicine \n \n The researchers found that after the injection of kisspeptin, when the volunteers were shown sexual or romantic images of couples, there was enhanced activity in structures in the brain typically activated by sexual arousal and romance. \n \n The team believe this shows kisspeptin boosts behavioural circuits associated with sex and love. They are particularly interested in how kisspeptin might be able to help people with psychosexual disorders and related problems with conceiving a baby. \n \n NIHR Research Professor Waljit Dhillo, the lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: \"Most of the research and treatment methods for infertility to date have focussed on the biological factors that may make it difficult for a couple to conceive naturally. These of course play a huge part in reproduction, but the role that the brain and emotional processing play in this process is also very important, and only partially understood.\" \n \n As the research is at an early stage, the team of researchers now want to do a follow on study to analyse the effects of kisspeptin in a larger group, including women as well as men. \n \n Professor Dhillo added: \"Our initial findings are novel and exciting as they indicate that kisspeptin plays a role in stimulating some of the emotions and responses that lead to sex and reproduction. Ultimately, we are keen to look into whether kisspeptin could be an effective treatment for psychosexual disorders, and potentially help countless couples who struggle to conceive.\" \n \n Volunteers in the study underwent MRI scans at the Imanova Centre for Imaging Sciences and were shown sexual and non-sexual romantic, negative, and neutral-themed images, and images of happy, fearful and neutral emotional faces. Kisspeptin did not appear to alter emotional brain activity in response to neutral, happy or fearful-themed images. However, when volunteers were shown negative images, kisspeptin did enhance activity in brain structures important in regulating negative moods, and study participants reported a reduction in negative mood in a post-scan questionnaires. As a result, the team are also interested in investigating the possibility that kisspeptin might be used for treating depression. \n \n Left image: Orange highlights illustrate the enhanced activity in the brain when the subjects had the kisspeptin injection and looked at sexual images. These areas of the brain have often been associated with processing of sexual, emotional and rewarding stimuli. \n \n Right image: Orange highlights show areas of the brain that were more responsive to couple-bonding images when the subjects had the kisspeptin injection.These areas of the brain have often been associated with memory and processing of romantic, emotional and rewarding stimuli. \n \n Dr Alexander Comninos, first author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said \"'Our study shows that kisspeptin boosts sexual and romantic brain activity as well as decreasing negative mood. This raises the interesting possibility that kisspeptin may have uses in treating psychosexual disorders and depression which are major health problems which often occur together, but further studies would be needed to investigate this.\" \n \n \"Kisspeptin Modulates Sexual and Emotional Brain Processing in Humans\" by Waljit S Dhillo et al is published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. \n \n See the press release of this article ||||| In this study, we demonstrate that the reproductive hormone kisspeptin enhances limbic brain activity specifically in response to sexual and bonding stimuli and that these responses correlate with psychometric measures of sexual and emotional processing. Sexual and emotional responses are fundamental drivers of human behavior, and the links among sex, bonding, and reproduction ultimately ensure the survival of most mammalian species (20). However, the pathways involved are multiple, complex, relatively poorly understood, and involve reproductive and metabolic hormones, pheromones, neuronal networks, peripheral organs, and various sensory signals, among others. Our data suggest a potential role for kisspeptin as an important neuromodulator, linking sexual and emotional brain processing with the reproductive axis. \n \n Visually evoked sexual arousal is a frequent occurrence in men, and brain activity associated with visual sexual stimuli have been explored in several previous studies. These studies have examined a wide range of brain structures in response to sexual-themed images and revealed a processing network involving structures including the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, cingulate, insula, precentral gyrus, and occipital cortex (13\u201315, 21\u201328). Furthermore, activations in structures including the thalamus and cingulate correlate with physiological sexual arousal (as assessed by penile tumescence) (13). The involvement of these structures therefore suggests cognitive (cingulate, thalamus), emotional (amygdala, insula), motivational (precentral gyrus), and physiological (thalamus) components to sexual arousal from the appraisal of a stimulus as sexual through to the autonomic activation in readiness for sexual behavior (13, 27, 28). \n \n Kisspeptin sits at the apex of the reproductive axis, above gonadal hormones such as testosterone that are known to be involved in sexual and emotional processing (29). Kisspeptin signaling is also essential in the \u201ctiming\u201d of reproduction, from regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility, oestrous cyclicity, and sexual development to aging (30). In our study, kisspeptin enhanced activity in key limbic and paralimbic structures when heterosexual young men viewed sexual images. These included the anterior and posterior cingulate as well as the left amygdala, consistent with areas of activation observed in the above studies (13\u201315, 21\u201328) and with regions expressing kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptors (4\u201310). Therefore, we demonstrate that kisspeptin administration enhances activation in key established areas of the sexual-processing network. \n \n It is interesting that, although kisspeptin enhanced activity in both the right and left amygdala, this only reached statistical significance on the left. Although the right amygdala often shows greater enhancement during image-related emotion stimulation (31, 32), the left amygdala is more often engaged in sexual (14) and emotional processing in men (33), and so in this study, kisspeptin may be preferentially acting on the left amygdala in keeping with these studies. Future studies may seek to examine whether there is a lateralization of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression in the amygdala to address this further. \n \n We then proceeded to correlate modulations in brain activity with our psychometric data to provide functional relevance. Interestingly, kisspeptin\u2019s enhancement of several structures of the sexual-processing network (including the cingulate, putamen, and globus pallidus) correlated with reduced sexual aversion, suggesting a role for kisspeptin in sexual disinhibition. \n \n Drive and reward traits are primary components of BAS, which has key functions in bringing the individual together with biological rewards such as sex and food (34, 35). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that these traits predict fMRI responses to appetizing foods (36) and sexual images (37). The neural substrate of the BAS comprises structures belonging to the mesolimbic reward and fronto-striatal-amygdala-midbrain networks (36, 37). Intriguingly, in our study, kisspeptin activated key components related to these networks (including the hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate) more in participants with lower baseline drive and reward traits in response to viewing sexual images. It is interesting to speculate as to a functional reason for this. Kisspeptin was able to enhance activity in components of this reward circuitry more in participants who were less reward responsive. This could serve as a functional mechanism for enhancing reward-system activity during sexual arousal (in those generally less responsive to reward), so as to drive a desire for reproduction in these individuals. \n \n Collectively, these data suggest that kisspeptin not only enhances activation in established structures of sexual arousal, but that this activation correlates with behavioral measures of reward, drive, and sexual aversion. Consistent with the expression pattern of kisspeptin and its cognate receptor in these regions (4\u201310), we provide evidence for kisspeptin as a neuroendocrine modulator of the human brain sexual-processing network. \n \n In addition to sexual stimulation, an important precursor to reproduction is the desire to bond with a partner. Studies of bonding have examined different types: romantic love, maternal love, and unconditional love. Studies of romantic love demonstrate activations in dopamine-rich and basal ganglia structures such as the putamen, thalamus, and globus pallidus (17, 38, 39), which are associated with reward (40), pair-bonding (41), and euphoria (16). In addition, activations are commonly seen in areas associated with mental associations (e.g., hippocampus and thalamus) and emotional areas also implicated in sexual processing (e.g., cingulate and amygdala) (17, 38, 39, 42). There is substantial overlap with the processing networks in maternal love, including the cingulate, globus pallidus, amygdala, and dopaminergic brain areas (43). Activations are also observed in reward and dopamine-rich areas (e.g., globus pallidus and cingulate) in unconditional love (44). Taken together, these studies suggest a common subcortical dopaminergic reward-related brain system as well as higher-order cortical cognitive centers driving love and bonding. \n \n In the current study, kisspeptin modulated the response to bonding images in regions similar to those seen with sexual images, including the anterior and posterior cingulate and amygdala, with the addition of activation in the thalamus and globus pallidus. These activations by kisspeptin match regions implicated in romantic love, maternal love, and even unconditional love in the aforementioned studies as well as being sites of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression (4\u201310). Furthermore, we observed that kisspeptin\u2019s enhanced activation of the amygdala in response to bonding images correlated with improvements in positive mood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that kisspeptin enhanced activity in key \u201cromance and bonding\u201d structures in response to viewing couple-bonding images and that this correlated with improved positive mood. We therefore provide evidence in humans of a role for kisspeptin in the processing of sexual and bonding stimuli, both of which are critical in driving reproduction at a behavioral level. \n \n Consistent with the correlation between kisspeptin\u2019s enhancement of amygdala activity and improvements in positive mood in humans above, recent rodent data suggest antidepressant-like effects for kisspeptin via the serotonergic system (45). In our study, kisspeptin enhanced prefrontal activity in response to negative images; a region expressing kisspeptin receptors (9). This is consistent with studies of negative-evoked stimuli, demonstrating predominant activation in prefrontal regions commonly implicated in response inhibition and self-control. Greater activity in these regions assists internalized representations of safety to minimize fear and anxiety to negative stimuli (19). In keeping with this, we observed that kisspeptin administration elicited a reduction in negative mood, providing human evidence of an antidepressant-like effect for kisspeptin, a finding with clear clinical implications. \n \n The hippocampus is heavily involved in producing emotions. In our study, sexual- and bonding-themed stimuli resulted in positive increases in activity in the hippocampus (i.e., increases in mean percentage of blood-oxygen-level\u2013dependent [BOLD] signal change) in line with previous studies (25, 46). In other words, the images were able to stimulate hippocampal activity. However, there was no significant difference in this increased activity between kisspeptin and vehicle administration. Overall, these data suggest that kisspeptin may have a greater effect on other limbic structures involved in emotional processing, such as the amygdala, cingulate, thalamus, and globus pallidus rather than the hippocampus. \n \n It is salient to note that the effects of kisspeptin on the limbic system were confined to sexual and couple-bonding images, with no limbic effects in response to negative-, neutral-, happy-, or fearful-themed images. In addition, kisspeptin had no effect on brain activity during a battery of nonlimbic tasks (visual, auditory, motor, language, calculation). These data highlight that kisspeptin acts specifically to enhance limbic activity only to sexual and couple-bonding stimulation in our study, which is particularly pertinent given its established role as a potent reproductive hormone (1\u20133). It is also noteworthy that kisspeptin administration had no effect in the current study on other relevant hormones that could affect limbic activity, including testosterone, oxytocin, and cortisol as well as attention and anxiety. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrate that kisspeptin administration has no effect on other endocrine hormones, including growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone in humans (47). \n \n It is important to consider the physiological implications of our findings using the experimental paradigm employed in this study. Physiologically, kisspeptin is predominantly synthesized and secreted from kisspeptin neurones in the infundibular nucleus of the hypothalamus in humans (48) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) in rodents (49). This kisspeptin then activates kisspeptin receptors on GnRH neurones, stimulating pulsatile GnRH release into the hypophyseal-portal circulation and downstream reproductive hormones. This secretion does appear to be pulsatile in rodents (49), and work in monkeys demonstrates pulsatile kisspeptin secretion (every 30 to 90 minutes) into the hypophyseal-pituitary circulation (50). In this study, kisspeptin was administered peripherally, as it is obviously not possible to administer it into the hypothalamus in humans, and we acknowledge that this differs from physiological kisspeptin release. However, the levels of kisspeptin achieved in this study are similar to those observed physiologically in normal pregnancy (51, 52). In addition, the kisspeptin levels observed in this study were similar to the kisspeptin levels achieved in previous studies in which peripheral kisspeptin administration stimulated oocyte maturation in in vitro fertilization protocols (53) and restored luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in women with hypothalamic amenorrhoea (54). Furthermore, our study and others have demonstrated that peripheral kisspeptin administration does not result in downregulation of the reproductive axis in the time frame used in this study in healthy men (54\u201357). As such, while our protocol does not precisely mimic normal physiology, in the current study, we administered doses of kisspeptin that have previously been shown to have physiological and sustained reproductive effects. \n \n Another important point to consider is whether peripherally administered kisspeptin can get into the brain. Peripheral kisspeptin can access GnRH neurones via their dendritic terminals in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) outside the blood-brain barrier (58, 59). To examine other brain areas, we administered radiolabeled kisspeptin peripherally to male mice and demonstrated that it can access the brain, including limbic structures (Supplemental Figure 6). Although this study was performed in mice, it suggests that peripheral kisspeptin can cross the blood-brain barrier and directly access brain regions expressing kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptors (4\u201310). Future work will no doubt examine the neuronal pathways involved, expanding on established interactions among kisspeptin (6), GABA (60), and nitric oxide (61) pathways. \n \n In conclusion, we implicate kisspeptin as a modulator of reproductive hormones, limbic brain activity, and behavior. This is supported by the findings of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression in limbic and paralimbic structures (4\u201310). We demonstrate that kisspeptin administration enhances limbic responses to sexual and bonding stimuli and that this activity correlates with reward measures, improved positive mood, and reduced sexual aversion. In addition, kisspeptin attenuates negative mood. This suggests that kisspeptin, in addition to its established role in the reproductive hormonal cascade, can also influence related sexual and emotional brain processing, thereby providing integration among reproduction, sexual responses, and bonding. These findings have important ramifications for our understanding of reproductive biology. Delineation of the precise neuronal networks by which kisspeptin exerts these effects will be an exciting field of future study, and recent advances in the use of optogenetics to stimulate endogenous kisspeptin neurones may serve as useful tools (49). Furthermore, in rodents, the kisspeptin receptor is necessary for male olfactory partner preference (62), with limbic kisspeptin neurones integrating into olfactory and reproductive circuits (6). This suggests that in humans, kisspeptin-olfactory processing may provide another area of future study. \n \n We observed that kisspeptin\u2019s enhancement of brain activity correlated with improvements in positive mood and reduced sexual aversion while kisspeptin also reduced negative mood. Therefore, this raises interesting directions for the pharmacological use of kisspeptin in disorders of sexual and emotional processing. For example, studies of kisspeptin administration in patients with depression and psychosexual disorders may prove fruitful as well as informing current work to develop kisspeptin as a potential therapeutic for common reproductive disorders, including male hypogonadism (56), hypothalamic amenorrhoea (54), and hyperprolactinaemia (63), and as a trigger for ovulation in in vitro fertilization (53). Therefore, our data also have important clinical relevance given the continued development of kisspeptin as a potential therapeutic. ||||| Mental Viagra\u2019 is on the horizon after scientists discovered that a hormone which surges during puberty can activate lust signals in the brain. \n \n The hormone kisspeptin essentially switches on the desire to reproduce and is linked to feeling sexy, romantic and turned on. It is thought to be responsible for the voracious sexual appetite of young people. \n \n Now scientists at Imperial College London have found that an injection of kisspeptin can trigger chemicals in the brain which occur when people feel amorous and aroused. \n \n They believe that pills containing the hormone could one day be used to treat sexual problems which are psychological \u2013 rather than physical. \n \n It could even help couples recapture the spark in a failing relationship. ||||| The British have a long history of censoring sex. In 1580, politician William Lambarde drafted the first bill to ban \"licentious\" and \"hurtful... books, pamphlets, ditties, songs, and other works that promote the art of lascivious ungodly love\". Last week, the UK government decided to have another crack at censorship, formally announcing that age verification for all online pornographic content will be mandatory from April 2018. \n \n It is unclear at this point what this mandatory check will entail, but it's expected that you will need to submit your credit card details to a site before being allowed to access adult content (credit cards can\u2019t be issued to under-18s). \n \n The appointed regulator will almost certainly be the British Board of Film Classification who will have the authority to levy fines of up to \u00a3250,000 or shut down sites that do not comply. These measures are being directly linked to research conducted by the NSPCC, the Children\u2019s Commissioner and the University of Middlesex in 2016, which surveyed more than 1,000 11 to 16-year-olds about viewing online pornography and found over half had accessed it. \n \n Digital minister Matt Hancock said age verification \"means that while we can enjoy the freedom of the web, the UK will have the most robust internet child protection measures of any country in the world\". And who can argue with that? No sane adult would think that it\u2019s a good idea for children to watch hardcore pornography. And because we all agree kids should be watching Peppa Pig rather than The Poonies, the act has been waved through virtually unchallenged. \n \n So, let\u2019s put the issue of hardcore pornography to one side, because surely we are all in agreement. I\u2019m asking you to look at the bigger picture. It\u2019s not just children who will be censored and it\u2019s not just Pornhub and Redtube which will be forced to age check UK viewers. This act will potentially censor any UK site that carries adult content, which is broadly defined by the BBFC as \"that it was produced solely or principally for the purposes of sexual arousal\". \n \n I am a UK academic and research the history of sexuality. I curate the online research project www.thewhoresofyore.com, where academics, activists, artists and sex workers contribute articles on all aspects of sexuality in the hope of joining up conversations around sex that affect everyone. The site also archives many historical images; from the erotic brothel frescoes of Pompeii to early Victorian daguerreotypes of couples having sex. And yet, I do not consider myself to be a porn baron. These are fascinating and important historical documents that can teach us a great deal about our own attitudes to sex and beauty. \n \n The site clearly signposts the content and asks viewers to click to confirm they are over 18, but under the Digital Economy Act this will not be enough. Although the site is not for profit and educational in purpose, some of the historical artefacts fit the definition of \"pornographic\u2019\" and are thereby liable to fall foul of the new laws. \n \n Thank you for your work in disproving that human, namely female sexuality is just some modern moral shortcoming. \u2014 Tiffany (@duafe) July 21, 2016 \n \n And I\u2019m not the only one; erotic artists, photographers, nude models, writers, sex shops, sex education sites, burlesque sites, BDSM sites, archivists of vintage erotica, and (of course) anyone in the adult industry who markets their business with a website, can all be termed pornographic and forced to buy expensive software to screen their users or risk being shut down or fined. I have contacted the BBFC to ask if my research will be criminalised and blocked, but was told \"work in this area has not yet begun and so we are not in a position to advice [sic] you on your website\". No one is able to tell me what software will need to be purchased if I am to collect viewers' credit card details, how I would keep them safe, or how much this would all cost. The BBFC suggested I contact my MP for further details. But, she doesn\u2019t know either. \n \n The thing I love most about @WhoresofYore: they beautifully show that humans have always been wonderfully sexual. https://t.co/Mb4Ma4uifv \u2014 Tagg (@taggianto) July 21, 2016 \n \n Before we even get into the ethical issues around adults having to enter their credit card details into a government database in order to look at legal content, we need to ask: will this work? Will blocking research projects like mine make children any safer? Well, no. The laws will have no power over social media sites such as Twitter, Snapchat and Periscope which allow users to share pornographic images. Messenger apps will still allow users to sext, as well as stream, send and receiving pornographic images and videos. Any tech savvy teenager knows that Virtual Private Network (VPN) software will circumvent UK age verification restrictions, and the less tech savvy can always steal their parents' credit card details. \n \n The proposed censorship is unworkable and many sites containing nudity will be caught in the crossfire. If we want to keep our children \"safe\" from online pornography, we need to do something we British aren\u2019t very good at doing; we need to talk openly and honestly about sex and porn. This is a conversation I hope projects like mine can help facilitate. Last year, Pornhub (the biggest porn site in the world) revealed ten years of user data. In 2016, Brits visited Pornhub over 111 million times and 20 per cent of those UK viewers are women. We are watching porn and we need to be open about this. We need to talk to each other and we need to talk to our kids. If you\u2019re relying on government censorship to get you out of that tricky conversation, you are letting your children down. \n \n The NSPCC report into children watching online pornography directly asked the participants about the effectiveness of age verification, and said the children \"pointed out its limitations\". When asked what intervention would most benefit them, this was the overwhelming response: \"Whether provided in the classroom, or digitally, young people wanted to be able to find out about sex and relationships and about pornography in ways that were safe, private and credible.\" I suggest we listen to the very people we are trying to protect and educate, rather than eliminate. \n \n Dr Kate Lister researches the history of sexuality at Leeds Trinity University",

And because these disorders can occur in patients who are infertile, researchers from Imperial College London report in the Journal of Clinical Investigation that kisspeptin could even play a role in helping couples struggling to conceive. The early-stage study began to lay the groundwork for that theory by testing how kisspeptin affects the brain's responses to sexual situations. To achieve this, researchers injected kisspeptin or a placebo into 29 healthy young men, explains a press release. When shown arousing images, MRI scans of the kisspeptin group revealed enhanced activity in brain regions associated with arousal compared to the placebo group. There was no such activity observed when non-sexual romantic images were shown. The lead author notes that most research and treatments for infertility focus on important biological factors, but that emotional processing is also key and \"only partially understood.\" Next up, they plan to expand the study's size and include women. Bonus trivia: Kisspeptin's name comes from Hershey, Pa., which is home to both Hershey\u2019s Kisses and the lab that in 1996 discovered the KiSS-1 gene that encodes kisspeptins, reports the New Statesman.

Kisspeptin is a protein that is released from the brain when a child's brain releases hormones that lead to the development of testes in boys and ovaries in girls, according to a new study. Scientists have known for a while that puberty begins with the release of these hormones, but little was known about kisspeptin until a few years ago, when it was discovered, Science Daily reports. Teens who lack the protein can't achieve puberty, but it has been shown to advance the age of puberty in rats and mice, and it's been found to help animals \u2013 A chemical called kisspeptin has been linked to a wide range of health issues, from fertility problems to cancer, and scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that it may also play a key role in the timing of puberty. Kisspeptin is a component of the male sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone. When the production of these hormones is turned off, breast cancers develop, nurtured by the sex hormones. If the tumors shrivel and die, the hormones should be turned off as well, reports Nature World News. The chemical is also present in a number of other biological systems, including the heart, liver, and lungs \u2013 A new study out of Imperial College London suggests that a hormone produced in the body can improve the brain's ability to process sexual arousal and romantic love. The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, used a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 29 healthy heterosexual young men were given an injection of kisspeptin, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the release of other reproductive hormones. They were then shown sexual and non-sexual romantic pictures of couples in an MRI scanner, while researchers scanned their brains to see how the hormone affected their brain responses. When the men were shown sexual or romantic \u2013 Can't get enough romantic love with your significant other? A new study suggests that an injection of the hormone kisspeptin could help. Researchers at the University of Imperial College London report in the Journal of Clinical Investigation that kissing activates parts of the brain associated with sexual and emotional processing.

When President Trump in October approved the release of previously classified or redacted documents on the JFK assassination, he blocked the release of others over national security concerns and gave federal agencies 180 days to re-review the withheld documents. The review in some cases turned up \"identifiable national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns,\" per a memo written by Trump, who on Thursday said some files would now be kept under wraps until Oct. 26, 2021. He wrote that some files are \"of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure,\" per the AP, but he ordered that they be reviewed over the next three years, and that any that can be released be made public immediately. The Dallas Morning News reports roughly 19,000 documents were released Thursday by the National Archives\u2014the largest batch thus far, notes the Hill; 520 remain fully sealed.

    "document": "This post has been updated. See below. \n \n A Groupon Super Bowl commercial that pokes fun at the political situation in Tibet has managed to offend viewers both in the U.S. and China, and may have consequences for the fast-growing Internet company's expansion plans. \n \n The ad features actor Timmothy Hutton narrating a mock public service announcement about Tibetans that quickly turns into an ad for the type of group-buying deals Groupon offers its customers: \"The people of Tibet are in trouble, their very culture in jeopardy,\" Mr. Hutton says in the ad. \"But they still whip up an amazing fish curry. And since 200 of us bought on Groupon.com we\u2019re getting $30 worth of Tibetan food for just $15 at Himalayan restaurant in Chicago.\u201d \n \n It has been rumored for weeks now that the Chicago-based company, which offers daily deals from local businesses, has its eyes on China, which boasts more Internet users than any other nation. Local media outlets have reported that Groupon is on a hiring spree and is in talks to partner with Chinese Internet giant Tencent. \n \n China\u2019s state-run newspaper China Daily reported today that a \u201cwell-placed source\u201d said Groupon is going to partner with Tencent to offer its services in China, and that the Chinese website will employ 1,000 people within three months. Tencent\u2019s own Web portal published a report (in Chinese) last month saying that Groupon is entering the China market and planning to hire many employees, while Ifeng.com, the web portal of Phoenix Television, said last month that Groupon and Tencent have jointly created a new website. \n \n None of those reports has been substantiated, with both Groupon and Tencent declining to comment. But if Groupon has aspirations in China, bringing up Tibet and saying its people are \u201cin trouble\u201d and that their \u201cvery culture is in jeopardy,\u201d even jokingly, isn\u2019t likely to please the Chinese officials whose blessing they'll need to set up operations. \n \n The Tibet ad was one of three the company aired during the Super Bowl, each of which makes fun of a different charitable cause. A statement on Groupon's official blog describes campaign as \"a parody of a celebrity-narrated, PSA-style commercial that you think is about some noble cause (such as 'Save the Whales'), but then it\u2019s revealed to actually be a passionate call to action to help yourself (as in 'Save the Money').\" Perhaps anticipating a certain level of public criticism, Groupon is offering to match donations to charities associated with the causes it parodies. \n \n In the case of Tibet, the charity is the Tibet Fund, an organization backed partially by the U.S. State Department and which works with Tibet\u2019s government in exile, the Central Tibetan Administration, that raises money for health care and education for Tibetan refugees. \n \n A copy of the ad with Chinese subtitles was reportedly posted on a Chinese video site not long after the spot aired in the U.S. but appears to have since been taken down. A number of Chinese Internet users were disapproving of the ad, slamming it as a bad business move and criticizing the company for mixing business with politics. \n \n \"Groupon's Super Bowl commercial with Tibet as its main theme is super offensive,\" one user called Wandering D wrote on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging service. \"Why did they have to link their commercials with politics?\" Another Sina Weibo user called nixiner quipped: \"Can anyone be more stupid than Groupon?\" The company \"made its first TV commercial as controversial as possible. Good job!\" \n \n While Tibetan independence is treated as a sensitive topic in China -- and treated as such by the country's Internet filtering system -- it is not a topic on which most Chinese citizens vocally disagree with the government. \n \n Politics aside, if Groupon does manage to start a Chinese website, it will have to compete with local group-buying start-ups like Letao.com that are gaining popularity. According to the China Internet Network Information Center, China had 18.75 million group-buying users by the end of 2010, and the category is likely to have \u201crapid growth\u201d in 2011. \n \n UPDATE, 10:35am Beijing time: An employee of SS PR, the public relations firm that represents Groupon, sent the following statement to CRT after this post was published: \"We wanted to clarify the intention of the Super Bowl ad yesterday. The humor was designed to draw attention to causes including Greenpeace, The Tibet Fund, and Rainforest Action Network. Groupon actually started as a collective action and philanthropy site (ThePoint.com). Collective action is in Groupon's DNA and this campaign pokes fun at its own roots.\" \n \n -- Loretta Chao with contributions from Yoli Zhang.

You'd have to be kind of heartless not to smile at that. It would be like heckling kittens. You knew eventually The Force would work for the kid, but the reveal is still funny.Fun gag, and relatable. This might be the funny one people talk about this week.More monkeys from Careerbuilder.com, the idea being once again how frustrating it is to work with idiots. An easy concept for which to have sympathy.Creepy funny is always good. And the guy addicted to Doritos cheese dust is definitely creepy.Best of the Pepsi MAX commercials. Quick to the punchline, funny ending.A lot of short gags in this one help make it funny. The actors are also good.When you have one joke, get to it and get out. This one didn't go over the top.Ozzy and Bieber were amusing. \"What's a Bieber?\" was a good line. Bieber had to be in the mix somewhere today -- he's everywhere else.Solid ad. Another one with a good string of gags, although distracting from the point of the product.This is another one people might talk about. Clever enough premise, visuals will help.Cheesy, but always good to see a wordless concept pulled off well.Loved this one. Animals are hit and miss, but this was cute. It helps if you have a good, short story to tell.An inspiring sentiment about Detroit with one of its biggest stars, Eminem. Hopefully Detroit isn't counting on Chrysler to bring it back. Much better than the other Eminem commercial, for Brisk.Not sure this is the change people are looking for from LivingSocial.com, but it's amusing.Animation is pretty impressive. 'World of Warcraft' fans might enjoy this. It's a nice change of pace from polar bears.Can we please be rid of these? There is a school of thought that says advertising doesn't have to be good or pleasing -- if it's memorable and you remember the product, you can hate the ad. GoDaddy.com is the leading practitioner of this philosophy.Apparently, moguls, sea gods, aliens and ancient civilizations don't have $14,000 to buy their own Kia. No one is buying \"an epic ride.\"Old people are funny! Sometimes they can't hear!The babies ads have been remarkably consistent. The streak ends here.Adrien Brody is an Oscar winner. Now he croons for beer commercials. That is sad enough to make me want to drink.A Pepsi MAX to the groin? Doesn't make me thirsty, or make me laugh.Who thought the Pug was in danger? Hands. No one? Who went to the kitchen for something other than Doritos during this spot? Hands. Smarter choice.Continuation of the diva theme. Doesn't outdo the Betty White/Abe Vigoda spot from last year.Kind of confused as to what the product is. Not curious to find out, even if it turns the fat thin, builds buildings and brokers peace between political factions.Eminem and tea aren't really a great match. Chrysler used Eminem much better.Peter Stormare stars in this centerpiece of the Bud campaign. Disappointing after having seen this spot hyped.This has the scale and length of a big Super Bowl ad, and \"test baby\" is funny. But it's hard to get excited about the possibility of cheaper hotels when there are a ton of sites doing this already. Not sure why HomeAway.com would be better from this ad.One of the longer spots, this one will be interesting to Mercedes aficionados for the variety of models. Diddy doesn't get to do much. If you're not already a fan of the vehicle, this is kind of a big shrug.This one will get a lot of attention for Kardashian. What you think of this commercial pretty much depends on how much you like watching her.Amusing reveal -- grandpa is funny. Still not terribly memorable.Making fun of rich people with a cameo by Kenny G. This is where most of America imagines Bernie Madoff has been assigned. Not bad, but again, not terribly memorable.No one is using a Xoom to create a better world.

(AP Photo/CareerBuilder.com) (Associated Press) \n \n A two-minute ad for Chrysler starring Eminem and a Volkswagen ad featuring a mini-Darth Vader that went viral before it even aired were two of the most talked-about spots during advertising's big night, Super Bowl XLV, in which Green Bay Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25. \n \n Chrysler was one of nine automakers that took advantage of advertising's biggest and most expensive showcase, at $3 million for 30 seconds, to try to show they're back after two tough years for the industry. \n \n The cinematic third-quarter Chrysler ad starred Eminem driving through Detroit and introduced a new car, the Chrysler 200 sedan, amid gritty scenes of the city. A voiceover talks about how the city has survived going through \"hell and back.\" \n \n \"This is the Motor City and this is what we do,\" Eminem says. \n \n The Chrysler ad was \"the big story of the night,\" according to NM Incite, a Nielsen/McKinsey Co. that tracks online buzz. \n \n Consumers repeated the \"imported from Detroit\" slogan over and over in online buzz, the company said. \n \n \"It was a very risky commercial, but it scored very well with our panel\" that rates the ads, said Tim Calkins, Clinical Professor of Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management. \n \n Another hit was a Volkswagen's ad that showed a boy in a Darth Vader costume trying to use \"The Force\" on objects, including the Passat. \n \n \"It really wasn't selling a car, it was selling a feeling, and it tapped into its target market of families very effectively, which you usually don't see in a car ad,\" said Robert Kolt, an instructor at Michigan State University College of Communication Arts & Sciences. \n \n Volkswagen released the ad early on Youtube.com and it had than 13 million views before the game even started. \n \n Elsewhere, celebrities and humor dominated. A scantily clad Kim Kardashian broke up with her trainer for Skechers, Roseanne Barr took a big hit from a log in a Snickers ad and comedian Joan Rivers, her head at least, became a GoDaddy girl. \n \n According to the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter, the best-scoring ads featured dogs: A Doritos ad that showed a man taunting a dog and getting smashed under a glass door, and a Bud Light ad that showed dogs catering a party. The newspaper uses a panel of viewers who rate the commercials as they watch them. \n \n After avoiding the Super Bowl for two years as it went in and out of a government-led bankruptcy, General Motors came back with five ads for Chevrolet. In one ad, a seemingly mundane car dealership ad is disrupted when a Camaro suddenly morphs into the Bumblebee character from the \"Transformers\" movies. \n \n One miss was daily coupon website Groupon's fake public service ad with Timothy Hutton, which appeared to be a plea for help for people of Tibet but instead touted a deal from Groupon for fish curry. \n \n While aiming for humor, \"It wasn't a very effective piece of communication and clearly rubbed some people the wrong way,\" Calkins said. \n \n A Homeaway.com ad featuring a \"test baby\" smushed against a window also garnered negative reaction from ad experts and \"didn't resonate with people,\" Calkins said. \n \n Some ads, predictably, drew criticism for being entertaining without doing much to sell people on the item being advertised. \n \n Among those was an ad for Lipton Brisk Iced Tea in which an animated Eminem explains why he doesn't usually do endorsements. He throws a business type off a roof when he refuses to rename the drink \"Eminem.\" \n \n \"It was confusing, and it didn't say a lot about the product,\" Calkins said. \n \n Not all ads went for laughs. Motorola Mobility's 60-second spot during the second quarter played off of the famous Apple ad \"1984.\" The dialogue-free Motorola ad shows a world where drones dress all in white and wear Apple iPod-like earbuds and a man uses a Motorola Xoom tablet to free and woo a girl. \n \n The message is that Apple has become an oppressor rather than a liberator, and show Motorola's tablet as a worthy opponent to Apple's popular iPad, said Bill Ogle, chief marketing officer of Motorola Mobility. \n \n \"A lot of people just try to go for laughs,\" he said. \"There are all kinds of sex and monkeys and horses (during the Super Bowl), but what we were trying to do is a bit more of a serious story.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n http://www.youtube.com/adblitz",

Local media outlets have reported that Groupon is on a hiring spree and is in talks to partner with Chinese Internet giant Tencent.

    "document": "BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 A man in Thailand upset with his wife hanged their 11-month-old daughter on Facebook Live and then killed himself, police said Tuesday. \n \n Police Col. Jirasak Siemsak said officers found the bodies of 20-year-old Wuttisan Wongtalay and the baby in an abandoned hotel in Phuket province after receiving reports of the video. \n \n \"He felt neglected by his wife because they had been fighting so he took his 11-month-old daughter to the site of the crime which is the abandoned hotel,\" Jirasak said. \"Then we found the bodies hanging off the hotel.\" \n \n The man made the broadcast Monday evening, and the video was made inaccessible by Facebook late Tuesday afternoon. \n \n \"The mother of the child was crying and was very sad,\" Jirasak said. \"I am also very sad. It is a personal dispute and they were still very young.\" \n \n The incident came less than two weeks after a man in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States broadcast himself on Facebook Live shooting a man to death. A series of other offensive broadcasts, including sexual assaults, has caused Facebook to seek ways to block such videos as quickly as possible. \n \n Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said last week that his company has \"a lot of work\" to do on the problem. \n \n The chief investigator in the Phuket case, Lt. Jula-at Suwannin, said police have yet to question Wuttisan's 20-year-old widow because they are giving her time to grieve. \n \n In Thailand, the potential for problems with Facebook Live became an issue last May when local media used the platform to broadcast live video of a university lecturer who was locked in a six-hour standoff with police who were seeking him in the shooting deaths of two colleagues. After negotiations for his surrender failed, he fatally shot himself with a handgun, a moment that was shown live. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption The deaths took place at a deserted hotel in Phuket \n \n A Thai man filmed himself killing his baby daughter on Facebook Live, before taking his own life, Thai police say. \n \n The 21-year-old hanged his daughter, and then himself, at a deserted hotel in Phuket on Monday, reportedly after an argument with his wife. \n \n Facebook sent condolences to the family for the \"appalling\" incident and said that the content had now been removed. \n \n The company pledged a review of its processes after footage of a US killing stayed online for hours this month. \n \n The footage of the Thai killing had also been available on video sharing website YouTube, but the company took it down after the BBC alerted it to its presence. \n \n Social media anger \n \n Relatives of the Thai man, Wuttisan Wongtalay, saw the distressing footage and alerted the police - but the authorities arrived too late to save him and his daughter. \n \n In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: \"This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim. There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed.\" \n \n Read more: \n \n Reuters said two videos were posted, at 16:50 (09:50 GMT) and 16:57 on Monday, and were taken down at about 17:00 on Tuesday, roughly 24 hours later. Facebook has yet to confirm the times to the BBC. \n \n Thailand's ministry of digital economy said it had contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos. \n \n Ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters: \"We will not be able to press charges against Facebook, because Facebook is the service provider and they acted according to their protocol when we sent our request. They co-operated very well.\" \n \n YouTube said it had taken down the video within 15 minutes of being told of its presence by the BBC. \n \n Its statement read: \"YouTube has clear policies that outline what's acceptable to post and we quickly remove videos that break our rules when they're flagged.\" \n \n Shortly before the BBC alerted YouTube, the video was showing 2,351 views. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US 'Facebook killer' manhunt - what happened? \n \n Thai social media users reacted with anger to the footage, while offering condolences to the family of the girl, BBC Thai editor Nopporn Wong-Anan says. \n \n Devastated relatives of the child, including the mother, picked up the body of the girl and her father from hospital on Tuesday. \n \n Following the US killing, Facebook said it was \"constantly exploring ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment\". \n \n \"We prioritise reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,\" blogged one of its executives last week. \n \n Separately on Tuesday, a court in Sweden jailed three men over the gang-rape of a woman in the city of Uppsala, 80km (50 miles) north of Stockholm, earlier this year and its live-streaming on Facebook. \n \n One man was jailed for two years and four months, and another for one year, both for rape. The third was jailed for six months for posting the rape on Facebook and failing to report it. \n \n Analysis: Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor \n \n This latest atrocity comes less than a fortnight after a US man bragged on Facebook Live about his murder of a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, having also posted a video of the killing to the social network. \n \n The platform's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently acknowledged he had \"a lot of work\" to do after it emerged the murder clip had remained online for more than two hours despite Facebook having received complaints in the meantime. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Zuckerberg commented on the Cleveland killing at a conference last week \n \n Prior to that, Facebook Live broadcast the death of a Chicago man who was shot in the neck and head last June, and then in July a woman streamed the death of her boyfriend after he was shot by police in Minneapolis. \n \n There have also been reports of sexual assaults, animal abuse and teenage suicide having been shown. \n \n For its part, Facebook is trying to find ways for its review team - which employs thousands of people - to react to such content more quickly. \n \n In addition, the firm has developed software to prevent such footage being reshared in full on its service at a later point. \n \n And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them. \n \n What it hasn't discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether. \n \n With Twitter and YouTube, among others, offering rival live-streaming products, doing so could put it at a disadvantage. \n \n But as a result, there will inevitably be further outrages and criticism because Facebook Live's popularity makes it all but impossible for the firm to keep a human eye over each broadcast. ||||| In Thailand, there was broad anger over the crime, which the police said appeared to have been driven by jealousy. Mr. Wongtalay had fought with his wife the night before the killing after searching her phone and accusing her of having another relationship. \n \n The video showed Mr. Wongtalay fixing a noose around his daughter\u2019s neck and then dropping her off the side of a building. After a burst of crying, he climbed over the side to retrieve her body. His subsequent suicide was not shown online. \n \n A second video of the police taking both of the bodies down that night remained on Facebook. \n \n Facebook has been under scrutiny for what role it should play in overseeing the billions of posts and videos that are uploaded on its site each day. Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, addressed the issue at a company conference this month in response to a case in which a man in Cleveland posted a video of himself shooting and killing a 74-year-old stranger. \n \n The deaths in Thailand highlight the global scope of the problem. As Facebook has pushed to further ensconce itself in the lives of its users, it has urged them to share their most intimate experiences on its site. That has resulted in a flood of posts and videos in different languages, cultural contexts and time zones across the world. Accidents and crimes have also occasionally shown up, and patrolling that has proved difficult. \n \n Last summer, an Italian wing-suit base jumper streamed his own death in an accident, while in January, three men in Sweden were arrested and accused of raping a woman and broadcasting it to a private Facebook group. In February, two journalists were fatally shot during a Facebook Live broadcast in the Dominican Republic.",

    "document": "Rescue workers stand at the wreckage site of a chartered airplane that crashed in a mountainous area outside Medellin, Colombia, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016. The plane was carrying the Brazilian first division... (Associated Press) \n \n LA UNION, Colombia (AP) \u2014 Colombia's worst air crash in two decades snuffed out a storybook run by a Brazilian soccer team, and authorities are digging in trying to figure out why a chartered jetliner crashed in the Andes, killing all but six of the 77 people aboard. \n \n The country's aviation agency said Tuesday that the British Aerospace 146's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder had been found among the wreckage strewn over a mountainside and were already being studied by experts. \n \n Initially, Colombian officials said the short-haul jet suffered an electrical failure, but there was also heavy rain when the crew declared an emergency and the plane disappeared from radar just before 10 p.m. Monday. \n \n Authorities also said they were not ruling out the possibility the aircraft ran out of fuel minutes before it was to land at Jose Maria Cordova airport outside Medellin, a report given to rescuers by a surviving flight attendant. Officials said they hoped to interview her Wednesday. \n \n Emotional pain resonated across the region over the loss of much of the Chapecoense soccer team from southern Brazil, which just two years after working its way into Brazil's top league for the first time in decades had fought its way into the championship of one of South America's most prestigious tournaments. \n \n The aircraft, which departed from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was carrying the team to Wednesday's first game in the two-game Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional of Medellin. Twenty-one Brazilian journalists were traveling with the team. \n \n South America's soccer federation canceled all scheduled matches in a show of solidarity, while the Real Madrid and Barcelona clubs interrupted their training sessions for a minute of silence. Brazil's top teams offered to lend players to the small club for next season as it rebuilds, saying: \"It is the minimum gesture of solidarity that is within our reach.\" \n \n In a moving gesture, Atletico Nacional asked that the championship title be given to Chapecoense, whose upstart run in the tournament electrified soccer-crazed Brazil. \n \n Three players were among the survivors. Alan Ruschel was reported in the most serious condition, facing surgery for a spinal fracture. Teammates Helio Zampier and Jakson Follmann also suffered multiple trauma injuries, and doctors had to amputate Follmann's right leg. \n \n A journalist also underwent surgery and two Bolivian crew members were in stable condition, hospital officials said. \n \n The aircraft is owned by LaMia, a charter company that started in Venezuela but later relocated to Bolivia, where it was certified to operate last January. Despite apparently limited experience, the airline has a close relationship with several premier South American soccer squads. \n \n Earlier this month, the plane involved in the crash transported Barcelona forward Lionel Messi and Argentina's national team from Brazil following a World Cup qualifying match. The airliner also appeared to have transported the national squads of Brazil, Bolivia and Venezuela in the last three months, according to a log of recent activity provided by Flightradar24.com. \n \n Before being taken offline, LaMia's website said it operated three 146 Avro short-haul jets made by British Aerospace, with a maximum range of around 2,965 kilometers (1,600 nautical miles) \u2014 about the distance between Santa Cruz and Medellin. \n \n Hans Weber, a longtime adviser to U.S. aviation authorities, said the aircraft's range deserves careful investigation. He noted that air distance between cities is usually measured by the shortest route but planes rarely fly in a straight line, with pilots steering around turbulence or changing course for other reasons. \n \n Given the model of the plane and the fact that it was flying close to capacity, \"I would be concerned that the pilots may have been cutting it too close,\" Weber said. \n \n A spokesman for Bolivia's civil aviation agency, Cesar Torrico, said the plane was inspected before departing for Colombia and no problems were reported. \n \n Gustavo Vargas, a retired Bolivian air force general who is president of the airline, said: \"We can't rule out anything. The investigation is ongoing and we're going to await the results.\" \n \n Moments before the plane took off, the team's coaching staff gave an interview to a Bolivian television station in which they praised the airline, saying it brought them good fortune when it flew them to Colombia last month for the championship's quarterfinals, which they won. \n \n \"Now we're going to do this new trip and we hope they bring us good luck like they did the first time,\" athletic director Mauro Stumpf told Gigavision TV. \n \n The team, from the small Brazilian city of Chapeco, was having a breakout season. It advanced to the Copa Sudamericana finals after defeating some of the region's top teams, including Argentina's San Lorenzo and Independiente. \n \n The Chapecoense club is so modest that tournament organizers ruled its 22,000-seat stadium was too small to host the concluding match of the two-game final and moved it to a stadium 300 miles (480 kilometers) to the city of Curitiba. Some fans in soccer-mad Brazil were so enchanted with its magical run that they started a campaign online to move the final match to Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana stadium, where the 2014 World Cup final was played. \n \n \"This morning I said goodbye to them and they told me they were going after the dream, turning that dream into reality,\" Chapecoense board member Plinio De Nes told Brazil's TV Globo. \"The dream was over early this morning.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Fernando Vergara reported this story in La Union, Colombia, and AP writer Joshua Goodman reported from Bogota. ||||| CORRECTS TO REMOVE DEATH TOLL OF 75 AFTER NUMBER OF DEATH TOLL WAS LOWERED BY COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS - Fans of Brazil's soccer team Chapecoense gather outside the Arena Conda stadium in Chapeco, Brazil,... (Associated Press) \n \n CHAPECO, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Thousands squeezed into Chapeco's cathedral and even more packed a stadium to mourn the death of 71 people in a plane crash, 19 of them members of the Chapecoense club who had been on the brink of soccer greatness. \n \n \"To lose (almost) all of them in such a tragic way, totally destroyed our city and each one of us,\" Carla Vilembrini said late Tuesday, standing outside Santo Antonio Cathedral. She was dressed like so many others \u2014 in the club's green and white jerseys. \n \n Chapecoense's fantasy season ended on a muddy Colombian mountainside late Monday when a chartered aircraft crashed south of Medellin. Only six of the 77 passengers and crew survived, three of them players. \n \n The club was having the best season in its 43-year history, heading to the first of two matches in the final of the Copa Sudamericana, the continent's No. 2 club tournament. \n \n Distraught residents of this southern Brazilian city of 200,000 people, an agribusiness center near the Argentina border, wandered the streets around the stadium \u2014 known as Arena Conda \u2014 in stunned silence. \n \n \"The city is very quiet,\" businessman Cecilio Hans said. \"People will only believe once the bodies start to arrive.\" \n \n On social media, haunting last photos showed the smiling players boarding the flight to Colombia for their match with Atletico Nacional. \n \n In one photo, the team celebrated a last-minute save by goalkeeper Danilo only a week ago against the Argentine club San Lorenzo. The save guaranteed Chapecoense a spot in the final \u2014 and ultimately cost Danilo his life in the crash. \n \n \"I can't still believe it,\" Alan Heinz said inside the stadium, his body pressed against the fence that separates fans from the field. This time the field was filled by a religious service and prayers for the dead. \n \n \"I was preparing for the best day of my life, and now I don't know what my life will be after this,\" he said. \n \n As recently as 2009, the club known as Chape was playing in Brazil's fourth division, but it won promotion to the top league in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s. \n \n Victories over San Lorenzo and Independente \u2014 two of Argentina's fiercest squads \u2014 as well as the Colombian club Junior took the team to the Copa Sudamericana finals, the equivalent of the UEFA Europa League tournament. \n \n Few of the players had an international profile, and none had any appearances with Brazil's glitzy national team. Most had played all over Brazil and Latin America. Only a few had ever reached Europe, like Cleber Santana, who played for Atletico Madrid in 2007-10. \n \n Chape strikers Bruno Rangel and Kempes, both 34, were among the top scorers in the Brazilian league, with 10 and nine goals, respectively. \n \n The only players to survive were goalkeeper Jakson Follmann, defender Helio Zampier, commonly known as Neto, and defender-midfielder Alan Ruschel. \n \n Coach Caio Junior is credited with Chape's quick rise, joining the club this year after guiding teams in the Middle East. Born Luiz Carlos Saroli, he coached numerous Brazilian teams, including Palmeiras, Flamengo and Botafogo. \n \n He was among the dead. His son, Matheus Saroli, escaped because he didn't make the flight, saying in a Facebook post that he couldn't board \"because I forgot my passport.\" \n \n An Argentine player on the club, Alejandro Martinuccio, also missed the flight, because of an injury during a game, he told Argentina's La Red radio. \n \n \"I feel deep sadness. The only thing I can ask is prayers for the companions who were on the flight,\" he said. \n \n Also among the dead were 20 sports journalists, including Mario Sergio Pontes de Paiva, a former player who worked as a commentator for Fox Sports. He played briefly for Brazil's national team in the early 1980s and had a long career as a midfielder and coach with many Brazilian clubs. He last coached Brazilian club Internacional in 2009 and Ceara in 2010. \n \n \"This is a very, very sad day for football,\" FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. \"At this difficult time our thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends.\" \n \n Brazilian President Michel Temer declared three days of official mourning, while soccer great Pele called it a \"tragic loss.\" Brazilian champion Palmeiras asked the country's football confederation for permission to wear Chapecoense's jersey in its last match of the season. \n \n Around the world, the sport paused to remember the victims. \n \n Barcelona and Real Madrid held a minute of silence before their practice sessions during the day, and France's top two leagues observed be a minute's silence at Tuesday night's games. \n \n Medellin-based Atletico Nacional said it was asking the South American soccer confederation to give the Copa Sudamericana title to Chape as a tribute to the players who died. \n \n Some of Brazil's top clubs said they wanted to lend players to Chape for the 2017 season. They also said the team should not be relegated to the second division as it recovers from the disaster. \n \n \"The dream is not over. We will fight back when it's time,\" said Chape's acting club president, Gelson Della Costa. \n \n \"Now it's time to take care of the families,\" he said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press sports writer Mauricio Savarese reported this story in Chapeco, Brazil, and AP sports writer Stephen Wade reported from Rio de Janeiro. ||||| The trip to Medellin, Colombia, was supposed to be a joyous one for the members Chapecoense, a soccer club from the small city of Chapeco, Brazil, and they were in the middle of a fairy tale season. \n \n Now their journey will go down in history as a tragedy. \n \n Investigators will likely comb through the evidence for the next several months, hoping to discover why a charter flight crashed Monday night while carrying players, coaches, board members and journalists. The accident killed 71 people, officials said, revising the death toll from the initial figure of 75. Officials said six survived. \n \n Details are scarce, and it will take a significant amount of time for officials to determine the exact causes of the crash. However, information available soon after the crash point toward the pilots facing the worst of circumstances. \n \n The charter flight departed Bolivia on Monday just before 6:20 p.m. local time. A little over four hours later, the flight began what appears to be a holding pattern just south of the Medellin airport for about 13 minutes. According to flight data from FlightRadar24, the plane made three circles, descending from 21,000 feet to 15,550 feet for the last two minutes of available flight data. \n \n The flight's destination, Maria Cordova International Airport outside Medellin, is a notoriously difficult airport for pilots. The runway is at 7,000 feet, surrounded by mountainous terrain. Frequent adverse weather conditions can make visibility difficult. \n \n Approaching an airport at that elevation requires high approach speeds, creating an even greater challenge in poor conditions. \n \n Fotos de @AerocivilCol aeronave procedente Aeropuerto Viru Viru de Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia empresa Lamia matr\u00edcula CP2933 RJ 80. pic.twitter.com/ZKngqObQ5v \u2014 AERON\u00c1UTICA CIVIL (@AerocivilCol) November 29, 2016 \n \n There were scattered thunderstorms in the area at the time of the crash, and turbulence could have been present, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. \n \n The airport's official Twitter account confirmed the plane suffered an electrical failure before the crash. \n \n While the consequences of an electrical failure can vary greatly, if the pilots lost navigational aids on approach to an airport like Medellin at night in poor visibility, that could spell serious trouble. \n \n The limited evidence available at this time suggests some possible scenarios for the doomed flight. For insight into the incident, ABC News spoke with Col. Steve Ganyard \u2014 a former deputy assistant secretary of state, a retired fighter pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps and an ABC News contributor. \n \n The holding pattern seen on flight data could indicate the crew was attempting to troubleshoot the electrical failure. So late in the flight, however, the plane may have been low on fuel, forcing the crew to make a quick decision in poor weather surrounded by high terrain. Such a combination could have been perilous. \n \n \"An electrical failure under those conditions would challenge even the best pilots,\" Ganyard said. \"And if there was a total electrical failure, the flight was doomed.\" \n \n #AEstaHora Carlos Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez P\u00e9rez, Director de la UNGRD, realiza seguimiento a operaci\u00f3n de b\u00fasqueda y rescate en la zona del siniestro. pic.twitter.com/SsfOEBZDQt \u2014 UNGRD (@UNGRD) November 29, 2016 \n \n Under those conditions, a visual approach would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible. In such a case, a pilot would resort to the often used ILS, or instrument landing system. \n \n ILS allows the pilots to use radio signals to navigate the plane safely to the runway, even through poor visibility. \n \n A total electrical outage, although rare, would take this option away from the pilots. \n \n Investigators will surely look very closely at the reported electrical outage and why such an event may have occurred. \n \n Ganyard added that air safety in South America is relatively poor. \"A Bolivian charter aircraft was not likely maintained or manned to U.S. standards,\" he said. \n \n As the recovery mission is ongoing, fans and surviving team staff are remembering those who died. \n \n In an early morning tweet on Tuesday, the team shared a video of the players celebrating a recent victory with a simple caption: \u201cMay this be the last image of our warriors. #ChapeStrength.\u201d \n \n Que essa seja a \u00faltima imagem dos nosso guerreiros.#For\u00e7aChape pic.twitter.com/Q1ZxF5h4sV \u2014 Chapecoense (@ChapecoenseReal) November 29, 2016 \n \n ABC News contributor Col.

ONE\u00ae Condoms launches myONE\u00ae Perfect Fit, a game-changing new product line of 60 different condom sizes. Now available in the United States, myONE Perfect Fit offers condoms with combinations of 10 lengths and 9 widths. These include sizes smaller and larger than what was previously available to condom users in America. With 60 condom sizes, myONE is designed to finally address the top complaints about condoms: they don\u2019t fit and are uncomfortable. \n \n Does size matter? \n \n It\u2019s no secret than many people don\u2019t like to use condoms. Common complaints focus on issues related to fit and feel, such as the condom being too loose, tight, short or long. Poor condom fit is a contributing factor to loss of sensation, loss of erection, and difficulty achieving orgasm. In cases where the condom slips off or is removed prematurely, there is an increased risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \n \n Surprisingly, previously available condoms properly fit only 12 percent of men. Here are some examples of the problems that people face with existing condoms: \n \n Condoms too long: Most condoms are nearly 7 inches long\u2014more than one inch too long for the average penis (5.57 inches). In one study sample of 1,661 men in the United States, 82.83 percent of participants had a penis shorter than the length of a standard condom. As a result, for many men the condom will not unroll completely, causing a rubber-band effect at the base of the penis\u2014resulting in tightness and discomfort. If the condom does unroll, the extra length can hang off the tip of the penis and potentially cause it to slip or be pulled off. \n \n Condoms too short: Even though most condoms are longer than the average penis, there are many people that have a penis that is longer than existing XL condoms. This leaves the base of the penis unprotected from skin-to-skin transmission of STIs. \n \n \n \n \n \n Condoms too wide (loose): People who have a penis smaller in circumference than existing condoms often report issues related to the condom slipping off. \n \n Condoms too tight: Previously available XL condoms are only a few millimeters wider than the standard condom. For men who are significantly thicker than average, they will not notice a significant improvement with existing XL condoms. \n \n MyONE Perfect Fit solves these issues by offering a range of 60 condom sizes that will provide a better fit for 9 out of 10 men. These include 28 sizes larger than the leading XL condom and 27 sizes smaller than the average condom\u2014in terms of length, width or both. MyONE lengths range from 4.9 to 9.4 inches, while prior condoms available ranged from 6.7 to 8.3 inches in length. The circumferences available from myONE range from 3.5 to 5.0 inches, while prior condoms available ranged from 3.9 to 4.5 inches. \n \n \u201cAfter years of dedication and hard work, we are thrilled to announce a condom that will finally address complaints about fit,\u201d said Davin Wedel, president of ONE Condoms. \u201cYou might be able to squeeze your large hands into a size-small glove, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will be comfortable to wear. We want the world to know you shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice comfort for safety when it comes to condoms. Whether big, small or in between, myONE has a condom perfect for you.\u201d \n \n Bringing myONE to market: regulatory and manufacturing challenges \n \n Condoms are classified as Class II medical devices under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and conform to safety and testing standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and ASTM International. Previously, the only testing standard that existed for new condoms was based on the one-size-fits-all model. This meant that all condoms sold in the United States prior to myONE were required to be at least 6.7 inches long and between 1.9 and 2.2 inches wide in nominal width, which did not accurately reflect the wide range of penis sizes. \n \n Bringing myONE Perfect Fit to the U.S. market has been an ongoing process, spanning over seven years, and has required extensive work among researchers, standards organizations, and ONE\u2019s R&D and manufacturing experts. This effort resulted in updated testing standards and the eventual FDA clearance for myONE Perfect Fit in the United States. \n \n Offering 60 different condom sizes is also a major manufacturing challenge, because it requires the creation of cylindrical glass moulds in all the 60 different sizes. Normally, over 3,000 expensive glass molds are on a production line for each size of condom. Therefore, having 60 different sizes is not only incredibly expensive, but the time to change the lines over is a challenge. \n \n \u201cAlthough manufacturing myONE is a significant investment and required specialized manufacturing processes and equipment to be developed, we are strongly invested in myONE and its potential to increase condom use overall,\u201d said Davin Wedel. \n \n Public health impact \n \n ONE was founded on the principle of promoting safer sex through condom innovation and design. MyONE is the next evolution in condoms and allows men who have previously not been satisfied with the fit of standard condoms to have a more pleasurable experience. \n \n \u201cMyONE has the potential to change people\u2019s perception of condoms and ultimately, reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and STI occurrences,\u201d says Davin Wedel. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to bringing a smart solution to market by offering comfortable condoms at affordable pricing. In fact, we\u2019re giving away 1 million condoms to help men find their fit.\u201d \n \n The effect that myONE may have on public health efforts is particularly important to Wedel, who founded the company in 1987 with a mission to make condoms as socially acceptable as toothpaste in an effort to prevent the transmission of HIV. \n \n How to purchase \n \n Get It Up, Size It Up, Order It Up. In order to buy myONE Perfect Fit condoms, customers use a FitKit or a measuring tape to measure their length and circumference, and receive a unique product code that corresponds to their myONE size.

Little is known about the process of self-measurement and whether the behaviors a man engages in to become erect for self-measurement are associated with his erect penile dimensions. \n \n AIMS: \n \n The article aims to assess men's erect penile dimensions in a study in which the men would presumably be motivated to report accurate information about their penis size; and to explore associations between men's erect penile dimensions, their method of measurement, and their demographics. \n \n METHODS: \n \n Data are from an Internet-based baseline phase of a large prospective daily diary study that compared men's use of a standard-sized condom to men's use of a condom sized to fit their erect penis. \n \n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \n \n The main outcomes are participant characteristics, activities engaged in during self-measurement process, and self-reported erect penile length and circumference. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n For this sample of 1,661 men, the mean erect penile length was 14.15 cm (SD = 2.66; range = 4 to 26 cm), and the mean erect penile circumference was 12.23 cm (SD = 2.23; range = 3 to 19). Participant characteristics were not associated with measured length or circumference. Most men measured their penis while alone, using hand stimulation to become erect. \n \n CONCLUSIONS: \n \n In this sample of men who measured their erect penile length and circumference for the purposes of receiving a condom sized to fit their erect penis, we found a mean erect penile length of 14.15 cm and a mean erect penile circumference of 12.23 cm. The self-reported erect penile dimensions in this study are consistent with other penile dimension research. Also, findings suggest that mode of getting an erection may influence erect penile dimensions. Additionally, how a man becomes erect for self-measurement may be associated with his erect penile length and/or circumference. \n \n \u00a9 2013 International Society for Sexual Medicine. ||||| Condoms get a bad rap for being a bad wrap. Men often complain of discomfort, diminished sensation and poor fit. A recent federal study found only a third of American men use them. \n \n Now, changes by the Food and Drug Administration and industry-standards groups have opened the door to the condom equivalent of bespoke suits. A Boston-based company has begun selling custom-fit condoms in 60 sizes, in combinations of 10 lengths and nine circumferences. \n \n Will the development improve the appeal of condoms, the only birth-control method that protects against most sexually transmitted diseases? Public health experts are unsure. \n \n Many ideas for improving condoms have fizzled, sometimes stymied by the costs of testing required to satisfy the F.D.A., which considers condoms to be medical devices.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Consider these two numbers: 5.57 inches and 6.69. The first is the average erect penile length, according to a study of 1,661 American men. The latter is the minimum length that standard condoms have been required to be. If that seems like a disconnect, well, it is, and change is coming\u2014though not without some difficulty. In a look at the condom industry, the New York Times explains that revolution is challenging in large part because of the Food and Drug Administration. It classifies condoms as medical devices, which means any new product has to go through pricey clinical trials to gain approval. Case in point: The Gates Foundation gave Mark McGlothlin $100,000 to pursue his idea of making condoms from things like cow tendon, but he's far short of the $2 million he says the trials would cost. And the makeup of the tests themselves have been problematic. One is called the \"hang-and-squeeze,\" and it's much like it sounds like: A condom is filled with water and then squeezed to look for leakage. But make a condom for the 5.57-inch\u2014or less\u2014man, and filling it with the required water volume doesn't work. The FDA and two standards organizations have started to acknowledge the limitations and tweak the requirements and tests, and that's opened the door for Boston-based Global Protection Corp. to begin selling condoms that come in 60 sizes. Per a press release, 28 of those sizes are larger than the length, width, or both of the \"leading XL condom,\" while 27 are smaller than the typical one.

The objective of this analysis was to examine 45-year trends in time-use, household management (HM) and energy expenditure in women. Design and Participants Using national time-use data from women 19\u201364 years of age, we quantified time allocation and household management energy expenditure (HMEE) from 1965 to 2010. HM was defined as the sum of time spent in food preparation, post-meal cleaning activities (e.g., dish-washing), clothing maintenance (e.g., laundry), and general housework. HMEE was calculated using body weights from national surveys and metabolic equivalents. Results The time allocated to HM by women (19\u201364 yrs) decreased from 25.7 hr/week in 1965 to 13.3 hr/week in 2010 (P<0.001), with non-employed women decreasing by 16.6 hr/week and employed women by 6.7 hr/week (P<0.001). HMEE for non-employed women decreased 42% from 25.1 Mj/week (6004 kilocalories per week) in 1965 to 14.6 Mj/week (3486 kcal/week) in 2010, a decrement of 10.5 Mj/week or 1.5 Mj/day (2518 kcal/week; 360 kcal/day) (P<0.001), whereas employed women demonstrated a 30% decrement of 3.9 Mj/week, 0.55 Mj/day (923 kcal/week, 132 kcal/day) (P<0.001). The time women spent in screen-based media use increased from 8.3 hr/week in 1965 to 16.5 hr/week in 2010 (P<0.001), with non-employed women increasing 9.6 hr/week and employed women 7.5 hr/week (P<0.001). Conclusions From 1965 to 2010, there was a large and significant decrease in the time allocated to HM. By 2010, women allocated 25% more time to screen-based media use than HM (i.e., cooking, cleaning, and laundry combined). The reallocation of time from active pursuits (i.e., housework) to sedentary pastimes (e.g., watching TV) has important health consequences. These results suggest that the decrement in HMEE may have contributed to the increasing prevalence of obesity in women during the last five decades. \n \n Citation: Archer E, Shook RP, Thomas DM, Church TS, Katzmarzyk PT, et al.

Etiologies of Obesity and Energy Balance The origins of the obesity epidemic are in dispute [3]. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that increments in body weight and adiposity, at the most fundamental level, are the result of chronic positive energy balance (i.e., energy expenditure [EE]<energy intake [EI]) [4]. While this imbalance may be engendered via decrements in EE (e.g., diminished physical activity) and/or increments in EI, the imprecision of current methods for measuring population-level EI [5], [6], [7] and EE [8] limits the accurate quantification of the energy balance equation. Therefore, data on population-level trends in risk factors (e.g., physical activity, PA) [9] may provide essential contextual evidence by which to inform public policy. Energy intake and obesity. Given the lack of reliable data on population-level EI [5], [6], [7], recent publications have suggested that superficial food economics (e.g., alterations in food supply or food costs) are responsible for the obesity epidemic [10], [11]. This unidimensional determinism (i.e., economic forces cause obesity) is implausible given two well-established facts. First, humans adapt physiologically and behaviorally to perturbations in energy balance via an array of compensatory homeostatic mechanisms [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and second, while food supply forces (e.g., availability, price) affect purchase and perhaps utilization and waste, the mere presence of food and over-consumption of food are simply necessary but not sufficient conditions for long-term changes in adiposity [13], [15], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. This is most clearly demonstrated in countries in which the food energy supply increased [21], [22], [23] while BMI levels were stable or decreasing [22], [24], [25], and the converse context in early 20th century US in which the food supply was decreasing [26] while BMI was increasing [27]. Given the homeostatic nature of human behavior and energy physiology, and the fact that physical activity and body composition determine nutrient partitioning (i.e., the metabolic fate of the food we consume), we postulate that it is highly unlikely that the obesity epidemic is the result of superficial food economics. Data on population-level trends. The complex, multi-dimensional nature of the obesity epidemic and lack of valid data on population trends in EI [5], [6], [7] necessitates examinations of trends in population-level risk factors if public health policy is to be informed by the best available science. Recent publications have concluded that PA has not declined over the recent past despite two major limitations. First, these studies focused on highly selected, non-representative samples and used indirect, inherently confounded measures of PA such as the physical activity level (PAL) index (which conflates all non-resting EE with PA) [28]. Second, most previous empirical work examined domains of PA that account for only a small portion of total EE [29]. In 2011, Church et al., examined occupational EE via US Bureau of Labor Statistics\u201d surveys that included data on employment and earnings from more than 140,000 businesses, government agencies and >440,000 individual worksites, and found a significant decreasing trend over the past 50 years. They concluded that the reduction in this single domain of PA may account for a considerable portion of the increase in mean body weights for men and women [30]. The present study sought to complement Church et al.\u201ds results by providing longitudinal data on another domain of PA: household management (HM). Since Church et al.\u201ds work on occupational EE explained more of the increase in weight for men than women, and nearly all women (but not the majority of men) perform HM activities on a daily basis [31], we posited that a greater portion of women\u201ds EE may be from HM. To test the hypothesis that trends in the time allocated to HM may contribute to longitudinal decrements in EE and potentially to gains in weight or adiposity, we examined nationally representative time-use diary data sources to analyze 45-year trends in the allocation of time, HM activities (e.g., meal preparation, laundry, and cleaning) and energy expenditure in women. \n \n Methods The Allocation of Time Data on women\u201ds\u201d allocation of time were derived from nationally representative time-use diary data from 1965\u20132010. Time-use data have been demonstrated to be more reliable and valid for non-occupational PA than other traditional surveillance systems [32]. Importantly, this data source provides details that allow an examination of the reallocation of time between activities (i.e., activity displacement). For example, if individuals spend less time cooking and cleaning, they may spend more time exercising, sleeping, or watching television TV. The American Heritage Time Use Study (AHTUS) [33] database was the source of nationally representative historical time-use data, and provided harmonized data on specific activities relevant to HM. The AHTUS dataset was produced specifically to analyze trends in total work output (i.e., paid and unpaid work) [34]. The harmonization process standardized multiple sources of data into a unified context for the purpose of comparative analyses. This process is complex and detailed information is provided by Fisher et al. (2011) [33] and Egerton et al. (2005) [34]. The AHTUS datasets consist of >50,000 diary days from 1965\u20132010. The number of weighted diaries from women (age 19\u201364 years) available for analysis were: 1036 for 1960s, 1924 for 1970s, 1420 for 1980s, 4117 for 1990s, 17,885 for 2003\u20132005, and 23,900 for 2006\u20132010. Time-use data sources were divided into four areas: 1) paid work, 2) household (e.g., unpaid housework and family care), 3) personal care (e.g., grooming), and 4) free time (e.g., TV viewing, exercise). Time-use data were analyzed for the change in the amount of time spent in each area by examining >90 subcategories of daily activity. Our final analyses included only those activities that significantly affected total daily EE over the 45-year period. For this investigation, household management activities were comprised of the aggregate time spent preparing food (e.g., cooking, washing dishes), general cleaning (e.g., vacuuming), clothing maintenance (i.e., laundry) but not general child or adult care, vehicle or house maintenance (e.g., painting), gardening or lawn care. Screen-based media use was defined as the non-occupational use of television and computer during free time, and leisure time physical activity (LTPA) was defined as sport and exercise participation. Employment status and age. Employment impacts the time allocated to HM [31], [35], [36]. For this study, the terms \u201cemployed\u201d and \u201cnon-employed\u201d encompassed all women and referred to the respondent\u201ds self-reported employment status based on paid work hours per week. Full time employment was >21 hr of paid work per week for 1965\u20131990 and >35 hr/week for 1990\u20132010. Age also impacts HM activities; therefore, the sample was divided into age groups (i.e., <35 years, 35\u201350 years, >50 years old). Energy expenditure associated with activity. HM consists of numerous tasks of varying intensity and EE. The data used in this study did not have the detail necessary to delineate between the various components of HM. As such, a conservative Metabolic Equivalents (MET) value of 2.8 was assigned to HM activities. This value represents the EE per unit of time and was based on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Health Organization and United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU) report on human food energy requirements [37], [38] and the 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities [39]. Walking (2\u20134 METs) accounted for the vast majority of LTPA in the AHTUS and US population [40], [41], [42]. Nevertheless, a liberal MET value of 4.5 was used for all LTPA to account for the infrequent occurrence of activities of higher intensity. Energy expenditure and body mass. Increased body mass increases EE at rest and during PA. Since women were heavier in 2010 than in 1965, increments in the body weight used for the estimation of the HMEE and LTPA for each epoch were necessary. These increments were calculated from national surveys (NHES:1960\u201362; NHANES: 1971\u201374, 1976\u201380, 1988\u201394, 1999\u20132002 and 2003\u20132010) for the age group 19 to 64 [43]. The NHANES provides a representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population via a complex, probability sampling design. The estimated body weights used for each epoch were 1960s = 65 kg; 1970s = 66 kg; 1980s = 69 kg; 1990s = 71 kg; 2005 = 74 kg; 2010 = 75 kg. As per previous research on PA [30] and the 2011 Compendium [39], the estimated EE for each activity and time period was calculated from the equation: EE = (hours in activity per week x MET value for activity x mean body weight). Statistical Analyses Data processing and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V\u00b719 in 2012. Decade-to-decade contrasts and trend analyses were conducted for HMEE and the allocation of time to HM, screen-based media, LTPA. Analyses accounted for the survey design via the incorporation of weighting to maintain a nationally representative sample. All analyses included adjusted means, and p<0.05 (2-tailed) indicated statistical significance. \n \n Discussion From 1965 to 2010, there was a large and significant decline in the time women allocated to HM (figure 1). By the 1990s, women spent more time in screen-based media use (e.g., watching TV) than in cooking, cleaning, laundry and LTPA combined. A major consequence of the 12 hr/week decline in HM was a considerable decrement in HMEE, with non-employed women experiencing the largest decrease (10.5 Mj/week, 1.5 Mj/day; 2518 kcal/week, 360 kcal/day; figure 3). In parallel with the considerable decline in HMEE was a substantial increase in the amount of time spent in screen-based media use (8.3 hr/week), and a smaller but statistically significant increase in LTPA (1.2 hr/week) (figure 4). Technology has played a large part in the decline in HM hr/week [35], [44], [45]. As automation improved the efficiency and decreased the requisite exertion of household tasks, the greatest decrements in HMEE were in individuals who previously allocated the greatest amount of time to HM (e.g., \u201cstay-at-home\u201d moms). Advances in food manufacturing led to an increase in the use of prepackaged, microwaveable meals and a consequent decrease in the time spent preparing food [46], [47]. In 1970, less than 1% of all homes had a microwave oven and <20% a dishwasher; by 2005, more than 90% of homes had a microwave and >60% a dishwasher. Post-meal clean-up was minimized (via disposable food containers) and mechanized (via the dishwasher) so individuals had the freedom to perform other activities (e.g., watch TV). Another development relevant to food preparation was the increased reliance on the food service industry. In 2000, nearly 50% of all food costs were spent on food away from home, compared with <30% in 1965, despite the decreasing relative costs of restaurant foods [46], [48]. One of the most dominant factors in the decrement of HMEE over time appears to be the change in women\u201ds social roles. Early in the 20th century, women allocated the vast majority of their time to unpaid HM activities. Beginning in the 1950s, women began to divide their time between unpaid HM activities and paid employment [49]. From 1950 to 2000, women\u201ds full-time employment increased from 34% to 60% [50] and the full-time employment of mothers with children increased from 19 to 57 percent [36], [51]. This demographic transition lead to a decrease in the time women allocated to HM, child care, and personal care [31], [35], and dramatically decreased the amount of time that working women with children allocated to HM. Mothers who are employed full-time perform less childcare (8 hr/week), less housework (10 hrs/week) and achieve less sleep (~3 hr/week) than non-employed or part-time working mothers. [35], [36], [52] This shift from more active (i.e., energetically costly) activities such as HM to more sedentary occupational activities has an obvious impact of energy expenditure and health. [9], [30], [53] The resulting decrease in HM and HMEE was only partially offset by the increases in LTPA. Energy Balance, Obesity and Health Given the complexity of human behavior and the behavioral and physiological compensatory mechanisms engendered by alterations in energy balance, there are no models that allow valid extrapolations from decreases in HMEE to increments in population-level weight-gain. Nevertheless, the declines in HM-hr/week and HMEE parallel the increments in screen-based media use suggesting that as the overall time and energy spent on PA decreased, the amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors increased. Intergenerational Effects of Inactivity Given the intergenerational effects of inactivity on metabolic function, health and obesity [54], [55], [56], the dramatic decreases in HM and HMEE may result in ever-increasing increments in obesity and NCDs in subsequent generations. Recent research has demonstrated that a majority of pregnant women spend more than 50% of their waking hours in sedentary behavior and that >15% of pregnant women have reported spending more than 5 hr/day in screen-based media use [57], [58]. The trend of the reallocation of time from active behaviors such as HM to sedentary activities has obvious and significant health consequences for future generations [9], [53]. Population Trends and Obesity The confluence of our results and research on other PA domains (e.g., transport [59], occupational [30], housework [44], sedentary behavior [60]) suggests a considerable decrement in total PA and substantial increases in sedentary behavior during the past few decades. This growing body of research suggests that the rise in bodyweight and obesity may be due to decreases in PA alone. In fact, these data from multiple PA domains suggest that the decrement in EE may be so large that current levels of obesity would be significantly higher if compensatory responses (e.g., decreased EI or increased LTPA) were absent. Strengths and Limitations Strengths. This study represents the first detailed analyses of trends in HMEE derived from nationally representative historical time-use databases. HMEE was derived using an empirically supported protocol for the translation of PA into EE [39], [61]. Our results on the allocation of time to HM, LTPA and screen-based media use are in agreement with other research [33], [52], [62], [63]. Furthermore, we used a conservative estimate of the mean intensity of household activities (i.e., 2.8 METs) based on the convention established by the FAO/WHO/UNU in 1985 [37] since the available data did not have the level of detail necessary to calculate EE for each specific component of HM. Importantly, the use of this value facilitates future examinations of HMEE across developed nations. Moreover, our results on activity displacement (i.e., the reallocation of time away from HM to sedentary pursuits) are bolstered by investigations independent of the AHTUS datasets demonstrating decreased HM [64], and Nielsen research that suggests that TV viewing has increased at a rate greater than indicated in our findings [65], [66]. Limitations. The two most significant limitations are the use of harmonized datasets and self-reported data. The harmonization process of the datasets is complex and was not performed by our research group. Nevertheless, the process is quite robust and there are hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and academic texts that used these harmonized datasets (see http://www.timeuse.org). The biases associated with self-reported data are not trivial and limit our results; especially biases induced via social desirability and the cognitive demands of recording the allocation of time. Nonetheless, these biases may be omnipresent and stable, and therefore may not present a significant threat to our analysis of trends. For example, TV viewing was not considered a socially desirable behavior throughout the period of study [66], [67]; as such, the self-reported increments in screen-based media use over five decades lend support to our contention that longitudinal trends may be less affected than analyses of static cross-sectional data. Additionally, our analyses accounted only for the time allocated to HM and not how technological advances (e.g., self-propelled vacuum cleaners, food processors) have altered the effort (i.e., intensity) of HM. Accelerometry and indirect calorimetry research [68], [69], [70] suggest higher estimates for specific components of HM activities than either the 2011 Compendium [39] or FAO/WHO/UNU report [37]. Nevertheless, this limitation does not diminish our estimates of the decrement in HM hr/week and suggests a modest underestimation of HMEE that is supportive of our overall interpretation of decreased PA and HMEE. Implications for Public Health Policy The estimated reductions in HM (>12 hr/week) and HMEE (>7.7 Mj/week; 1850 kcal/week) were not compensated by the observed increases in LTPA (<1.3 hr/week; 1.9 Mj/week; 460 kcal/week); nor can the decrements be adequately compensated by meeting the 2008 federal PA recommendations of 2.5 hr/week of moderate intensity PA (MPA) (~2.3 Mj/week; ~560 kcal/week) [71] or the Institute of Medicine\u201ds recommendation for the maintenance of a healthy weight of 60 minutes/day of MPA (~6.6 Mj/week; 1575 kcal/week) [72]. Future PA recommendations may need to be increased to overcome the total decrement in the various domains of PA (e.g., transport [59], occupational [30]) that some sub-groups (e.g., stay-at-home moms) have experienced over the past half century. Conclusion Physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world [2], [73], [74] and yet is all too often under-emphasized in clinical, educational and public health settings [75], [76], [77]. While the attraction of simple causation in the etiology of obesity is powerful (e.g., economic forces cause obesity), the development of effective strategies and tactics to ameliorate the effects of NCDs and obesity necessitates a broad understanding of the complexities of human behavior and energy metabolism, inclusive of EI, EE and PA. \n \n Acknowledgments Disclaimer: Analyses and the inferences in this research are those drawn by the authors, and may not reflect the views of the creators or funders of AHTUS or the collectors of the original surveys harmonized in this dataset. ||||| David Neevel (YouTube) \n \n A cookie-favoring physicist has created what appears to be the world's first Oreo separator. \n \n David Neevel, an artist and inventor based in Portland, Ore., was commissioned by the popular cookie brand to produce the machine as part of its \"Cookies vs. Creme\" campaign. \n \n \"My Oreo machine is based entirely on my dislike for creme and my preference for cookie,\" Neevel said in a short video that could easily be mistaken for a \"Portlandia\" sketch. \n \n The OSM, as Neevel calls it, was constructed of scrap aluminum, wood, a hatchet and floss in a Portland garage. \n \n After the hatchet blade is lowered to split the Oreo, a pair of mechanical arms are dispatched to collect the cookie halves, which are transferred to a router table where the creme is removed. \n \n The electric-powered contraption took about two weeks to build. \"It was a big time commitment,\" Neevel said. \"I had to work some long hours\u2014I didn't see my girlfriend or my dog for hours at a time.\" \n \n \"Outstanding.

The hearing also heard the same evidence as the first inquest. \n \n Alcohol toxicity \n \n She specifically said she did not want to die Dr Christina Romete, Amy Winehouse's GP \n \n The hearing was told the star was more than five times the legal drink-drive limit when she died, having 416mg of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood in her system - the legal driving limit is 80mg. \n \n Dr Radcliffe said the star died from \"alcohol toxicity\", adding it was \"a level of alcohol commonly associated with fatality\". \n \n She said Winehouse \"voluntarily consumed alcohol\" and added \"two empty vodka bottles were on the floor\" beside her bed when her body was discovered. \n \n In a written statement, Winehouse's GP, Dr Christina Romete, said she saw her patient the night before her death. \"She specifically said she did not want to die,\" said Dr Romete. \n \n Eating disorder \n \n The doctor added: \"She was genuinely unwilling to follow the advice of doctors, being someone who wanted to do things her own way.\" \n \n The doctor's statement also revealed Winehouse struggled with an eating disorder, where she made herself sick. \n \n In a written statement, Winehouse's live-in security guard Andrew Morris spoke about the moment he realised she was dead. \n \n \"I was upset and shaken,\" he said. \"She's like a sister to me.\" \n \n Det Insp Les Newman confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances over the death. \n \n The inquest was told the post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as alcohol toxicity and the singer probably suffered a respiratory arrest. \n \n Disciplinary proceedings \n \n The move to hold another inquest came after an investigation found that Suzanne Greenaway, who oversaw the first inquest, did not have the correct qualifications for the role. \n \n She was appointed in July 2009 by her husband, Andrew Reid after she had worked as a solicitor and barrister in Australia. \n \n But she stepped down in November 2011 when it emerged that she did not have the requisite five years' experience in the Law Society. \n \n Dr Reid resigned from his position last month after the Office for Judicial Complaints launched disciplinary proceedings against him. \n \n Other inquests conducted by Ms Greenaway have also been reheard. ||||| Troubled singer Amy Winehouse accidentally drank herself to death at her north London home, a coroner has confirmed. \n \n Dr Shirley Radcliffe recorded a verdict of death by misadventure at St Pancras Coroners Court. \n \n The inquest, which originally concluded in October 2011, had to be re-opened after it emerged the first coroner had not been properly qualified. \n \n But in a hearing that lasted just 40 minutes, Dr Radcliffe verdict matched that of the original inquest. \n \n The singer drank herself to death by accident at the age of 27 \n \n She said Winehouse had \"at no time been considered depressed or suicidal\" and on the day of her death had been described as \"her usual bubbly self\". \n \n The court heard there had been no suspicious circumstances and no evidence of illicit drugs in the 27-year-old's system - but the level of alcohol in her blood had been over five times the drink-drive limit. \n \n Two empty vodka bottles were found on the floor of her bedroom. \n \n The coroner concluded: \"I'm satisfied on the balance of probability that Amy voluntarily consumed a large amount of alcohol in a deliberate act that took an unexpected turn and led to the death of a talented young woman at such an early age.\" \n \n None of Winehouse's family were present, having made it clear they were happy with the first inquest which they said had brought them \"some relief to have finally found out what had happened to Amy\". \n \n But that verdict, delivered by deputy assistant coroner Suzanne Greenaway, could not stand after it was found she had been wrongfully appointed by the area's senior coroner, who was also her husband. \n \n Dr Andrew Reid has now resigned from his post after disciplinary proceedings were launched against him. \n \n His wife, who did not have the necessary experience, has also stepped down.",

The woman lived in an apartment on the third floor of the landmark building, police officer Ethell Wilson said. The Tribune also reported that the woman left a note warning authorities of the dangerous situation. Sodium azide, a colorless salt, is the gas-forming component in many car airbag systems. When mixed with water it is acutely toxic. \n \n Despite this report, it is unclear, however, how, or if, the woman was affiliated with the Berkeley City Club.

The joint command was taking steps to make the building safe. \n \n \u201cThe known quantity of what appeared to be a hazardous material has been removed,\u201d Okies said. He confirmed the suicide took place inside the Berkeley City Club, but said he could not be more specific. \n \n The death investigation was ongoing at 6:30 p.m. and the 2300 block of Durant was still closed, due mainly, said Okies, to the large quantity of vehicles and equipment situated there. \n \n Berkeley Fire also responded initially to the incident, according to Deputy Fire Chief Avery Webb.

    "document": "Details Published on November 20, 2013 Written by Amanda H. Miller Hits: 1763 \n \n Facing fixed-mount solar panels west instead of south could produce more electricity during peak demand according to a new study from Pecan Street Research, which debunks the conventional wisdom that solar panels should always face south when installed on homes in the northern hemisphere. \n \n The research firm, based at the University of Texas's Austin campus, concentrates on testing and developing new technology and business models in advanced energy management systems. The company tested 50 Austin homes with solar panels, some with south-facing installations. Pecan Street used a financial incentive to convince others to install west-facing solar panels for the sake of the study, which is the first of its kind. \n \n While advanced modeling and research used by installers suggest homeowners could lose up to 30 percent of their energy production by facing solar panels west instead of south, the Pecan Street study found otherwise. \n \n Austin homes with west-facing solar panels produced 2 percent more electricity during the course of a normal day than homeowners with south-facing panels. Beyond that, they produced 49 percent more electricity during peak demand hours of 3 to 7pm. Homeowners with south-facing solar panels reduced their peak energy usage by 54 percent, while those with west-facing panels cut their power draws by 65 percent. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no other residential demand response tool generating 60 percent reductions,\u201d Brewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street, told Green Tech Media. \u201cThose are pretty extraordinary peak reductions.\u201d \n \n This research has the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market. While homeowners with east-west roof pitches have historically thought they would not be good candidates for solar, it turns out their west-facing roof could be an even better spot for solar than their neighbor\u2019s south-facing roof. It essentially opens the solar market up to every homeowner who doesn\u2019t have significant shading issues. \n \n It also means homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels - even if they do have a south-facing roof -especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours. \n \n It's important to note, however, that the Austin study was conducted during the summer months. It\u2019s hard to predict what the overall outcome of the same study would be if winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes, were included. \n \n Comments: ||||| Conventional wisdom says that if you put solar panels on your roof in the Northern Hemisphere, you should point them within 30 degrees of true south to generate the most energy in the course of a year. But a new study by Pecan Street Research Institute, an Austin, Texas-based research and development organization, suggests that most people may do better at covering their own electrical use and reducing stress on utility grids during summertime peak demand periods if they aim the panels westward instead. (See related quiz: What You Don\u2019t Know About Solar Power.\u201d) \n \n Though the study has not been released publicly, Pecan Street provided a copy to National Geographic News. It analyzed 50 homes in the Austin area, looking not just at the amount of electricity generated by the panels, but at the impact on homeowners\u2019 electricity use and the utility grid during periods of summer peak electrical demand, which generally occur between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. (See related post: \u201cSolar Researchers Dig Deeper Into Snow Issue.\u201d) \n \n The study found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65 percent. Homes with the conventional true-south orientation, in comparison, achieved a 54 percent reduction. \n \n Pecan Street chief executive and study co-author Brewster McCracken explained that west-oriented panels may be more effective for many homeowners because of their lifestyles. West-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which also happens to be the time that most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer, he said. So homeowners with panels facing in that direction are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time that their own usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. \n \n Additionally, McCracken said, using a west orientation for panels means that less electricity will go unused by the homeowners who generated it, and end up as surplus electricity being put back into the grid. That makes things easier for utility companies. \u201cThey\u2019re not structured to handle high levels of electricity being sent back to the grid,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have to do that, it becomes a challenge to maintain electric reliability in an area.\u201d (See related story: \u201cNew \u2018Flexible\u2019 Power Plants Sway to Keep Up With Renewables.\u201d) \n \n While solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb, and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south, McCracken said. He\u2019s hoping that the study will prompt them to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. \n \n The Pecan Street study isn\u2019t the first to show that west-facing panels may be more effective. A California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing systems were \u201csignificantly better\u201d at offsetting peak load that south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields. \n \n Solar Energy Industries Association spokesperson Samantha Page declined comment on the study. A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that the utility continues to recommend a conventional south orientation for solar panels. \n \n David Mooney, laboratory program manager for solar R&D portfolio at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, said that Pecan Street\u2019s findings weren\u2019t a surprise, but hoped that the more precise quantification would motivate both consumers and utilities to fine-tune their use of solar installations. \n \n Mooney said that the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation would vary, depending upon the region, and that no single prescription necessarily fits all places. \u201cIn Colorado, for example, we tend to have clouds rolling in off the mountains in the west in the summer, so west-facing arrays would produce the least electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would want to have a southern or eastern orientation here to get the most electricity, and that wouldn\u2019t necessarily align with the utility company\u2019s peak demand.\u201d \n \n Mooney also noted that the structure of the incentives provided by utility companies figures into how consumers chose to orient their panels. His own utility provider in Colorado, for example, offers incentives that reward optimum output over the year, rather than the amount of electricity generated during periods of peak demand. \u201cI get no benefit from shaving their peak demand, so there\u2019s no motivation to do it,\u201d he said. \n \n Vote and comment: \u201cWhat Energy Solution Should We Develop Next?\u201c) ||||| Conventional wisdom in the northern hemisphere is to face solar panels south so they get the most light all day. Architects and panel installers implement this approach all the time, especially on homes. But a new study indicates that panels facing west may actually get more juice from the sun, and at more convenient times. \n \n Researchers at the Pecan Street Research Institute did a study of homes with solar panels in Austin, Texas and found that when homeowners faced solar panels west they were able to generate 2% more electricity in a day. And they also generated more electricity in the afternoon, when power grids experience peak demand. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Though a 2% increase in electricity generation isn't enormous, it would certainly add up over the life of solar panels. And the rise in afternoon performance, reducing grid dependance during peak hours by 65% as opposed to 54% for south-facing panels, could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes. \n \n It's only one study so nothing is definitive yet, but if nothing else the research raises a good point about testing solar panel performance in practice instead of just assuming that angling south is always the way to go.

Those in support of change pointed to aggressive growth expectations on the heels of tax reform and deregulation. On the other side, economists like Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman believed expecting anything approaching 3-3.5% GDP was little more than economic arrogance. \n \n Investors have cast their votes driving up U.S. stocks more than 20% in 2017. Today, as we approach the end of the year it\u2019s natural for those same investors to turn their attention to 2018 and beyond. It\u2019s a ritual as old as markets but fraught with risk. After a 20% rise in stocks Wall Street has become unquestionably bullish with Oppenheimer\u2019s John Stolzfus already announcing an S&P 500 target of 3000 for next year. Even Goldman which spent much of the year focused on the downside is looking for a modest rise on the heels of tax reform. \n \n One thing about crystal balls. When you look at the beginning of the year they seem decidedly clear with all but a GPS moving map showing us the path down the Yellow Brick Road. Unfortunately, just when you need it most it starts to malfunction failing to alert you when the Wicked Witch of the East zooms in for the kill. \n \n The danger in these predictions is that more often than not we extrapolate recent history into the future. If the market was up in the last year, than by all means it should continue. If we\u2019ve been in a prolonged downturn than of course expect markets to continue to struggle. \n \n The most dangerous predictions of all are those that go out 3-4 even 5 years. Anyone making long term predictions about how something as complex as the world economy is going to react 5 years from now, is likely on par with my prediction the New York Jets will re-sign Joe Namath and win the Super Bowl in 2020. \n \n The above doesn\u2019t make predictions a useless exercise. It\u2019s ok to plan ahead but explore both sides of the issue knowing that your opponent\u2019s crystal ball may be more accurate than your own. \n \n I currently fall into that same camp as many extrapolating 2017 a very good year into the next. PMI data around the world points to geosynchronous growth which doesn\u2019t happen all that often. Strength in overseas markets means our customers are doing well and that\u2019s great news for U.S. multinationals. \n \n Markets are driven by all sorts of factors but in the long run they follow earnings. There are any number of items in this tax bill I don\u2019t agree with but if the corporate rate comes in anywhere close to 20%, then 15% earnings growth is doable. $150 in S&P earnings isn\u2019t out of the question. \n \n Add the fact that these very same large caps will get access to a couple trillion dollars parked off shore and the picture looks pretty bright. The question is; what will they do with it? I\u2019ve been critical of CEOs for focusing too much attention on buybacks. I believe, we\u2019re at the beginning of a capex cycle as CEOs understand that they have to start growing the top line if they want to remain competitive. \n \n Buybacks are slowing \n \n \n \n \n \n Buybacks have already started slowing, peaking in early 2016. You\u2019ve heard me say this in any number of interviews; \u201cthe next leg of the bull market isn\u2019t going to come on the heels of financial engineering.\u201d There are too many examples of buyback casualties that bought back their own stock at higher prices effectively destroying capital. \n \n Story Continues ||||| We polled the experts, consulted the analysts, and read the white papers.

    "document": "This was the year everyone went gaga for Lady Gaga. \n \n The shape-shifting pop star takes home Billboard's top artist of the year honors, just a year after she earned top new artist applause. The last time an act made a move from \"new\" to \"top\" faster was in 2006, when Chris Brown snared both titles concurrently. Before that, the last woman to graduate nearly as fast was Whitney Houston, who was our top new artist of 1985 and then became the top artist the following year. \n \n See all of Billboard's 2010 Year-End Charts \n \n Billboard's year-end music recaps are based on chart performance during the chart year that began with last year's Dec. 5 issue and ended with the Nov. 27, 2010, issue. The year-end Top Artists list ranks the best-performing acts of the year derived from activity on two charts: the Billboard 200 albums tally and the Billboard Hot 100 singles list. \n \n Since we created the top overall artist category with our year-end recaps in 1981, only seven women have taken home the trophy, including Gaga. Taylor Swift nabbed it in 2009, preceded by LeAnn Rimes (1997), Alanis Morissette (1996), Mariah Carey (1991), Whitney Houston (1986) and Madonna (1985). \n \n Gaga takes the artist of the year honor thanks in part to the chart performance of her first two albums, \"The Fame\" and \"The Fame Monster\" (both on Streamline/KonLive/Cherrytree/Interscope), which rank at Nos. 4 and 13, respectively, on the year-end Top Billboard 200 Albums tally. Four singles from those albums appear on the Hot 100 Songs roundup, led by \"Bad Romance\" at No. 8. \n \n Swift is 2010's No. 2 artist of the year -- not too shabby for the Big Machine singer who was our top artist last year. With her one-two punch in 2009 and 2010, it marks the first time an act has been one of the top two artists in successive years since Destiny's Child was the top artist in 2000 and 2001. Narrowing the accolade among only soloists, Garth Brooks was the last to do so, when he was the No. 1 act in 1992 and 1993. The last woman? Mariah Carey, who was No. 1 in 1991 and No. 2 in 1992. \n \n Over on our year-end Billboard 200 albums tally, four of the top 10 slots are occupied by just two artists: Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber. Swift's \"Fearless\" (2009) is at No. 7 while the just-released \"Speak Now\" is at No. 9. The Bieb's \"My World 2.0\" is No. 5 while his 2009 \"My World\" (EP) is at No. 8. For each, it marks the first time on act has held down two of the top 10 year-end Billboard 200 albums since 1992. That was when Brooks finished the year with \"Ropin' the Wind\" at No. 1 and \"No Fences\" at No. 6. \n \n \"Speak Now\" charted for only three weeks during the 2010 chart year, making its No. 9 placing a stunning achievement. Ranking on the year-end tally is determined by a title's weekly charting sales. So, \"Speak Now\" made up for its short chart life in the chart year with massive sales: It moved 1.6 million units in those three weeks, according to Nielsen SoundScan. \n \n Elsewhere, neither Gaga nor Swift charted on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums tally, marking the first time neither of the top two artists of the year have done so since 1997, when Rimes and Spice Girls came in at Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, on that chart. \n \n So, last year Gaga was our new artist and then became the top artist this year. Could Ke$ha, who snags the throne on 2010's Top New Artists list, win the big prize in 2011? This year the Kemosabe/RCA singer celebrates not just her new artist win but also her crowning of the Hot 100 Songs roundup, where her debut charting single \"TiK ToK\" is tops. The track spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Hot 100 list. \n \n The last time an act's first charting single became the top song of the year was only two years ago, when Flo Rida reigned with \"Low.\" However, since Billboard began producing year-end recaps in 1946, no woman -- until Ke$ha -- had managed the feat. \n \n Two steps behind Ke$ha on the new artist tally is Susan Boyle, who earns her ranking mostly on the strength of her two hit albums, \"I Dreamed a Dream\" and \"The Gift.\" The former spent six weeks atop the Billboard 200 and finishes 2010 as the No. 1 Top Billboard 200 album. \n \n At No. 2 on the year-end Billboard 200 albums list is Eminem's \"Recovery.\" All of the rapper's albums -- save for his debut, \"The Slim Shady LP\" -- have finished among the year-end top 10 Billboard 200 albums. He's ranked in the top two twice before: in 2005 with \"Encore\" (No. 2) and in 2002 with \"The Eminem Show\" (No. 1). \n \n Eminem also ends 2010 as the No. 3 artist of the year, and with Gaga and Swift at Nos. 1 and 2, he's our top male artist. \n \n Country trio Lady Antebellum is the highest-ranking group on the top artist recap, coming in at No. 4. It's the first time a country act is the biggest group of the year. \n \n Since Billboard began compiling year-end combined pop artist categories in 1977 (for males, females and duo/groups, respectively) no country act had ever finished the year as the top overall duo/group. \n \n Lady A also takes home the No. 2 honor on the Hot 100 Songs recap with its Capitol Nashville single \"Need You Now,\" which spent two weeks at No. 2 on the weekly tally, but lingered for 42 weeks within the top 40 during the eligibility period. A country single last reached such heights on the year-end Hot 100 tally in 2000, when Faith Hill's \"Breathe\" was the top Hot 100 song. ||||| Billboard Honors Lady Gaga and Ke$ha With Year's Top Awards \n \n Email This Gaga ooh la la is right! \n \n \n \n The meat-wearing songstress has been honored with Billboard's Artist of the Year award for 2010, a prize nabbed by paparazzi darling \n \n \n \n Despite being ousted from the top spot by Gaga, the 'Speak Now' singer hasn't been left out of the 2010 lineup completely.

Swift comes in at number two this year, and is the only solo artist to spend two successive years in the top two spots since Garth Brooks in the early 1990s. \n \n Of course, with Gaga vacating the Top New Artist throne, there's room for a new entrant. Cue 'Cannibal' Ke$ha, whose Jack Daniels-doused oral hygiene and songwriting styles have won the hearts of a nation.Boosting her into the honor is her 2010 hit 'Tik Tok,' which spent nine weeks atop the Hot 100 list. Impressively, 'Tik Tok' was Ke$ha's first single to make it on to Billboard's charts.The recipients of Billboard's highest group honor are country crooners Lady Antebellum, whose hit 'Need You Now' spent a whopping 42 weeks of the eligibility period on the Billboard top 40.",

    "document": "The government plans to order emergency inspections today of 80 older Boeing 737s similar to the Southwest Airlines jet that suffered a 5-foot tear in its roof on Friday in a search for possibly dangerous cracks. \n \n The Federal Aviation Administration order will cover some 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s, models of the popular jet built in the 1980s and 1990s. The jets covered under the order include those built with a specific manufacturing process and with more than 30,000 flights, the agency said Monday. \n \n There are about 175 of the aircraft worldwide, 80 of which are registered in the USA, the FAA said. Southwest operates 78 of the jets and Alaska Airlines has two. Boeing said it is also working on a bulletin to airlines suggesting inspections. \n \n Although the number of jets affected by the order is small, some aviation safety experts said the incident is shining a new light onto aging aircraft safety. \n \n Despite more than two decades of efforts to better understand and detect cracks, the tear on the Southwest jet occurred in an area that was not considered high risk. \n \n \"This could change the conversation regarding the risk of aging aircraft,\" said Bill Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation. The FAA last year toughened the standards for aging aircraft, but the latest discovery could lead to even broader requirements for costly inspections, Voss said. \n \n \"Last Friday's incident was very serious and could result in additional action depending on the outcome of the investigation,\" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. \n \n Southwest Flight 812 lost cabin pressure at 34,000 feet and had to make an emergency descent into thicker air after leaving Phoenix for Sacramento. A flight attendant was injured, but none of the 118 passengers was hurt. \n \n National Transportation Safety Board investigators found additional cracks on the same seam in the skin where it ripped open, NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said. Southwest also found similar cracks on three additional 737-300s and grounded the jets, the airline said. \n \n The jet involved in the accident appeared to have suffered corrosion from moisture that got into the joint where two thin bands of aluminum skin were joined, Sumwalt said. Rivet holes had also become slightly enlarged, he said. \n \n \"It indicates that something is going on in that joint that should not be going on,\" Sumwalt said. \n \n The FAA ordered the inspections be done with an electro-magnetic process that detects cracks invisible to the naked eye. \n \n As of Monday afternoon, Southwest had returned all but 14 of its 737-300s to service. ||||| The federal government on Tuesday will order emergency inspections on 175 Boeing 737 airliners, and is rethinking its approach to plane inspections after a Southwest Airlines jet tore open in mid-flight Friday night, ABC News has learned. \n \n Inspections will initially focus on 175 planes, used by airlines around the world, that make frequent takeoffs and landings. Eighty of the planes are in service in the United States, most of them for Southwest Airlines. \n \n The government is particularly concerned about older 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500 jets that have taken off and landed more than 30,000 times. Jets that have accumulated many flight cycles are apparently more likely to develop the sort of fatigue cracks that may have caused the tear in the skin of the Southwest 737-300 last week. \n \n As the nation's planes age, more jets could cause concern and require inspection for such fatigue cracks. \n \n Inspectors use something called eddy current technology, passing an electric current through an aircraft's skin to look for small cracks. If any warning signs are detected, more sophisticated ultrasound and X-ray tools are then used for a closer examination. In some areas, a plane's skin can be as thin as a nickel. \n \n Fatigue Cracks Found in Three Other Southwest Jets \n \n Southwest said today that it has inspected some 90 percent of its 737-300s, which were removed from service after the weekend. So far, inspections have uncovered fatigue cracks in three planes, the airline said. 64 other planes have been inspected and returned to service, with a dozen other planes still requiring inspection. The airline believes its inspection process complies with the government's order. \n \n Due to the voluntary grounding, Southwest has had to cancel at least 600 flights since Friday's emergency landing. \n \n Southwest flight 812, enroute from Phoenix to Sacramento, Calif., was diverted to a military base at Yuma, Ariz., after a section of the plane's fuselage ripped open, depressurizing the plane and exposing the sky to passengers. \n \n Last night, another Southwest flight was diverted. The flight, headed from Oakland, Calif., to San Diego, Calif. made an emergency landing because of a burning electrical smell. \n \n Meanwhile, the five-foot section of the plane's fuselage that opened up Friday on flight 812 is headed back to Washington, D.C., for detailed microscopic analysis. \n \n The jet came apart at a seam, where two pieces of metal are riveted together, which is an especially dangerous location because the plane can essentially unzip, experts said. \n \n \"We have clear evidence that the skin separated at the lower rivet line,\" Robert Sumwalt, a NTSB Board member, said. \n \n The 15-year-old damaged aircraft had been through more than 39,000 takeoffs and landings -- each of which puts stress on an aircraft's skin. \n \n \"When airplanes take off and land, aircraft are pressurized. The internal cabin is expanded and contracts just a little bit,\" said Steve Ganyard, a former military pilot. \"You're exercising the skin of that aircraft.\" \n \n Neither the Federal Aviation Administration nor Boeing requires an intensive inspection to check for fatigue cracks on the section of passenger jet that tore open Friday, ABC News has learned. \n \n After the incident Friday, the revelation calls into question the inspection program for aging U.S. aircraft. \n \n The Southwest jet had what is known as a D-check in March 2010, the most comprehensive check for an airplane. \n \n Based on modeling and previous flight experience of Boeing 737-300s, it was believed that the cracks could not develop in this area of the plane. \n \n Those cracks, which can develop after repeated takeoffs and landings, may well have been what caused the fuselage to fail, according to some experts. \n \n \"Now we may have to look at airplanes in places we never thought we would have to check before,\" said Ganyard, an ABC News consultant. \n \n Other fuselage cracks were found and repaired on this particular aircraft during heavy maintenance in March 2010, according to The Associated Press. \n \n Upon review of the records of the repair, ABC News discovered at least a dozen fuselage crack repairs. \n \n Southwest now says that what was seen with Flight 812 was a new and unknown issue. \n \n \"Boeing has since identified an inspection program for this section of the aircraft,\" Southwest said in a statement. \"Based on this incident and the additional findings, we expect further action from Boeing and the FAA for operators of the 737-300 fleet worldwide.\" \n \n Southwest Flight 812 Drops 20,000 Feet in Four and a Half Minutes \n \n On Friday's harrowing flight, the first 20 minutes all appeared normal as the plan climbed to 36,000 feet. Flight attendants had just taken drink orders when the plane's 118 passengers reported hearing loud pops. Then, with the plane at approximately 34,000 feet, the roof opened up near the luggage compartment and oxygen masks dropped in front of passengers. At least one flight attendant passed out. \n \n Passenger Wade Allemand said he almost passed out. \n \n \"Your ears instantly start to hurt really bad. You feel like you're going to black out,\" he said. \n \n The crew turned the jet sharply to the right, pushed the nose down, losing more than 20,000 feet in just four and a half minutes. \n \n Passengers had a short amount of time to get their oxygen masks on. \n \n \"It depends on what the decompression is. Sometimes it's minutes, sometimes it's two to three seconds,\" Lauren Jarmoszko, a flight safety instructor, said. \n \n Loss of oxygen impacts cognition, memory and reaction time. It can also lead to brain damage. \n \n In a rapid decompression, like the Southwest flight, the oxygen mask drops quickly. There are also instances of slow decompression which is usually caused by a small leak in a window or door seal. Passengers and crew may not even notice the first effects: fatigue, mental confusion, and dulled reflexes. \n \n The captain on Flight 812 had 19 years experience with Southwest, while his first officer had seven years of experience, and he received assistance as typical when declaring a emergency, according to the NTSB. \n \n Some terrified passengers clearly thought it was the end. One woman whose husband was on the plane received a text from him -- \"Plane going down. Love you.\" \n \n However, the plane was able to land at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 4:07 p.m. Friday, said Ian Gregor of the Federal Aviation Administration. \n \n Passengers applauded the pilots upon landing, called loved ones and waited for a new Southwest jet to pick them up and take them on their way. \n \n ABC's Jessica Hopper contributed to this report. \n \n Click here to return to the \"World News\" page.",

    "document": "The US rock band Bloodhound Gang has been banned from performing in Russia, beaten up by Cossacks, and could find itself facing criminal charges after one of the group jokingly desecrated a Russian flag during a concert in Ukraine. \n \n The incident suggests that as Russia-US relations plummet to a post-cold war low, unscripted moments like this, as well as the ongoing Edward Snowden saga, are increasingly shaping public perceptions on both sides. And the results can be unpredictable. \n \n The scandal erupted after a video surfaced on YouTube of the band's bassist, Jared Hasselhoff, shouting \"don't tell Putin\" before shoving a Russian flag into his pants during a July 31 concert in Odessa, Ukraine. \n \n He later apologized, suggesting the stunt was just part of his usual onstage schtick. Seconds after the act occurred, the band's leader, Jimmy Pop, told the audience that he \"disagrees\" with what Mr. Hasselhoff had just done because \"unfortunately, Russia is better than America.\" \n \n None of those contradictory signals appear to have made it through to the Russian media or blogosphere, where a storm of outrage erupted over the footage of the flag being grossly disrespected. \n \n Bloodhound Gang was scheduled to perform Friday at the Kubana Festival, an annual event featuring about 50 international rock bands, held in Anapa, in the Kuban region of southern Russia. But as they arrived, local authorities were receiving instructions from Moscow to bar their performance. \n \n \"I've had a conversation with the Krasnodar region authorities. Bloodhound Gang is packing their suitcases,\" Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky tweeted Friday. \n \n \"These idiots will not perform in Kuban,\" he said. \n \n As Bloodhound Gang headed for Anapa airport to leave the next day, their minivan was reportedly pelted with eggs and rotten tomatoes by demonstrators who wielded signs with slogans like \"Go home, Pigs\" and \"Get out of Russia.\" Inside the airport they were attacked by a gang of self-described Cossacks who later posted a YouTube video showing them apparently trying to strangle Hasselhoff with an American flag \u2013 which they later placed on the floor and stomped on. \n \n The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, issued a hand-wringing tweet Sunday, saying \"I find the actions of Bloodhound Gang disgusting. I also condemn the act of violence against them.\" \n \n But on Monday the Kremlin's Investigative Committee, the country's highest law enforcement body, stepped in to announce that it was launching a criminal investigation into the affair. \n \n \"Given the cynicism of the crime, expressing blatant disrespect to the Russian state [the Investigative Committee] is organizing a procedural probe into this matter,\" the statement said. It added that it might appeal to US legal authorities for assistance in the investigation. \n \n Some Russian lawmakers have suggested that Hasselhoff's act was not simply a bit of spontaneous buffoonery, but might have been a \"planned provocation\" by some anti-Russian forces. \n \n \"The organizers of such arrivals should bear full responsibility for what happened and enraged Russian citizens,\" the State Duma's vice speaker Sergei Neverov told journalists Sunday. \n \n \"There are questions to those who invited them to Russia, to those who organized their concerts, offered venues, paid for their activities. Whose orders did the group fulfill? Those who paid them money and they did what they did. Like Madonna did in her time\u2026 These are all parts of one chain,\u201d Mr. Neverov is quoted as saying. \n \n Madonna infuriated Russian conservatives by publicly supporting the imprisoned Russian performance art group Pussy Riot during a visit to Moscow a year ago. She and Lady Gaga have become regular objects for abuse by right-wing Russian bloggers because of their outspoken support for gay rights, amid a growing crackdown on LGBT expression in Russia. \n \n So it's no surprise that over the weekend Russian authorities also announced that they are investigating Madonna and Lady Gaga for allegedly violating the terms of their visas when each visited Russia to hold performances last year. \n \n Amid the outpouring of righteous fury over Hasselhoff's act of flag-desecration, it's hard to find any Russian with an alternative opinion. \n \n But Natalia Zimyanina, music critic for the opposition weekly Novaya Gazeta, says she worries that public anger will be channeled by the powerful Russian Orthodox Church and other conservative forces to install a new \"iron curtain\" to once again shut Russia off from Western cultural influences. \n \n Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

And it's clear that this overgrown child [Hasselhoff] has caused a lot of damage with his stupid act,\" says Ms. Zimyanina. \n \n \"But I worry that our authorities haven't a clue about the nature of punk art. Provocations are an integral part of it, and as we saw in the Pussy Riot case, it has a way of exposing raw nerves in our society,\" Zimyanina says. \"That can be painful, but it's the reaction of the authorities that we should be most worried about.... I fear this incident will become a pretext to close the Kubana Festival itself. It's a wonderful festival, we don't have any others like it in Russia anymore.

Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner has acknowledged he communicated... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Online communications between disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl are being investigated by law enforcement agencies in New York and North Carolina, officials said Thursday. \n \n The office of Jill Westmoreland Rose, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte, has \"begun investigative efforts,\" a spokeswoman said. An FBI task force in New York designed to combat the sexual exploitation of children also is investigating, according to a law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing case and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n \n The investigations were launched after an online outlet, DailyMail.com, on Wednesday published an interview with the girl in which she describes online and text exchanges with Weiner that went on for several months this year. The girl said that during a Skype chat Weiner asked her to undress and touch herself. \n \n Weiner, a Democrat who resigned from Congress in 2011 amid a sexting scandal, didn't return text or email messages seeking comment on Thursday. \n \n But in a statement he gave to The Associated Press on Wednesday he said he had \"likely been the subject of a hoax,\" and he provided an email written by the girl in which she recants her story. He also apologized, noting he had \"repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent.\" \n \n The girl, whose identity the Daily Mail didn't reveal, said she told her father and a teacher about the relationship. She said she wrote the email because Weiner asked her to but never sent it. \n \n A spokeswoman for the FBI and a spokesman for federal prosecutors in Manhattan declined to comment. \n \n Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and has a young son with her. He resigned from Congress after it was revealed he had been exchanging sexually explicit messages with multiple women. \n \n He then unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2013 and was leading several polls until it was revealed he had continued his questionable behavior. Abedin left him this month after revelations he had sent more sexually charged messages to another woman. ||||| Anthony Weiner carried on a months-long online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl during which she claims he asked her to dress up in 'school-girl' outfits for him on a video messaging application and pressed her to engage in 'rape fantasies', DailyMail.com can exclusively report. \n \n The girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January while she was a high school sophomore and before Weiner's wife, Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin, announced she was ending their marriage. \n \n Weiner was aware that the girl was underage, according to DailyMail.com interviews with the girl and her father, as well as a cache of online messages. \n \n SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE TEEN ON TAPE \n \n Anthony Weiner carried on a months-long sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl online, and even sent her photos of himself, including one of him in a pool \n \n The high school girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January \n \n In one message, he tells the girl he was 'hard' after thinking of her that morning \n \n In another message, both Weiner and the girl tell each other they feel like they can tell each other anything \n \n The pair even joke about nicknames for each other, and Weiners old name of 'Carlos Danger.' But he says he wants her call her 'mine' \n \n In one Confide message - which deletes the sender's name after the first message is open, Weiner tells the girl 'I would bust that tight p***y. 'The app is designed for confidentiality, and automatically deletes messages and images after the first time they are read or viewed. However, the girl took photos of a few of the messages and images from last February and March, which she shared with the Dailymail.com. \n \n He goes on to say that he would 'bust' it 'so hard and so often that you would be limp for a week' \n \n 'I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,' Weiner told DailyMail.com \n \n In the online messages, Weiner, 51, sent bare-chested photos of himself to the underage girl, repeatedly called her 'baby' and complimented her body, and told her that he woke up 'hard' after thinking about her, according to copies of the conversations. \n \n In one particularly lewd message, he told the teen: 'I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.' \n \n When confronted with the claims, Weiner did not deny exchanging 'flirtatious' messages with the teen. He declined to comment on the specifics of the allegations on the record, but provided copies of two emails the girl sent him that he contends raised questions about her claims. DailyMail.com publishes them below. \n \n He gave a statement to DailyMail.com in which he says, in part: ' I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.' \n \n WHAT ANTHONY WEINER TOLD DAILYMAIL.COM 'I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. 'I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt. 'While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax, I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. 'I am sorry.' \n \n The revelation comes just weeks after Weiner's wife Huma Abedin announced that they had separated in the wake of another sexting controversy. \n \n In August, the New York Post reported on sexual chats between Weiner and a 40-year-old woman, during which the former congressman sent her provocative shirtless photos of him while his four-year-old son was curled up next to him in bed. \n \n Weiner has faced a number of sexting scandals since 2011, when he was forced to resign from Congress after his online sexual messages with a female college student were revealed. \n \n Another sexting scandal in 2013, involving 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, derailed his bid for New York City mayor. In the course of that scandal, his alias Carlos Danger was disclosed. \n \n The former congressman has faced scrutiny over online chats with minors in the past. \n \n In 2011, he admitted to sending five private Twitter messages to a 17-year-old girl, but said the messages 'were neither explicit nor indecent'. The girl's family told the New York Times that the conversation appeared to be harmless. \n \n DailyMail.com reached out to the 15-year-old girl's family earlier this month after receiving information about her relationship with Weiner. \n \n Although the girl said she did not want to press charges because she believes her relationship with Weiner was consensual, she and her father agreed to sit down for an interview out of concern that Weiner may be sexting with other underage girls. \n \n Weiner and Abedin, still living in the same apartment despite their split, left separately Wednesday morning before the DailyMail.com story was posted online \n \n Huma left to meet Hillary Clinton to fly to Orlando to campaign; Weiner went for a walk \n \n The girl first reached out to Weiner on the evening of January 23, 2016, when she noticed his Twitter page allowed non-followers to contact him through private messages \n \n Weiner sent the teen a bare-chested picture of himself with his hand on his crotch \n \n 'If there's anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward, maybe use my daughter's example to have the courage to come forward,' said her father, whose name is also being withheld to shield the girl's identity. \n \n He explains that he did not contact authorities to report Weiner because his daughter asked him not to. 'I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn't want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on.' \n \n Through interviews and a collection of online messages from applications such as Twitter, Facebook, Kik, and Confide, DailyMail.com has pieced together a timeline of Weiner's relationship with the underage girl. \n \n The girl first reached out to Weiner on the evening of January 23, 2016, when she noticed his Twitter page allowed non-followers to contact him through direct private messages. \n \n She told DailyMail.com she was interested in politics and had heard about his sexting scandals, and was curious to see what he was like. \n \n It was clear from the messages that she was encouraging Weiner to engage with her in a sexual manner. She told DailyMail.com she didn't consider Weiner her boyfriend, but thought the relationship was a 'romantic' one. \n \n She acknowledged during interviews that she had developed an obsession with Weiner, and sought him out on Twitter in January while trying to write a book about him. She said she continued to write the book as their relationship developed. \n \n 'Why did I message you [in January]?' the girl wrote in an email to Weiner last week. 'I was studying you- for a book of course. You were my Hannibal Lecter. \n \n 'I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. I didn't want to appear suspicious.' \n \n She also told Weiner: 'I was obsessed with you.' \n \n Weiner quickly messaged her back, and they struck up a conversation about the large snowstorms that had hit New York and the girl's home state. \n \n The messages started out as small talk, and during their conversation the girl noticed that Weiner had also found her profile on Facebook and sent her a friend request. \n \n 'Where do you go to school?' Weiner asked her. \n \n '[Redacted] High School,' she responded. \n \n Still sexting? Weiner was out and about at the park with his son on Tuesday, but took time out to engage with his phone \n \n Closest aide: Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest aide and vice-chair of her campaign. The two's closeness goes back to when Abedin was a teenage White House intern. \n \n Huma Abedin announced that they had separated in the wake of another sexting controversy. when the former congressmen sent a 40-year-old woman provocative shirtless photos of himself while his toddler son was curled up next to him in bed \n \n Early the next morning, Weiner found the girl on Facebook, sent her a friend request and they began messaging \n \n Weiner sent the teen a picture of himself - with this undershirt rolled up to expose his stomach - and his son. \n \n In one Facebook message, the girl tells Weiner that she's 'very good at keeping a secret' from her parents \n \n 'You are kinda sorta gorgeous,' Weiner told her, before asking around midnight why she wasn't with a boyfriend that night. \n \n 'My dad is overprotective,' said the girl. '[Boyfriends] couldn't be at my house this late.' \n \n The next morning, the girl woke up to find a private message from Weiner on Facebook asking how her night had gone. \n \n 'How did you sleep?' the girl asked him. \n \n 'Not great. Woke up very, uh, eager,' he replied. \n \n He continued to send her flirtatious messages throughout the day, saying he was 'imagining' her when she was in the shower and saying she must get a lot of male attention at the gym. \n \n At one point, Weiner indicated that he knew the conversation could be a problem. \n \n '[I]f anyone would get the wrong impression we should say goodbye now,' said Weiner. However, he did not stop the conversation. \n \n Instead he told the girl they could talk over other chat applications that would not be monitored by her parents. \n \n They began talking on Kik, an instant message app, where Weiner used the screen name 'T Dog.' He sent her photos of himself shirtless, including one photo of him in a hot tub that showed his face. \n \n 'Maybe delete that. Hehe,' he wrote after sending it. \n \n In many of the messages, they discussed Weiner's trips to the gym and love of hockey, and the girl's school activities and her newly acquired learner's permit. But in a number of them, Weiner steered the conversation toward sex. \n \n The pair eventually move to another app, called TK, for conversing, in which they share several photos \n \n After sending a snap from a pool, Weiner tells the girl, 'Maybe delete that. Hehe.' \n \n She then tells Weiner that she doesn't think she would 'look good naked' at the time of messaging \n \n She says she is 'pale' and wants 'to work out more', but Weiner says the flaws 'would no doubt be overlooked' \n \n 'I thought of you this am. Hard,' he wrote in one. \n \n The girl asked if she was the reason. \n \n 'Yes. And the solution,' responded Weiner, adding an emoji image of squirting water. \n \n 'Your body is pretty insane,' he told her at another point. \n \n When the girl told Weiner she'd just gotten home from the gym, he wrote back, 'Hard. Again'. \n \n Several of the messages involve finding times to talk over Skype, a video messaging application, when the girl's parents were asleep or out of the house. \n \n 'Skype may have to be a tomorrow thing,' the girl wrote in one message. 'if I skyped you tonight id have to play music as we talked so that my parents couldn't hear me talking and I'd have to keep the lights off.' \n \n 'No prob baby,' replied Weiner. 'Some other time. When it's easier.' \n \n The girl told DailyMail.com that she and Weiner first started talking on Skype a few days into the relationship. \n \n '[Weiner's] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,' she said. 'So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.' \n \n Afterward, Weiner sent her a message with a heart-eyed emoji, writing 'I caught a glimpse of your body' and indicating he would like to keep talking over Skype. \n \n She claimed the conversations grew more explicit as time went on, with Weiner allegedly asking her to undress and encouraging her to masturbate over video chat. \n \n She said Weiner would not get fully nude, but was usually shirtless and wearing boxers. \n \n 'He would tell me to say his name as I was touching myself,' said the girl. 'He would ask me to take my clothes off. \n \n 'He would just have his shirt off. Sometimes he would grab his lower region, but that was about it,' she added. \n \n Although Weiner did not get undressed on video, she alleges that he did send her nude photos of himself when they would sext over a messaging app. \n \n The app, which is called Confide, is designed for confidentiality, and automatically deletes messages and images after the first time they are read or viewed. \n \n However, the girl took photos of a few of the messages and images from last February and March, which she shared with Dailymail.com. \n \n Shirtless: One of the messages from Kik, where Weiner used the alias T Dog \n \n At one point, the girl asks Weiner if she was the reason he 'woke up so eager', and he said she was also 'the solution' \n \n TEXT OF LETTER WEINER ASKED TEEN TO SEND TO TEACHER The teen wrote this letter but sent it to a fake email address and sent a copy to Weiner. Parts of the letter that might identify her are redacted. The teen told DailyMail.com what she had done. Weiner provided a copy of the letter in his belief it was sent to her teacher. Dr. XXXXX Thank you for being the perfect mentor. I remember the first time we met. I was a 'wise 92 year old stuck in a 13 year old's body' as you described me. I was a rising freshman. Above your door was a sign that said 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.' At that moment I knew that I'd love your class. I walked in and noticed a stack of all of my favorite literary works. Anything from Martin Amis to Albert Camus. We began chatting and I felt like I had known you my whole life. My freshman year [redacted]. I was the first freshman invited and I was thrilled. I started learning [redacted] at the age of 8 years old. I somehow managed [redacted]. You have brought me sooooo many projects. We started on the writing resources center. You and I would travel to the university to bring students to tutor kids at our school that were having a difficult time learning. I had the opportunity to work with some of the sweetest students at our school. I was able to earn 4 extra English course credits. We [redacted]. The student reporting labs have been an educational and a fun hands on experience. Aside from the plethora of knowledge you have graciously provided me with we have also had our deep, meaningful conversations. We share our writings with each other at least once a week. I have enjoyed reading your writings and I have been thankful for the feedback you have given me on mine. I recently shared with you a story about a former congressman. I contacted Anthony Weiner. Our online chats were never inappropriate, he was always very helpful and kind. I wanted to publish my story. He was the best candidate to pin the story to. The story needed a hoax to ride on. Speaking of candidates the election is coming up and his wife is Hillary Clinton's chief of staff. He doesn't have any credibility, I assumed no one would question the allegations. It was unfair to lie to you and my father. It was unfair to spread this false accusation against Anthony Weiner. He has done nothing to deserve this. I am sorry for lying to you, I hope this doesn't affect the bond we have formed over the years. Sincerely [Redcated] \n \n 'When we would Skype, he would tell me that he was very lonely and that it had been a year since he and his wife [Huma] had sex, and that she really didn't pay him any attention,' said the girl. 'We would talk, just chatting for about 30 minutes and it would lead to more sexual things\u2026asking me to undress\u2026he'd comment on my body. He asked me about masturbation, and that kind of thing.' \n \n Sometimes, she claims, Weiner would ask the girl to dress up in plaid skirts and pretend he was her school teacher, she said. \n \n 'He would pretend like he was a teacher and I was a student. And he'd talk about me sitting in the front of his class, and him taking me after school,' she said. \n \n He also shared pornographic videos with her, she added. \n \n The girl said she was not uncomfortable with the sexting, except for when Weiner would try to engage her in 'rape fantasies'. \n \n 'He had some rape fantasies. It would just be him showing up at my house when my dad was out of town,' she said. 'And just start undressing me, being forceful, asking me if I want to be dominated, strange questions.' \n \n She said when she told him she was uncomfortable with this, he quickly agreed to change the subject. \n \n The girl said she started feeling guilty about hiding the relationship, and told her father and a teacher about it in late April. \n \n When Weiner asks if the girl's boyfriend is 'bigger than' him, she says he's a 'skinny nerdy boy' \n \n Weiner sent the girl a picture of his chest with welts he said he got from his heart check up \n \n 'I was scared. I felt bad for talking to [Weiner],' she said. 'I felt a little guilty and I wrote [my dad] a letter telling him.' \n \n But the girl also continued to talk to Weiner. The former congressman pressured her to write two more letters to her father and teacher saying that she lied about the natures of their relationship and the two of them were just friends. \n \n She told Weiner that she would do this, and she sent them to bogus email addresses and sent a copy to Weiner. \n \n 'After I told my teacher about the relationship, [Weiner] wanted me to email my dad and my teacher and tell them that was I said was false,' she said. 'That the conversations were appropriate and were never inappropriate, and he was very helpful.' \n \n Weiner sent DailyMail.com a copy of the letter he believed she sent to her teacher. \n \n The girl said she continued to talk to Weiner until July. \n \n 'After seeing what he did with his son having him in the picture that was released, I think that he's very disgusting and he needs help,' she said. \n \n She said she never viewed him as her 'boyfriend', and that he made this clear by talking to her about his relationships with other women. \n \n 'He talked about women he would meet up with and have sex with, women he would meet at the gym, women he would chat with online,' she said. \n \n 'He would also talk about going to different gyms, and getting different gym memberships, just to go watch 18-year-olds work out that would go to NYU and different schools in New York,' she added. \n \n In August, the New York Post reported on sexual chats between Weiner and a 40-year-old woman, during which the former congressman sent her provocative shirtless photos of him while his four-year-old son was curled up next to him in bed \n \n After the girl tells Weiner that Skype will have to wait because her parents would hear, Weiner says 'No prob baby' \n \n When the girl says that she'll 'work out all of the time' if it 'turns you on', Weiner tells her that her 'body is pretty insane' \n \n However, she said he never mentioned relationships with other underage girls. \n \n 'I actually asked him if he talked to other minors and he said not that he knew of, which is the risk that he kind of takes when he's talking to women on the internet,' she said. \n \n The girl's father said he was horrified when he learned 51-year-old Weiner had been speaking with his daughter over Skype. \n \n 'I couldn't stomach that,' he said. 'That really was the worst part I think, was knowing that inappropriate behavior was available to my daughter by this man.' \n \n He said if he ever met Weiner: 'There wouldn't be any words. There would be no words. I hope I never come in contact with him. I'll be in jail if I come into contact with him.' \n \n While the girl said she does not regret the relationship, her father said the experience has changed her. \n \n 'She's gone through some depression, we've sought counselling and been able to help her work through it,' he said. \n \n 'She's a bright girl, very smart, so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this\u2026it's gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away.' \n \n HOW I FELT: THE LETTER THE 15-YEAR-OLD SENT TO WEINER The teen wrote this letter to Anthony Weiner after her interview with DailyMail.com. Weiner gave it to DailyMail.com to publish, which he says indicates that he 'could have been the subject of a hoax.' The teen told us why she wrote it, saying: ' A few months ago Anthony asked me why I wanted to share my story, and I couldn't really give a good answer so I wanted to explain to him why I was doing it.' 'Don't be ashamed of your story. It will inspire others.' This quote lingered in my mind as my posture was consciously congruent to the hard back of my chair. The air was stale. All eyes were on me. My father's eyes wanted me to lie. At that moment, I had the moral backbone of an eclair. Why was I here? I didn't personally know Anthony Weiner. I felt myself hover over my own body. I was watching myself from above. I was not the same girl that I was when I walked into the hotel. Who was I becoming? Did I just sell my soul to the devil at fifteen? We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war's a spiritual war\u2026 our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires and movie Gods. But we won't. And I'm learning that fact as my lips move. Fear blocked every rational thought. After leaving the hotel, I attempted to justify my every action. It wasn't a difficult task. Anthony continues to make the same mistake and expects a different result each time, he needs to learn his lesson. His wife is already leaving him, what I have done will not tear him apart. He fell in love with something and is letting it kill him. He needs to let go. The list continued to grow. Afterwards, I began to cry. I felt physically ill. I made the decision to not go to school the next day, I felt guilty, guilt is guilt. It doesn't go away. It can't be nullified. It can't even be fully understood, I'm certain- it's roots run too deep into private and long- standing karma. About the only thing that saves my neck when I get to feeling this way is that guilt is an imperfect form of knowledge. Just because it isn't perfect doesn't mean that it can't be used. The hard thing to do is to put it to practical use, before it gets around to paralyzing you. I messaged Anthony. He was trying to play victim... AGAIN! He treats me like I'm an invalid. I never call him out. I am used to his manipulative techniques, I know them very well. I used them long before he tried them on me. I see myself in him. I continue to talk to men online. My parents were not surprised that I contacted him. My dad started rattling off all the other occupations of these other guys.. First it was the teacher.. Yada, yada, yada.. They asked me when I would ever stop this kind of behavior. Why did Anthony and I do these ridiculous things? The only difference was that I didn't have to send out a press release every time that I did something like this. I was losing my soul. If you're losing your soul & you know it, then you still have a soul to lose. 'Apology': Why did I message you? I saw that your direct messages were open. I thought you had fallen off the face of the earth. I assumed you would have deleted your twitter for your wife's sake. I had watched a video of you that same night. I was studying you- for a book of course.You were my Hannibal Lecter. I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. I didn't want to appear suspicious. Why did you message me? I asked you the other day, you didn't return the question. You never do. You don't care enough about other people. 'It had been my job to get into Anthony's brain, but after nine months, I realized he didn't know a thing about me. I approached him at our post-campaign party and asked, 'Do you know I'm a single mom?' I wanted acknowledgment of what my family and I had sacrificed. He didn't know. 'You must feel good about yourself, accomplishing all of this,' he said, missing my point. Then the conversation turned back to him: 'I'm 50 years old, and I need to find a new career.' I smiled, same old Anthony. I said good night, and I haven't seen him since.' ( Provenz, Jessica. 'I Was Anthony Weiner's Longest-Serving Campaign Staffer. This Is What His Mayoral Run Was Really Like.' Daily Intelligencer. N.p., 2016. Web. 08 Sept. 2016. ) It doesn't just stop here, you did this with me on a numerous amount of occasions. You didn't inspect the emails to my teacher and my father. I made two fake emails. I used a ten minute mail, and created a Gmail. You believed me. I talked to you about committing suicide. You didn't try to stop me. I confided in you. I told you about older men taking advantage of me. You called me a liar. I offered proof. You rejected. It's like you don't want to know the answer to things. I believe that you don't go to therapy for that reason. Why do you continue to sext? Is it an addiction? Is it something psychological? Your brother was addicted to drugs. Does addiction run in your family? I can't fully grasp why I do it. I know that it's nice to feel worshipped. Sydney listed you as one of her heroes. You took advantage of her young, naive mind. She was infatuated with you.You should be glad that I am one of the most disensitized teenagers. I don't think I could ever been in love with someone I met over the internet. I did, however, enjoy listening to your podcasts, watching interviews, C-Span, etc. Talking to you helped me write my book about you. I was obsessed with you, the way one obsesses over a character in a book . One day you're going to mess with the wrong teenager, that has the wrong set of parents. Do yourself a favor and try to prevent that. It doesn't matter that you sext. It matters that you sext women you don't know. You tell me that you're in enormous pain (not sure if you're being honest, or playing victim), you read books such as 'So You've been publicly shamed'. It seems as if you have let these scandals consume you. Why do you let these women brand you with scandals. You WEAR your scandal. You were great at trying to change the world around you, why not try to change yourself?? You were a pleasant guy to talk to when you meditated. We fall in love with things, and we let it kill us. You don't have to do that. You're married to sexting and your wife is married to Clinton. If HRC jumped off of a bridge, your wife would be chasing after her, clutching Hillary's purse and jumping with her. Your image is going to affect your son, even Hugh Hefner has children. If you and your wife are truly being sincere about being dedicated to your son's best interest, pay attention to him. Don't photograph him as you sext. Don't give HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON ALL OF YOUR ATTENTION! You're ruining his life before it has even begun. STOP MANIPULATING PEOPLE!!!! You asked me to lie to my teacher, my father, Sydney Leathers, and anyone that asked about this story. It's sick. You only care about yourself. You play victim ALL OF THE TIME. You attempted to make me feel bad about telling my teacher. You pretended that you were my friend. You said 'I trusted you.I skyped you. I told you that my dad was in the hospital. I sent you pictures of my son.' yada, yada, yada. How many women have seen pictures of your kid??? Every woman in your life? STOP MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD FOR YOUR SCANDALS. It's not their fault you make the same mistakes. I am worried about you. You are messaging anyone that flirts with you online. I am 15 years old. You got catfished by a dude! It will only get worse. It's time to retire. I want you to know that I'm not releasing the story for money. I am doing this to teach you a lesson. I want you to get help. I don't care if you hate me. I don't hate you, I care about you very much. I think this story will help you become a better person. I hope at least. I am also worried about myself. I talk with a lot of men online. I am fifteen years old! I catfish people, including you. I think it's time that I retire too. I think that by releasing this story I am teaching myself a lesson as well. I need to get help. I hate myself. I am trying to make this story into something positive. In order for a flashlight to work properly it requires a battery. The battery requires a negative and a positive, the negative is always larger.. It doesn't have to be that way. Sorry, I'm not sorry. I wish you the best! \n \n At one point, when Weiner questions them talking, the girl says she could give him '100 good reasons as to why we should keep talking'",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Anthony Weiner's sexting wrecked his political career, his comeback attempt, his media career, and his marriage\u2014and now even his freedom could be at stake. The AP reports that the former congressman's alleged online relationship with a 15-year-old girl is being investigated by authorities in New York and in North Carolina, where the girl lives. A spokeswoman for the US attorney's office in North Carolina says they've \"begun investigative efforts,\" and sources tell CNN that prosecutors in New York have already subpoenaed the 52-year-old's phone records and other communication. An FBI task force in New York is also looking into the matter, a law enforcement source says. According to the Daily Mail, which first reported Weiner's communication with the underage girl, Weiner's explicit messages included one where he told the high school sophomore he would \"make her limp for a week.\" The girl says Weiner\u2014who allegedly called himself \"T Dog\" this time instead of \"Carlos Danger\"\u2014asked her to undress and touch herself, and the New York Daily News notes that encouraging a child under 17 to \"engage in a sexual performance\" can carry a 15-year sentence in New York. Weiner has admitted communicating with the girl and demonstrating \"terrible judgment\" online, but he also claims to have been \"the subject of a hoax.\"",

She's a trilingual honors student who's publicly passionate about women's health and down to clown with Jimmy Kimmel; she's got a squeaky-clean image and a squeaky-clean resume. But it's missing one unflattering detail. \n \n In late April 2013, Jezebel has learned, Kazantsev and a friend were both kicked out of the Alpha Phi sorority at Hofstra University on Long Island after hazing pledges. At the time, Kazantsev was serving as the sorority's head of recruitment. \n \n Kazantsev is well-spoken, quick on her feet, and perky. She's the third consecutive Miss New York to win the title of Miss America, and she did with the added handicap of a hammy Anna Kendrick impression. In the days since she earned the crown, Kazantsev has diplomatically but firmly addressed the loud-mouthed buffoons who have taken issue with her past internship at Planned Parenthood, telling Cosmopolitan, \"It was close to my university and I care about women's health. It's really important that teens know what resources are available to them and learn to be respectful of their bodies and other peoples' bodies.\" \n \n Kazantsev's Miss New York press kit describes a daughter of Russian immigrants who is fluent in Spanish and Russian and maintained a 3.6 GPA while triple majoring in Political Science, Geography, and Global Studies at Hofstra. And under \"leadership roles,\" listed right under a platform called \"Love Shouldn't Hurt\"\u2014a timely and important advocacy push against domestic violence\u2014you'll learn that Kazantsev served as \"Alpha Phi Sorority New Member Educator and Recruitment Committee President.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n After Kazantsev's win last week, neither the national Alpha Phi organization nor the Hofstra branch of Alpha Phi (Theta Mu) publicly acknowledged that one of their own had just won the most prestigious beauty pageant in the world; nor did the local chapter and national organization recognize Kazantsev's considerable achievement. The organization's affiliated foundation was also silent, despite the fact that pictures of Kazantsev participating in Alpha Phi events are all over Facebook. \n \n Advertisement \n \n According to a tipster close to Kazantsev, those omissions were no accident. After returning from her fall 2012 study abroad semester in Spain, Kazantsev began her term as Alpha Phi's Recruitment Committee President for the incoming pledges. Kazantsev and her best friend (another Alpha Phi sister who was also her roommate), our source says, were exceptionally harsh toward the pledges. (In the tipster's words, they made the recruits' lives \"a living hell.\") Under Kira's supervision, according to the source, pledges in the incoming class were called names, berated for their perceived physical flaws and imperfections, and made to perform physical tasks to the point of bruising and exhaustion\u2014standard sorority pledge stuff paid forward by a person who our source says was herself brutally hazed upon entry into Alpha Phi. \n \n Hofstra's attempts to control hazing predate Kazantsev's time in Alpha Phi. In an attempt to cull the campus's headline-making abuse (and the ensuing student health and PR nightmares that followed in its wake), Hofstra has been quick to act decisively in response to hazing. According to the University's code of conduct, hazing includes: \n \n Any action or situation that recklessly or intentionally endangers mental or physical health or involves the forced consumption of liquor or drugs for the purpose of initiation into or affiliation with any organization. Any other act or series of acts that cause or are likely to cause mental or physical harm or danger. Mistreatment by playing stunts or practicing abusive, humiliating or ridiculous tricks that subject an individual to personal indignity, humiliation or ridicule. Harassment by exacting unnecessary, disagreeable, or difficult work or harassment by banter, ridicule or criticism. Some examples of such prohibited activities are: Abnormal or unusual dress holding the wearer up to ridicule, e.g., extraordinary headwear, costumes, underwear, body painting, etc. Performing unusual or abnormal acts, e.g., dancing on tables, standing at attention, standing on windowsills, blindfolding, etc. Excessive or unusual physical activities, e.g., crawling, duckwalk, push-ups, sit-ups, skipping, hopping, squatting, etc. Verbal or written harassment or abuse, e.g., yelling, making demeaning remarks, etc. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Student leaders are told in no uncertain terms that if they're caught hazing, the entire frat or sorority risks being tossed off campus. \n \n But just because rules exist doesn't mean they're followed, and socially-enforced silence among fraternity and sorority members has allowed remnants of a particularly nasty culture to flourish underground. A recent graduate who attended Hofstra at the same time as Kazantsev told Jezebel that the final two steps of pledging in one (unnamed) sorority involved making all of the pledges remove their underwear and sit on newspapers while the older members forced them to watch lesbian porn. Anyone whose newspaper stuck to them at the end of the video, the former student said, was branded a dyke, ridiculed, and tossed out. The remaining girls were then forced to perform oral sex on their sorority \"big sisters.\" Other Greeks required pledges to sit in circles around bowls of cat food and other various inedibles. They'd take turns eating and as soon as someone threw up, they had to eat the puke. Another sorority would wrap completely naked pledges in tinfoil, take them to bars, and instruct them to dance until last call. Patrons would pull pieces of foil off, and pledges were considered sexually up for grabs. \n \n These, of course, are extreme examples, and not necessarily attributed to Kazantsev's sorority. Students can be suspended from Greek life or removed from campus for much less, and for much more. In the last decade, more than a dozen college students have died while participating in the pledging process, and uncounted thousands have been hospitalized due to alcohol abuse encouraged as a routine part of many Greeks' hazing processes. But it's impossible for university officials to know what's going on if everyone keeps quiet. \n \n Advertisement \n \n When someone reported Kazantsev and her friend for \"dirty pledging,\" Hofstra didn't turn a blind eye. After a months-long investigation into their actions, our source says, the pair was expelled from Alpha Phi in late 2013 and told they could no longer participate in any sorority activities, including the end-of-year formal. Kira and her bestie attended the formal, anyway, but had to sneak in with their dates. \n \n FERPA rules prohibit university officials from discussing details of disciplinary cases publicly or divulging details of what specific behavior got Kazantsev booted, but when I called Hofstra University to look into allegations I described as relating to \"a high-profile individual who was expelled from her sorority in late April 2013,\" the representative who spoke with me responded, \"Was this person, by chance, in Atlantic City last Sunday night?\" She then assured me that she'd tell me what she could, which amounted to very little, aside from that damningly leading hypothetical. Additional Hofstra students who were on campus at the same time as Kazantsev corroborated the story that Miss America had been kicked out of her sorority for behavior her University characterizes as abusive. \n \n The Miss America organization was more forthcoming. When I reached out to them last week to ask them if they were aware of Kazantsev's hazing history, a kind and personable representative who seemed taken aback by the allegations told me that they'd get back to me with a statement. Hours later, a spokeswoman from the organization sent this statement: \n \n Kira has been fully transparent with the MissAmerica Organization about her termination from the Alpha Phi sorority. It's unfortunate that this incident has been exploited to create a storyline that distracts from what we should be focusing on: Kira's impressive academic achievements at Hofstra University, including earning a triple major from the Honors College and her commitment to serving her community. Kira is an exceptional ambassador for the MissAmerica Organization, and we are excited to be a part of her journey as a force for good across our nation, promoting education and service and working to empower young women. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The Miss America and Miss New York organizations weren't exactly as \"transparent\" with the viewing public as they say Kazantsev was with them. \n \n This news shouldn't serve to take down Kazantsev; if anything, it might even be an opportunity for her. Good people sometimes do bad things, and discussing how they happened, how they developed, and how to keep other good people from doing the same bad things could make some kind of dent in a collegiate culture of hazing abuse. Because\u2014to adapt a quote from Kira Kazantsev's platform\u2014sisterly love shouldn't hurt. ||||| (Read more from Tuesday morning: Miss America goes on Good Morning America to deny hazing abuse) \n \n \n \n Miss America, Kira Kazantsev, poses for photographers during the traditional toe dip in the Atlantic Ocean the morning after she was crowned. (Julio Cortez/AP) \n \n (Updated Monday night with statement from Kazantsev below saying the allegations of hazing are not true.) \n \n Beauty pageants are frequently a source of controversy after the fact, and Miss America is no exception. Barely a week after Miss New York Kira Kazantsev won the crown, pageant officials acknowledged that she had been kicked out of her college sorority last year. Why? They would not discuss the matter, but their statement appeared to confirm a new report that she was involved in hazing pledges. \n \n Yes, in case you\u2019re wondering, this is the new Miss America whose social cause is protecting women against domestic violence. \n \n Jezebel broke the story on Monday afternoon and cited an anonymous source who detailed acts of hazing during Kazantsev\u2019s reign as recruitment committee president in the Alpha Phi sorority at Hofstra University: \n \n Under Kira\u2019s supervision, according to the source, pledges in the incoming class were called names, berated for their perceived physical flaws and imperfections, and made to perform physical tasks to the point of bruising and exhaustion \u2014 standard sorority pledge stuff paid forward by a person who our source says was herself brutally hazed upon entry into Alpha Phi. \n \n Kazantsev \u2014 who made headlines during the pageant with her quirky talent singing \u201cHappy\u201d while playing a beat on a red plastic cup\u2014 was kicked out of Alpha Phi after someone reported these incidents and there was an investigation, Jezebel said. \n \n Pageant officials released a statement to the site, saying that \u201cKira has been fully transparent with the Miss America Organization about her termination from the Alpha Phi sorority.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this incident has been exploited to create a storyline that distracts from what we should be focusing on: Kira\u2019s impressive academic achievements at Hofstra University, including earning a triple major from the Honors College and her commitment to serving her community,\u201d they added, going on to praise Kazantsev as a worthy ambassador of the crown. \n \n When contacted by The Post, a pageant spokesperson didn\u2019t answer specific questions about when and how Kazantsev was \u201ctransparent\u201d about the incident \u2014 it certainly didn\u2019t come up during the live broadcast on Sept. 14. The spokesperson sent us the same statement as it had to Jezebel, though instead of the phrase \u201cfully transparent,\u201d they said Kazantsev \u201chas been very open and candid about her termination from the Alpha Phi sorority.\u201d \n \n \u201cKira is an exceptional ambassador for the Miss America Organization, and we are excited to be a part of her journey as a force for good across our nation, promoting education and service and working to empower young women,\u201d the statement said. \n \n UPDATE, Monday night \n \n A pageant spokesperson said that Kazantsev will appear on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday morning to address the allegations of hazing, which she says are not true. Monday night, Kazantsev also posted a long entry describing the incident on her Web site, explaining that she was kicked out of the sorority because of a hazing joke in an e-mail chain that was taken out of context. When she didn\u2019t show up for her disciplinary hearing about the issue (it was the end of her senior year and she was focused on graduation) her membership was terminated. \n \n Kazantsev said when she was pledging, there was some \u201cso-called hazing\u201d in Alpha Phi, the worst of which involved \u201cstanding in a line reciting information, a few sleepless nights, and crafting.\u201d (The sorority was later reprimanded by Hofstra and the national chapter.) Kazantsev admitted that when she became the new member educator, she was in charge of similar events, but that was unrelated to her termination. \n \n \u201cI was never involved with any name-calling or use of profanity toward a girl during my time with the sorority. I was never involved in any physical hazing or any degradation of physical appearance of any kind,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis has all been immensely taken out of context and manipulated purposefully because I am now in a public position.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe nameless source that is saying these things is doing exactly what it is that I was wrongfully accused of,\u201d she added. \n \n For the record, this is the second PR crisis the Miss America organization had to deal with on Monday. John Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d took the pageant to task for claiming to \u201cprovide\u201d $45 million in scholarships. He fact-checked the numbers and found it\u2019s actually the amount technically available for theoretical contestants \u2014 but a much higher figure than the amount doled out in reality. Obviously, the video went viral:",

    "document": "David Steele, 42, a veteran race car driver who won several sprint car series championships and competed in some IndyCar and NASCAR races, was killed in a wreck during a sprint car race Saturday night at Desoto Speedway, according to multiple sources. \n \n Steele, a multiple United States Auto Club national champion and two-time winner of the Little 500, was competing in the Southern Sprint Car Shootout Series race at the 3/8-mile asphalt track on State Road 64 East in east Bradenton. \n \n His death quickly brought stunned reactions across social media. \n \n \u201cTonight I am stunned to hear that Dave Steele has been killed in a sprint car,\u201d wrote Andy Cobb, a professional dirt sprint car driver, on Facebook late Saturday. \u201cDave has been one of my closest racing friends for a long time. I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d \n \n Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \n \n On Twitter, Hendrick Motorsports driver Alex Bowman wrote: \u201cMan, I love open wheel racing, but something has to change. RIP Dave Steele. One of the best pavement sprint car and midget guys ever.\u201d \n \n Steele, a native of Indianapolis who resided in Tampa, made starts in the NASCAR XFINITY Series and the Verizon IndyCar Series in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but he returned to his short-track roots. His racing background included Silver Crown (USAC), sprint car and midget racing. Steele, who was the USAC Silver Crown champion in 2004, won more USAC races than Al Unser, had more sprint car victories on asphalt than Tony Stewart and more midget wins than Jeff Gordon, according to multiple websites affiliated with Steele. \n \n Tony Stewart Racing was one of the first to react on social media: \u201cOur prayers go out to the family of Dave Steele, our former teammate, he was one of the best open-wheel drivers of this era.\u201d \n \n Steele was no stranger to success at the Desoto Speedway track: He won four southern Sprint Car Series events at the track last year. On Saturday, he was seeking his 100th career sprint car victory just in the state of Florida. He was already a multiple-time winner this year, with victories at 4-17 Southern Speedway in Punta Gorda in February and at Showtime Speedway in Pinellas Park. \n \n The field, which was turning speeds of more than 100 mph during the qualifying heats and warmups according to a source in attendance, had just taken the green flag to start the 35-lap main event, which capped Saturday night\u2019s race card, and was not yet up to race speed at the time of the incident. \n \n Steele, who was starting near the rear of the 16-car field, got a good jump at the start and tried to pass a vehicle in front of him on the outside heading into Turn 1. \n \n Steele\u2019s car and the car he was passing got together and hooked wheels, sending Steele\u2019s vehicle flipping airborne. \n \n The Southern Sprint Car Series vehicles are open-wheel winged cars with the driver enclosed in a steel roll cage. In the winged configuration, the cars have a small wing over the nose (two vertical panels separated by a flat horizontal panel spanning the width of the nose). A larger, similarly configured wing is over the driver\u2019s compartment. \n \n Steele\u2019s vehicle hit the outside retaining wall in Turn 1 and then spun perpendicular to the track before coming to rest. According to the source, his car was not hit by another vehicle after it struck the wall and the visible damage to the car was consistent with a vehicle hitting the outside wall flush on the left side. \n \n According to multiple sources, the race was immediately red flagged and track emergency personnel were at the vehicle in seconds. According to a source affiliated with the track who was not authorized to speak on the record, the track has multiple fully-trained medics, EMTs and firefighters at the track for each race card. That was the case Saturday night as well. \n \n Despite the rapid response, Steele was pronounced dead on the track. Track personnel, emergency personnel and local authorities called to the track after the incident were still on the track at the crash scene near midnight. Track personnel, race officials and other witnesses were waiting to be cleared to leave the facility. \n \n Early Sunday morning, Desoto Speedway released an official statement on its Facebook page: \u201cDesoto Speedway owners and staff are saddened by tonight\u2019s passing of David Steele in the Sprint car feature. Thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends who were all in attendance, to see him try to win his 100th florida(sic) race.\u201d \n \n The source affiliated with the track said the track planned to have no other statement Saturday night or Sunday. \n \n The racing related fatality is the first at the speedway in many years. Driver Butch Lindley sustained fatal injuries in an accident in 1985 during a late model sportsman race. However, he lingered in a coma for five years, without regaining consciousness, before dying in 1990. Steele\u2019s death is the first in the Southern Sprint Car Series, which is only in its second season. Steele was the defending series champion. \n \n Joey \u201cThe Ace\u201d Aguilar narrowly escaped death in a fiery wreck in 2013 at the facility, then known as Full Throttle Speedway. The driver suffered burns all over his body, but was cleared to return to racing a little more than a month later. \n \n According to the source affiliated with the track, racing weather and track conditions were good at the time of the crash and there had been no incidents in the heats leading up to the main event involving Steele\u2019s car or any other car. \n \n Steele, who would have turned 43 on May 7, is survived by his wife, Lynn Bunn Steele, and three young children.

    "document": "Here\u2019s another reason to think twice before you post photos of yourself on the Internet: The New York Times reported Sunday that the National Security Agency collects millions of photos each day from electronic communication and analyzes them as part of a major facial recognition effort. \n \n According to the leaked documents obtained by the Times, of the millions of images it collects daily, the NSA harvests about 55,000 that it considers to be \u201cfacial recognition quality.\u201d \n \n The report says that \u201cit is not clear how many people around the world, and how many Americans, might have been caught up in the effort,\u201d and goes on to state that current US privacy and surveillance laws don\u2019t specifically protect against the use of facial recognition technology to identify individuals. \n \n The NSA\u2019s facial recognition program is separate from the agency\u2019s bulk metadata collection program, which collects information such as which phone numbers you\u2019ve dialed. According to the Times, the NSA still needs to get court approval to collect images from American citizens, since they fall under the same legal umbrella as the content of an email or the audio from a phone call\u2014neither of which can be collected without a warrant. \n \n For its part, an NSA spokesperson tells the Times that the agency can\u2019t get at driver\u2019s license or passport photo databases, but the agency refused to say whether it collects photos from social media \u201cthrough means other than communications intercepts.\u201d \n \n Although these specific revelations are new, experts have voiced concerns about the impact of facial recognition technology on your privacy for a number of years. \n \n In 2011, Facebook introduced a feature that could automatically tag people in photos, which had privacy activists up in arms. Senator Al Franken went on the record in 2012 to call for controls on how companies and government agencies can use facial recognition technology to identify individuals. And in 2013, the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit over the FBI\u2019s use of facial recognition. ||||| The selfie phenomenon is undoubtedly making the NSA\u2019s job easier by producing a mountain of tagged online data to feed its facial recognition algorithms. \n \n A report in The New York Times, based on documents from 2011 obtained by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, reveals that the US security agency\u2019s reliance on facial recognition technology has grown significantly under the Obama administration \u2014 coinciding with a rise in popularity of taking and tagging self portraits on online social networks. \n \n The newspaper reports that the agency has turned to new software to process the flood of images being included in digital communication including social media, email, messaging, videoconferencing and other types of online comms. The 2011 documents show that agency officials believe technological advances in facial recognition software could revolutionize the way the NSA finds intelligence targets around the world. \n \n According to the documents, the agency intercepts \u201cmillions\u201d of images per day \u2014 including about 55,000 \u201cfacial recognition quality images\u201d \u2014 although it is not clear how many images the agency has amassed in total at this point. The NSA describes facial recognition technology as offering \u201ctremendous untapped potential\u201d for tracking intelligence targets. \n \n As well as its own in-house facial recognition software, the documents cited in the report note that the NSA also relies on commercially available facial recognition tech, including PittPatt \u2014 a company owned by Google \u2014 to process the data it is harvesting. \n \n Facial images, fingerprints and other identifiers are now considered just as important to the NSA as written and oral communications, according to the report. \n \n The paper says the NSA\u2019s use of facial recognition technology goes far beyond previously detailed efforts. Back in February it emerged that the NSA and UK spy agency GCHQ had run a joint program harvesting webcam imagery from Yahoo users, between 2008 and 2012, which included the collection of sexually explicit material. \n \n While the NYT notes that the NSA does not have access to US state databases of drivers\u2019 licenses or to passport photos of Americas (no such luck if you\u2019re a foreigner of course), it\u2019s likely that the mountain of tagged online data it can now sift through means it can obtain that intel on US citizens from other sources \u2014 such as, presumably, Facebook, Instagram et al.\u2019s huge store of selfies. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not just the traditional communications we\u2019re after: It\u2019s taking a full-arsenal approach that digitally exploits the clues a target leaves behind in their regular activities on the net to compile biographic and biometric information [that can help] implement precision targeting,\u201d a 2010 agency document notes. \n \n An agency spokeswoman contacted by the NYT reporters declined to say whether it collects facial imagery of Americans from Facebook and other social media through means other than communications intercepts. But that \u2018no comment\u2019 speaks volumes. \n \n Facial recognition software is about as big brother as technology gets right now. Facebook, which is of course already in possession of its own data mountain of tagged facial imagery, is hard at work perfecting its own facial recognition software, under an initiative called the DeepFace project. Back in March Facebook announced that DeepFace was nearing human levels of accuracy at identifying a face in a crowd (97.25% vs the average human score of 97.5%). \n \n Such commercial efforts undoubtedly make the NSA\u2019s job easier, since the more accurately tagged imagery Facebook has, the more data effectively becomes available for harvesting by the NSA. Especially as US privacy laws provide no express protection for facial recognition data, as the NYT report notes. \n \n That said, an NSA spokeswoman notes that images are considered a form of communications content in the US, so the NSA would require court approval for imagery of Americans collected through its surveillance programs \u2014 in the same way that it does to read their emails or eavesdrop on their phone calls.

Yet, until recently, no one could decide on when exactly Her Majesty would make history. Dates ranging from Sept. 9 to Sept. 11 were posited. The calculations themselves give different results, depending on whether days alone are counted, or years and days, or years, months and days. \n \n When Martin Willis, a professor of Victorian literature at the University of Westminster in London put his own extensive calculations online\u2014he went for Sept. 10\u2014he was stunned to realize his post was being read, and commented on, by people around the world. In late November, he got an email out of the blue from Buckingham Palace. They\u2019d seen his work and were emailing to notify him that the Royal Archives had done its own more exhaustive investigation, using the number of days and, yes, hours for both queens. \n \n When contacted by Maclean\u2019s, the palace confirmed the information given Willis. Victoria\u2019s reign lasted 23,226 days, 16 hours and 23 minutes. Elizabeth II is expected to pass that record on Sept. 9, 2015, at around 5:30 p.m., local time in Britain. As Willis says, \u201cThey\u2019ve got first dibs on this. I\u2019m quite willing to accept that.\u201d \n \n Like her predecessor, Elizabeth II is expected to be at Balmoral. Victoria didn\u2019t want Empire-wide celebrations to mark the event. The current monarch seems to agree.

The nuptials came over a year and a half after Oswalt\u2019s first wife, Michelle McNamara, died unexpectedly in her sleep. \n \n Here\u2019s a look back at how Oswalt\u2019s life has changed since last April. \n \n A tragic loss \n \n Oswalt wed crime writer McNamara in 2005, and the two welcomed a daughter, Alice Rigney, in 2009. \n \n On April 21, 2016, McNamara died in her sleep at age 46. In an instant, Oswalt became a widower \u2014 and single parent. \n \n Patton Oswalt and Michelle McNamara in December 2011 Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic \n \n In an October 2016 interview with The New York Times, Oswalt recounted the last night he had with his wife, speculating that she may have accidentally overdosed. \n \n McNamara, who was writing a book about a serial rapist and killer at the time, was working long days and nights and unable to sleep due to anxiety and nightmares. Worried about her health, Oswalt suggested she take a night to \u201csleep until you wake up.\u201d McNamara took some Xanax and went to sleep \u2014 but never woke up. \n \n The next morning, Oswalt remembered waking up early to get Alice dressed, packed and off to school. On the way home, he picked up an Americano coffee and left it on McNamara\u2019s bedside table \u2014 around 9:40 a.m., he recalled. \n \n Hours later, he checked to see if his wife was up yet. She was still in bed \u2014 not breathing. The paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene. While a cause of death was not declared by the coroner\u2019s office at the time, Oswalt said he believed the Xanax was to blame. \n \n In February, Oswalt revealed McNamara\u2019s cause of death: \u201cWe learned today the combination of drugs in Michelle\u2019s system, along with a condition we were unaware of, proved lethal,\u201d he wrote in a statement to the Associated Press. \n \n Oswalt also explained that the couple had \u201cno idea\u201d McNamara had a heart condition that caused blockages in her arteries. According to Oswalt, the blockages, combined with her taking the medications Adderall, Xanax and the pain medication fentanyl, were responsible for her passing. \n \n Learning to cope \n \n On the one-year anniversary of her death, Oswalt remembered his late wife in a lengthy Facebook post \u2014 expressing a combination of grief, gratitude and perseverance. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s awful, but it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d Oswalt began. \u201cThat\u2019s the dispatch I\u2019m sending back from exactly one year into this shadow-slog.\u201d \n \n He went on to say that he had removed his wedding ring and placed it in a box of keepsakes. \n \n \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear removing it since April 21st, 2016,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut now it felt obscene. That anonymous poem about the man mourning his dead lover for a year and a day, for craving a kiss from her \u2018clay cold lips.\u2019 I was inviting more darkness. Removing the ring was removing the last symbol of denial of who I was now, and what my life is, and what my responsibilities are. But it\u2019s not fatal.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not making today any sort of dark ritual or painful memorial. No graveside visit. Those are for when Alice and I have something exciting to say to her. No candle lighting or balloon launching. We think of her every day \u2014 she\u2019s still so tied into our worlds, in a way that\u2019s encouraging, and energizing. So why light a flame that will die, or release a balloon that will disappear? Michelle\u2019s gone but she wasn\u2019t the kind of soul that disappears or dies out.\u201d \n \n A new beginning \n \n In June, Oswalt stepped out for the premiere of Baby Driver with a very special guest by his side: his girlfriend Salenger. The couple held hands while posing for the cameras. \n \n Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salenger at the Baby Driver premiere Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic \n \n Salenger \u2014 a 47-year-old Harvard-educated actress with credits in TV and films including Lake Placid and Hollywood Heights, plus voiceover work for cartoons like Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2014 also tweeted an adorable selfie with Oswalt in the theater. \n \n At the time, a source close to the couple told PEOPLE the relationship was \u201cnew\u201d and the two were \u201cvery happy.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey met through mutual friend Martha Plimpton,\u201d said the insider. \u201cThey started chatting as friends and it blossomed from there.\u201d \n \n A month later, PEOPLE exclusively confirmed that Oswalt and Salenger were engaged. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s official.

And SO well-written,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI expected some bitter grub worms to weigh in (anonymously, always always always) with their much-needed opinions when I announced my engagement last week. And I decided to ignore them. But yeah, I felt this rage. And Erica articulated it better than I could have ever hoped. So there you go. Thank you, Erica.\u201d \n \n Salenger also posted Roman\u2019s article alongside her own defense of the couple\u2019s engagement. \n \n \u201cEveryone has been so lovely to us\u2026 ALL of Michelle\u2019s siblings and friends and family\u2026 a few trolls have strong opinions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I think for Patton, having met and found love after over a year of intense therapy and openly grieving and dealing with his pain\u2026I am grateful to be the one who helps him climb out of the depths of grief and find some joy again. And most of all\u2026 Alice is happy and feels loved.\u201d \n \n \u201cI have waited 47 years to find true love,\u201d she continued. \u201cCreating our family unit while honoring the brilliant gift Michelle has given me will be my life\u2019s goal and happiness. I am deeply in love with both Patton and Alice and very much looking forward to a beautiful happy life having adventures together.\u201d \n \n WATCH: Patton Oswalt Opens Up About Emotional Wedding to Meredith Salenger: \u2018This Is a New Level of Joy and a New Life\u2019 \n \n Staying strong for Alice \n \n Since McNamara\u2019s death, Oswalt\u2019s top priority is taking care of their daughter. \n \n \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had a daughter and my wife died, we wouldn\u2019t be talking right now. I\u2019m not saying I would be dead, but I would be a shut-in alcoholic,\u201d he told Playboy in August. \u201cEverything would have shut down. I wouldn\u2019t have been about anything. But with Alice, it was and is \u2018You got to get up.\u2019 \u201d \n \n \u201cThere were times when I had to get her to play a game on her iPad or start a little project, and then I would say, \u2018Oh, let me go upstairs,\u2019 and I would go put my head in a pillow and just scream and cry because I didn\u2019t want to break down in front of her,\u201d he confessed. \n \n Still, the father-daughter duo opted to stay in their family home, admitting that a move \u201cwould have been more painful,\u201d and have felt like they were \u201crunning away from Michelle\u2019s ghost.\u201d \n \n And at the end of the day, Oswalt said he chose to move forward with his life for the sake of his daughter. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m moving forward \u2014 clumsily, stupidly, blindly \u2014 because of the kind of person Alice is,\u201d he wrote in a December 2016 first-person essay for GQ. \u201cShe\u2019s got so much of Michelle in her. And Michelle was living her life moving forward. And she took me forward with her. Just like I know Alice will. So I\u2019m going to keep moving forward. So I can be there with you if you need me, Alice. Because I\u2019ll need you. \n \n \u201cI can do it,\u201d he added. \u201cI can do it. I can do it. Because of you, Alice.\u201d",

(Associated Press) \n \n State TV, citing the health minister, said the death toll could rise. Gruesome images of the scene were aired, with mangled and charred corpses, bloodstained streets and twisted steel. \n \n \"All our windows and doors are blown out,\" said Majed Seibiyah, 29, who lives in the area. \"I was sleeping when I heard a sound like an earthquake. I didn't grasp what was happening until I hear screaming in the street.\" \n \n The blasts were the latest in a string of mysterious, large-scale attacks targeting the Syrian regime's military and security installations. The previous blasts, all suicide bombings, killed dozens of people since December, even as the regime wages a bloody crackdown against the year-old uprising against President Bashar Assad. \n \n The government has blamed the explosions on the \"terrorists\" that it claims are behind the revolt. The opposition has denied any role, saying they believe forces loyal to the government are behind the bombings to tarnish the uprising. \n \n But top U.S. intelligence officials also have pointed to al-Qaida in Iraq as the likely culprit behind the previous bombings, raising the possibility its fighters are infiltrating across the border to take advantage of the turmoil. \n \n Al-Qaida's leader called for Assad's ouster in February. \n \n A suspected al-Qaida presence creates new obstacles for the U.S., its Western allies and Arab states trying to figure out a way to help push Assad from power, and may also rally Syrian religious minorities, fearful of Sunni radicalism, to get behind the regime. \n \n Bassma Kodmani, a member of the opposition Syrian National Council, said she doubted armed groups trying to bring Assad down by force, such as the rebel Free Syrian Army, have the capacity to carry out such attacks on security institutions in the capital. \n \n \"I don't think any of the opposition forces or the free Syrian army has the capacity to do such an operation to target these buildings because they are fortresses,\" she said by telephone. \"They are very well guarded. There is no way anyone can penetrate them without having strong support and complicity from inside the security apparatus.\" \n \n According to SANA, preliminary information indicated two blasts were caused by car bombs that hit the aviation intelligence department and the criminal security department at 7:30 a.m local time. Shooting broke out soon after the blast and sent residents and others who had gathered in the area fleeing, an Associated Press reporter at the scene said. \n \n A Syrian official also said there were reports of a third blast Saturday targeting a military bus at the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, but there were no details. He asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \n \n The Syrian government denies there is a popular will behind the uprising, saying foreign extremists and gangs are trying to destroy the country. But his opponents deny that and say an increasingly active rebel force has been driven to take up arms because the government used tanks, snipers and machine guns to crush peaceful protests. \n \n The U.N. estimates that more that 8,000 people have been killed since the uprising against Assad began last March. \n \n The last major suicide bombing in Syria happened on Feb. 10, when twin blasts struck security compounds in the government stronghold of Aleppo in northern Syria, killing 28 people. Damascus, another Assad stronghold, has seen three suicide previous bombings since December. \n \n In recent weeks, Syrian forces have waged a series of heavy offensives against the main strongholds of the opposition _ Homs in central Syria, Idlib in the north and Daraa in the south. \n \n The bloodshed fuels the country's sectarian tensions. The military's top leadership is stacked heavily with members of the minority Alawite sect, to which Assad and the ruling elite belong. \n \n Sunnis are the majority in the country of 22 million and make up the backbone of the opposition. \n \n Diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis have so far brought no result. But U.N. envoy Kofi Annan told the Security Council in a briefing Friday that he would return to Damascus even though his recent talks with Assad saw no progress in attempts to cobble together peace negotiations between the two sides. \n \n After the confidential briefing via videolink, Annan told reporters in Geneva that he urged the council \"to speak with one voice as we try to resolve the crisis in Syria.\" Russia and China have blocked U.N. action against Assad's regime. \n \n \"The first objective is for all of us to end the violence and human rights abuses and the killings and get unimpeded access for humanitarian access to the needy, and of course the all-important issue of political process that will lead to a democratic Syria,\" Annan said. \n \n Both Assad and much of the opposition spurned Annan's appeal for talks. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Albert Aji contributed to this story from Damascus, Syria. ||||| At least 27 people have been killed and 97 others wounded in a pair of explosions in Damascus, the Syrian health minister has said. \n \n State television blamed \"terrorists\" for the Saturday morning explosions and reported that vehicles packed with explosives had been used. The blasts targeted buildings belonging to a customs office and air force intelligence. \n \n Most of the casualties were civilians, state television said. The channel broadcast interviews with Syrians who blamed the attack on the United States and Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who they said had sent terrorists. \n \n The attacks come two days after the one-year anniversary of the start of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n \"I woke up to two massive explosions around 7:30 this morning - one was on Baghdad street less than a mile away from my home,\" a witness in Damascus told Al Jazeera. \"Relatives closer to the explosion told me their windows were blown out and doors destroyed from the blast.\" \n \n Bassma Kodmani, a Paris-based member of the opposition Syrian National Council, said she doubted the armed groups trying to bring Assad down by force have the capacity to carry out such attacks on security institutions in the capital. \n \n \"I don't think any of the opposition forces or the Free Syrian Army has the capacity to do such an operation to target these buildings because they are fortresses,'' she said. \"They are very well guarded. There is no way anyone can penetrate them without having strong support and complicity from inside the security apparatus.\" \n \n State-run news agency SANA said a third blast went off near a military bus at the Palestinian refugee camp Yarmouk in Damascus later in the day, killing the two suicide bombers. \n \n No claim of responsibility \n \n It was not the first time bombers have struck in Damascus, the heart of Assad's power base. There were three alleged suicide bombings in the capital between December and January, which the government blamed on al-Qaeda. \n \n \"A few weeks ago, we saw security buildings also come under attack [in Aleppo] and the government has been blaming what they are calling 'terrorist groups',\" said Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut. \n \n She said no one had claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks but that the opposition has in the past blamed the government for \"orchestrating\" them to bolster its case against alleged terrorists. \n \n \"But we also have to remember that US officials have hinted in the past that they believe that al-Qaeda could be involved, could be taking advantage of the security vacuum in that country,\" Khodr said. \n \n The spectre of al-Qaeda could make Syria's minority populations more nervous about the Sunni-led uprising against Assad, whose government has sought to rally Alawite, Christian and Shia communities to its side. \n \n One of Saturday's blasts happened in al-Qassaa, a predominantly Christian area. \n \n International condemnation \n \n UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the bomb blasts and called for an immediate end to the violence. \n \n \"Mr Ban extended his sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Syria,\" a statement from the secretary-general's office said. \n \n Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said: \"France condemns all acts of terrorism, which cannot be justified under any circumstances.\" \n \n France has been at the forefront of calls for Assad to quit. \n \n Mohammed Kamel Amr, Egypt's foreign minister, affirmed Cairo's \"fixed position against terrorism in any form, regardless of the reasons behind it\". \n \n Meanwhile, the Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an opposition activist network, said 22 people were killed across the country on Saturday, including eight in the northwestern city of al-Raqqa where security forces reportedly opened fire on a funeral march. \n \n Al-Raqqa saw a rare mass rally against Assad on Friday and activists said several people were killed by gunfire. \n \n Clashes between the military and army defectors were also reported in the city on Saturday. The LCC said security forces had besieged the hospital that admitted most of the injured.",

We don't exist.\" \n \n Tsu is a tiny new social network that claims to share its advertising revenue with its users. \n \n Unlike most social media sites, including Facebook, which keep 100% of the profit from the ads displayed on your page, Tsu only keeps 10%. You keep 45%. The chain of friends that invited you to Tsu split the rest. \n \n That means there's a financial incentive to post on Tsu, invite people to Tsu, and direct people to your Tsu page. There's even incentive to send people to the Tsu pages of the folks who you brought into the Tsu network. \n \n Your Facebook feed could easily be flooded with Tsu.co links. \n \n And that's exactly what Facebook has encountered. Tsu users were creating fake accounts to boost their pages. Facebook says its users started reporting Tsu.co links as spam, which Facebook defines as \"sending bulk messages, excessively posting links ... and sending friend requests to people you don't know personally.\" \n \n On September 25, Facebook cut off Tsu.co completely. \n \n Tsu said it had been receiving a decent amount of traffic from Facebook, averaging more than 2,534 visits a day. When that dropped to zero, Tsu appealed to Facebook, arguing that it didn't violate Facebook's terms of service, because it did not pay users to push content to Facebook. \n \n It didn't work. \n \n Facebook says it will unblock Tsu if it changes just one thing: Tsu users shouldn't be able to simultaneously post to Tsu and Facebook. \n \n \"We do not allow developers to incentivize content sharing on our platform because it encourages spammy sharing,\" said Melanie Ensign, a Facebook spokesperson. \n \n CNNMoney spoke to a dozen Tsu users. Most are photographers, models and other artists drawn to what they say is Tsu's more equitable pay-for-content program. Most of them haven't made a dime yet. But they feel this Facebook block is unfair. \n \n Claudia Everest is a 47-year-old cancer survivor living in northern England. To pass the time during chemotherapy, she started A Dog A Day, drawing 25 dogs every day and selling her work from home. She's furious that Facebook deleted every post in which she ever mentioned Tsu.co -- 7,500 by her estimate. \n \n \"Facebook either completely removed or labeled them as malicious content,\" she said. \"If you take a look at my cartoons I think you will agree that the idea that my work is malicious is laughable.\" \n \n Carolina Franco, a 28-year-old model in Colombia, thinks Facebook's strategy is an attempt to keep its users from flocking to a competitor. \n \n \"Very few people even know about Tsu,\" she said. \"I don't believe that Facebook and Instagram want Tsu to go viral. it would cost them a lot of money.\" ||||| There's a new social media platform out there \u2014 but Facebook has blocked all mention of it. \n \n Try typing the name Tsu.co into Facebook, Messenger or Instagram and you'll find that you can't. \n \n Tsu, a competing social network with about 4.5 million users, launched in 2014 with a new view of social media in mind. On Tsu, users can earn money based on advertising revenue sharing. It's a business model that's not all that different from YouTube, which is not banned. \n \n Nonetheless, on Sept. 25, Facebook blocked all users from mentioning Tsu.co. Try messaging a friend about tsu.co and you'll get an alert: \"The content you're trying to share includes a link that our security systems detected to be unsafe.\" \n \n tsu.co Facebook is blocking users from posting about Tsu. \n \n \"You can post PornHub links on Facebook, but not tsu.co,\" Tsu founder Sebastian Sobczak told the Daily News. \n \n On top of that, Facebook went back and deleted about 10 million posts referencing Tsu. \n \n While some of the posts were cross-posted between Facebook and Tsu, about 80% were native to Facebook. For instance, if a user posted content \u2014 like a picture or video \u2014 and included links to their other social media accounts, that post has now vanished if one of those profiles was on Tsu \n \n Facebook This is the message Facebook users get if they try to post links to Tsu. \n \n Sometimes, Sobczak said, even links to media coverage about Tsu get blocked. \n \n \"We have the same model that YouTube does,\" he said. \"We want the same rights as YouTube. We have a model that is efficient and dangerous to them.\" \n \n Tsu users get paid when other people view ads associated with content they created. If you're just viewing content \u2014 and not creating it \u2014 you don't get paid. \n \n Facebook Facebook won\u2019t let users talk to one another about social media site Tsu.co. \n \n Unlike Facebook, which keeps all of the profits from ad revenue, Tsu gives 90% back to users \u2014 you get 45% and the chain of friends who invited you get the rest. \n \n Normally, Tsu membership is invite-only, but Sobczak said that because of the increased media attention about Facebook's ban, he has decided to open it up to everyone for the time being. \n \n \"It's so people can try it out and see that there's no malware on your computer,\" he said. \"There's no voodoo magic, it's free.\" \n \n tsu.co Tsu.co has temporarily suspended its invite-only policy. \n \n It may seem like Facebook is just trying to stamp out competing platforms, but the social media giant says that's not the case. \n \n According to Facebook, financially incentivized content violates the company's Platform Policy. \n \n \"We do not allow developers to incentivize content sharing on our platform because it encourages spammy sharing and creates a bad experience for people on Facebook,\" said Facebook spokesperson Melanie Ensign. \n \n Sobczak sees it a little differently. He thinks it's about squashing the competition. \n \n \"We have a model that is efficient and dangerous to them,\" he said. \n \n kblakinger@nydailynews.com ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Suppose every time you posted on Facebook, the social network tallied up the ad revenue it earned against your update and passed a percentage back to you. Of course, Facebook does nothing of the sort \u2014 but its much smaller rival Tsu.co does. \n \n In this Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2015, photo, Sebastian Sobczak, CEO of Tsu.co, poses in his company's New York office. Tsu.co is winning converts to its social network by paying them for their posts. Facebook... (Associated Press) \n \n In this Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2015, photo, Sebastian Sobczak, CEO of Tsu.co, poses in his company's New York office. Tsu.co is winning converts to its social network by paying them for their posts. Facebook... (Associated Press) \n \n Though now Tsu (pronounced \"Sue\") appears to be paying a different sort of price. In late September, Facebook started deleting millions of posts that included links to Tsu \u2014 more than 9.5 million of them, the smaller company claims. Facebook also blocks new posts that merely contain the text \"tsu.co\" but no links, warns users that links to Tsu are \"unsafe\" and fails to deliver Instagram posts and texts via Facebook Messenger that mention Tsu's Internet address or link to the site. \n \n Facebook defends its Tsu ban as a way to prevent its service from turning into a hangout for scam artists and opportunists hoping to make a quick buck. Tsu says Facebook just doesn't want its users to realize that their photos, videos and personal observations might actually be worth something. \n \n Facebook, which has an understandable interest in protecting its 1.5 billion users from an onslaught of digital rubbish, is one of the Internet's largest gatekeepers. That gives it extraordinary sway in determining who can reach its vast membership \u2014 not to mention what those members can discuss using its apps and services. \n \n That can be a big issue when the subject involves a challenge to a company's core business \u2014 in this case, selling advertising against the material Facebook users contribute for free. Facebook has earned $2.1 billion on revenue of $12 billion during the first nine months of this year alone. The company now has a market value of about $300 billion, and no particular interest in generating traffic for a potential competitor. \n \n There's a long history of similar disputes among technology companies, who almost always claim to be acting in the interests of their users. Amazon, for instance, recently yanked Google and Apple streaming-TV devices from its virtual shelves, clearing the way for its own such gadgets. In just the past few days, several banks have blocked outside financial-planning apps from connecting to their systems, citing security concerns. \n \n Tsu, which launched just over a year ago, has grown quickly; CEO Sebastian Sobczak says it has 4 million members. It has raised about $11 million in venture capital. \n \n Facebook's Tsu purge came without warning and affected a swath of users that included rap artist 50 Cent, who shared a link to a video on Tsu with more than 38 million Facebook fans. The team that handles 50 Cent's social media accounts didn't respond to requests for comment. \n \n Facebook says that Tsu pays its users to post links on other sites, an incentive that breaks its rules for connecting with its social network. In a statement, Facebook said it doesn't let outside publishers pay users to post links on its network \"because it encourages spammy sharing.\" The Menlo Park, California, company declined to elaborate. \n \n Sobczak denies that his service is paying people to post links on Facebook. Tsu users are paid based on how much advertising it sells alongside their posts. That revenue-sharing setup is similar to financial models used by major digital services such as Google's YouTube; Facebook users widely share YouTube links with one another. \n \n \"It feels like we are being singled out and they are trying to stop a competitor with a more efficient business model,\" Sobczak says. \"What are they afraid of?\" Sobczak, a former venture capitalist, says Facebook hasn't responded to his inquiries. \n \n Claudia Everest, a frustrated Facebook user who embraced Tsu to find buyers for her $30 drawings of dogs, says Facebook is trying to deflect attention from Tsu's revenue-sharing concept. \n \n \"I don't think they are afraid of Tsu as much as they are of anything that lets people know their content has value,\" says Everest, who lives in Stoke on Trent in England. \"That picture you posted of your dinner last night may not seem like it has value, but it does to the advertisers.\" \n \n Facebook does, however, frequently rejigger its algorithms in ways that sometimes limit how many people see any given post. Such changes have alienated some longtime users such as Kevin Hinkle of Lake Mary, Florida. Hinkle had built a Facebook following of nearly 5,000 people, but felt as if his posts weren't reaching as many people over time. \n \n For Hinkle, the reduced exposure meant fewer people to advise in his self-described role as a \"joyologist.\" He's been pleased with the response on Tsu since he set up an account late last year. Hinkle says he has made about $4,100 on Tsu while averaging 10 to 20 posts per day. \n \n \"Now it looks like it could become a Facebook competitor,\" Hinkle says. \"I think Facebook sees where things could be heading and knows it wouldn't be good for them at all.\" \n \n ---- \n \n Brandon Bailey contributed reporting to this article. \n \n Follow Michael Liedtke at twitter.com/liedtkesfc.

According to the filing, he had no income and his assets included $2 cash and $50 for a cellphone. \n \n His former wife, Jenny Ductant, agreed to take on the couple's debt, which included the power and phone bills. \n \n \"I don't want to talk about it,\" she said Tuesday when reached on her cellphone. \n \n The man Eugene attacked remained in extremely critical condition Monday at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Much of his face was gone, the skin ripped away, the nose bitten and the eyes gouged. \n \n What remained was his goatee and little else. \n \n Photos of the scene with Eugene and his victim quickly went viral on the Internet Monday. \n \n \u0093We\u0092re hoping that he pulls through, for his well-being, but also so he can tell us what happened,\u0094 said Sgt. Javier Ortiz, vice president of the Miami police union. \u0093Only he knows.\u0094 \n \n Details about Eugene's life in South Florida were emerging on Tuesday. \n \n As a teenager, he lived in North Miami-Dade, attending North Miami Beach High and North Miami High, where he was on the football team. \n \n The Miami Herald has obtained photographs of Eugene from North Miami Beach High yearbooks. One photograph was taken in 1997; the other was taken in 1998 when he was a junior. A group shot of the high school football team incudes Eugene. \n \n Eugene transferred to North Miami Senior for his final year of high school, North Miami Beach Principal Raymond Fontana said on Tuesday. \n \n He was killed by police on Saturday as a macabre scene unfolded about 2 p.m. on the MacArthur Causeway\u0092s off-ramp to Biscayne Boulevard just south of the Miami Herald building. A Road Ranger spotted Eugene and his victim in what appeared to be a violent struggle and shouted on his loudspeaker for the naked attacker to back away. \n \n One witness said he was riding his bicycle on the MacArthur when he saw a man tearing off pieces of the victim\u0092s flesh with his mouth. After an officer approached, Larry Vega told WSVN-FOX7, \u0093The guy just stood, his head up like that, with pieces of flesh in his mouth. And he growled.\u0094 \n \n Eugene left behind few clues as to what could have prompted the attack. \n \n \u0093I wouldn\u0092t say he had mental problem but he always felt like people was against him . .. No one was for him, everyone was against him,\u0094 his ex-wife told WPLG. \n \n He had just one arrest to suggest serious violence. Miami Beach police arrested him on a battery charge when he was 16, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The charge was later dropped. \n \n He was arrested seven other times over five years. Court records show that one was for misdemeanor battery, one was for vending near a school, one was for trespassing and four involved marijuana. \n \n The last case came in September 2009. In January, the charge was dropped. \n \n During Saturday\u0092s attack, an officer approached and told Eugene to get off his victim, but Eugene ignored the order and kept chewing, even after the officer shot him once. \n \n The officer fired again, hitting him several more times, eventually killing him. The name of that officer was not released. \n \n Security video from the adjacent Miami Herald building captured snippets of the violence as the two men \u0097 one dead, the other gravely injured and wearing only a shirt \u0097 lay on the sidewalk as officers arrived. . \n \n Days later, the chatter, theories and questions continued. The ghoulish event even spawned a Twitter account, dubbed The Miami Zombie. \n \n An emergency room doctor at Jackson Memorial Hospital said Eugene\u0092s attack could have been induced by bath salts, a drug nicknamed after the bathroom product it resembles. \n \n Police theorized earlier that it was \u0093cocaine psychosis,\u0094 a drug-induced craze that bakes the body internally and often leads those it affects to strip naked to try to cool off. \n \n Investigators asked any witnesses who have not stepped forward to call the Miami police homicide unit at 305-603-6350. \n \n Miami Herald writers Luisa Yanez and Daniela Guzman contributed to this report, which includes information from Miami Herald news partner WFOR CBS 4. ||||| MIAMI - \n \n Sources identified the man who was shot and killed by police while biting off parts of another man's face near Downtown Miami on Saturday. \n \n Police sources identified the man as Rudy Eugene. \n \n Police said Eugene, 31, was found attacking another man near the west end of the MacArthur Causeway and Biscayne Boulevard on Saturday afternoon. \n \n \"When the officer approached him, told him to stop, pointed a gun at him, he turned around and growled like a wild animal and kept eating at the man's face,\" Fraternal Order of Police President Armando Aguilar said Sunday. \n \n A witness said Eugene was biting off pieces of the other man's face and tossing them aside. He described it as looking like a scene out of The Walking Dead. \n \n Police then shot and killed Eugene after attempting to stop the assault. \n \n It's unclear what sparked the fight. \n \n Aguilar said Eugene had likely overdosed, citing four past instances in Miami-Dade County when people overdosed on a type of LSD, removed their clothes, and became violent. \n \n \"It causes them to go completely insane and become very violent,\" said Aguilar. \n \n The victim, a homeless man who frequents the same area where he was nearly killed, is listed in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital. \n \n Aguilar said 75 to 80 percent of the victim's face was missing. \n \n Both men have had prior run-ins with law enforcement. Miami-Dade court records for both show both men have been arrested for mostly a handful of misdemeanors. \n \n Who is Rudy Eugene? \n \n Eugene was previously married. He met his now ex-wife in high school at North Miami Beach Senior High. \n \n Their marriage was short-lived, lasting a year and a half. \n \n \"I wouldn't say he had mental problem but he always felt like people was against him type of attitude. No one was for him, everyone was against him,\" said Eugene's ex-wife. \n \n The two filed for divorce in 2007 during a violent point in their relationship. \n \n The woman told Local 10's Terrell Forney that Eugene became increasingly violent toward her. \n \n \"That's why I left,\" said Eugene's ex-wife. \n \n The two had not spoken in three or four years. \n \n A woman who answered the door at Eugene's former North Miami Beach home told Local 10 that the prior family had lost the 1-story house to foreclosure in 2011. \n \n However, Eugene would often pop up to the home unannounced, often looking for mail, which made the new family uncomfortable. \n \n \"He kind of looked weird a little bit but other than that I said as long as I've got bats and got the alarm system put up, I was okay,\" said the woman. \n \n The homeless, who camp near where it all happened, say they knew Eugene. They saw him frequently in that area walking around confused. \n \n \"I was actually talking to him the other day,\" one homeless man said. \"It's pretty weird.\"",

She's a medical epidemiologist in CDC's Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch. \n \n Even when lens-related eye infections are minor, they can still be painful and disruptive. \n \n For example, patients may have to make daily visits to an eye doctor or use eye drops every hour to treat the infection, Cope's team said. ||||| Contact lens wearers must be vigilant in taking proper care of their lenses in order to prevent infections, the CDC warns in a new report. \n \n About 41 million Americans wear contact lenses. While they are a safe and effective alternative to glasses, contact lenses can lead to serious problems if not handled properly. \n \n In fact, the CDC reports that nearly one in five lens-related eye infections reported to a federal database involved a patient who experienced eye damage. \n \n \u201cContact lenses are a safe and effective form of vision correction when worn and cared for as recommended,\u201d said Michael Beach, Ph.D., director of CDC\u2019s Healthy Water Program, in a statement. \u201cHowever, improper wear and care of contact lenses can cause eye infections that sometimes lead to serious, long-term damage.\u201d \n \n For the report, researchers reviewed more than 1,000 contact lens-related infections reported to the FDA between 2005 and 2015. \n \n The infections included patients who had a scarred cornea, needed a corneal transplant, or otherwise suffered a reduction in vision. \n \n More than 10 percent of the incidents involved a visit to an emergency department or urgent care clinic. The researchers point out that even minor damage can be painful and disrupt daily life. For example, many of the reports describe the patients needing to make daily visits to an eye doctor or hourly administration of eye drops to treat the infection. \n \n Furthermore, the report found that more than one in four of the reports mentioned easily avoidable behaviors that increase the risk of infection, such as wearing lenses while sleeping and wearing them longer than recommended. \n \n Experts urge that proper contact lens care is paramount to maintaining good eye health. \n \n \u201cWhile patients, especially younger patients, are really excited about being fitted with contact lenses, I stress to them that contact lenses are medical devices that have to be properly fitted, evaluated and that they must adhere to proper contact lens care,\u201d said Dr. Andrea Thau of the American Optometric Association (AOA). \u201cIf they don\u2019t follow my guidance, they can end up with serious eye problems.\u201d Thau was not involved in the CDC study. \n \n The AOA recommends the following tips to safely wear and care for contact lenses. \n \n Visit your eye doctor every year. Annual in-person eye examines determine whether or not your prescription changed and evaluate eye and overall health. An optometrist can diagnose eye diseases (such as glaucoma diabetes strokes \n \n Buy your contact lenses from a trusted source. Contact lenses and lens care products are medical devices regulated by the FDA, yet some online retailers sell them without prescriptions and sometimes ship contact lenses of the wrong prescription. Poorly fitted contact lenses can cause significant damage to the eye\u2019s function, which could lead to irreversible sight loss. \n \n Don\u2019t panic if your lens is \u201clost\u201d in your eye. Sometimes rubbing your eyes can cause a contact to move around, but it is not possible for it to get lost behind your eye due to a membrane \u2014 the conjunctiva \u2014 that covers the eye and the inside of the eyelids. If the lens has moved and is not visible, stay calm and instill a few drops of saline solution to moisten the eye, look away from where you feel the lens and lift your eyelid. When you see the lens, use the tip of your finger to remove the lens. If this happens repeatedly, make an appointment with your eye doctor to check the fit of your lenses. \n \n Don\u2019t ever share contacts. Sharing contacts means sharing germs and bacteria, which increases the risk of infection and complications. Additionally, friend\u2019s contacts may not be the right size or fit for your eyes leading to serious problems. \n \n Never use tap water to clean and rinse lenses. Contact solutions remove mucus, secretions, films or deposits that can build up during use and lead to bacterial growth if not removed properly. Use the disinfecting solution that your doctor prescribed each night to keep contacts clean and safe. When you find yourself at a last-minute overnight stay and don\u2019t have your solution, don\u2019t rely on tap water as it contains bacteria and other microorganisms that have been proven to cause serious eye infections. \n \n Keep your lens case clean. After you insert your reusable, disinfected contact lenses, rinse your case with solution, and store it upside down and open to dry fully. Every three months, toss your old case and replace it with a fresh, new one. \n \n No matter how tired you are, do not sleep in your contacts. While some lenses are approved for continuous overnight use, sleeping in lenses does increase the risk of an eye infection. If you regularly fall asleep with your lenses in, talk to your optometrist during your next appointment about extended wear contact lenses. ||||| This website is archived for historical purposes and is no longer being maintained or updated. \n \n Press Release Embargoed Until: Thursday, August 18, 2016, 1:00 p.m. ET \n \n Contact: Eye Wise: Contact Lenses 101 \n \n Entire infographic \n \n Nearly 1 in 5 contact lens-related eye infections reported to a federal database involved a patient who experienced eye damage, according to a report published in CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). \n \n The infections, submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Medical Device Report Database, included patients who had a scarred cornea, needed a corneal transplant, or otherwise suffered a reduction in vision.

The report reviewed 1,075 contact lens-related infections reported to FDA between 2005 and 2015. \n \n More than 10 percent of the reports indicated that the patient went to an emergency department or urgent care clinic for immediate care. Whether eye infections are minor or lead to long-lasting damage, they can be painful and disrupt daily life. For instance, the reports describe patients\u2019 daily visits to an eye doctor or hourly administration of eye drops to treat the infection. \n \n The MMWR was released in advance of Contact Lens Health Week, which runs August 22-26 and promotes healthy wear and care practices that can help contact lens wearers reduce their chances of getting an eye infection. Contact lens wearers can help prevent infections by properly using lenses and supplies and following directions on the lens labels. More than 1 out of 4 reports of infections mentioned easily avoidable behaviors that increase the chance of getting an eye infection, such as wearing contact lenses while sleeping and wearing them longer than recommended. \n \n \u201cAround 41 million people in the United States wear contact lenses and benefit from the improved vision and comfort they provide,\u201d said Jennifer Cope, M.D., M.P.H., medical epidemiologist in CDC\u2019s Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch. \u201cWhile people who get serious eye infections represent a small percentage of those who wear contacts, they serve as a reminder for all contact lens wearers to take simple steps to prevent infections.\u201d \n \n The findings in this report highlight the need for contact lens wearers to take good care of their lenses to help prevent contact lens-related eye infections. \n \n Three recommendations related to commonly reported and risky behaviors: \n \n Don\u2019t sleep in contact lenses without discussing with your eye doctor. Sleeping in contact lenses increases the chance of an eye infection by 6 to 8 times. Don\u2019t top off, or add new contact lens solution to old solution that has been sitting in the case. Adding new solution to used solution can lower germ-killing power. Replace your contact lenses as often as recommended by your eye doctor. People who do not replace their lenses as often as recommended have more complications and report more eye problems than those who follow the replacement recommendations. \n \n ### \n \n U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES",

    "document": "Donald Trump is the first major-party nominee whose basic motive is the subject of sincere curiosity. Every other figure who secured the nomination of one of the two main governing parties clearly did so as part of a plan to get elected president. It is possible that this is Trump\u2019s plan, too. But it\u2019s also possible that it\u2019s not, which is one of the things that makes his candidacy, or perhaps his \u201ccandidacy,\u201d so unusual. \n \n It is increasingly clear that Trump\u2019s actions are inconsistent with any rational plan to become president. He is unpopular on a scale that defies historical precedent, utterly loathed by overwhelming majorities. Some people believed Trump was merely playing the part of a right-wing provocateur in order to stand out from the field and win his party\u2019s nomination, and would \u201cpivot\u201d to the center afterward, but these hopes have been dashed. Trump has only become more hated. Nor is he doing basic tasks required of a nominee. When he was asked to call two dozen major Republican donors, Politico reports, Trump called three of them and then packed it in. \n \n It is entirely possible that Trump is simply in way over his head \u2014 he wants to be president but doesn\u2019t know how to go about it, and he trusts his own instincts far too much. The alternate possibility is that he has a different motive. In this scenario, Trump is not completely incompetent, but is shrewdly, or at least rationally, following a plan to enrich or otherwise gratify himself. The trouble has always been discerning what such a plan could be. \n \n Trump\u2019s campaign has not helped his branding business. To the contrary, it seems to be doing enormous damage. He has lost clients already, and will probably continue to do so. If your last name is synonymous with racism and misogyny, you can\u2019t sell your name to golf courses and restaurants, which have dropped him left and right. Being adored by 30 percent of the country and hated by the rest is a recipe unsuited either for winning nationwide office or selling consumer products. \n \n What it could well be is a plan to launch an independent media organ. Sarah Ellison reports that Trump is exploring the possibility of a television or other media venture that would cater to his loyalists. \u201cAccording to several people briefed on the discussions, the presumptive Republican nominee is examining the opportunity presented by the \u2018audience\u2019 currently supporting him,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe has also discussed the possibility of launching a 'mini-media conglomerate' outside of his existing TV-production business, Trump Productions LLC.\u201d According to Ellison, Trump chafes at the way media have been able to make money off his antics without him getting a cut \u2014 a piece of reporting that happens to comport with Trump\u2019s frequent public boasts about the ratings he commands and the money others are making off him. \n \n And if this is Trump\u2019s plan, it makes sense. Perhaps he grasps a truth the official Republican Party has refused to acknowledge: The conservative base is a subculture. It is a numerically large subculture, but a subculture nonetheless. It rejects the moral values of the larger society and wallows within its own imaginary world, in which Barack Obama is a foreign-born agent of anti-American interests, global warming is a lie concocted by greedy scientists or perhaps the Chinese, and hordes of foreigners are rendering the United States unrecognizable. The greater the gulf between the reality perceived by Trump\u2019s supporters and the reality experienced by the rest of the world, the worse for the Republican Party, but all the more profitable for the media that can cater to their delusions. Figures like Rupert Murdoch, Ann Coulter, and Rush Limbaugh have grown rich doing so. Trump may have figured out that there\u2019s no reason he should work for them when he can cut out the middleman. ||||| Every election cycle has its own breakout media star. In 1992, it was CNN. A few years later, it would be an e-mail blast called the Drudge Report. By 2000, the country had more or less been neatly delineated between MSNBC and Fox News households. The 2008 election introduced Politico and the Huffington Post to the adults\u2019 table. BuzzFeed joined in 2012. \n \n The breakout media star of 2016 is, inarguably, Donald Trump, who has masterfully\u2014and horrifyingly\u2014demonstrated an aptitude for manipulating the news cycle, gaining billions of dollars worth of free airtime, and dominating coverage on every screen. Now, several people around him are looking for a way to leverage his supporters into a new media platform and cable channel. \n \n Trump is indeed considering creating his own media business, built on the audience that has supported him thus far in his bid to become the next president of the United States. According to several people briefed on the discussions, the presumptive Republican nominee is examining the opportunity presented by the \u201caudience\u201d currently supporting him. He has also discussed the possibility of launching a \u201cmini-media conglomerate\u201d outside of his existing TV-production business, Trump Productions LLC. He has, according to one of these people, enlisted the consultation of his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who owns the The New York Observer. Trump\u2019s rationale, according to this person, is that, \u201cwin or lose, we are onto something here. We\u2019ve triggered a base of the population that hasn\u2019t had a voice in a long time.\u201d For his part, Kushner was heard at a New York dinner party saying that \u201cthe people here don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m seeing. You go to these arenas and people go crazy for him.\u201d (Both Kushner and Ivanka Trump did not respond to a request for comment.) \n \n \u201cEven old Fox News didn\u2019t have the right read on what the base is. And we do.\u201d \n \n Trump, this person close to the matter suggests, has become irked by his ability to create revenue for other media organizations without being able to take a cut himself. Such a situation \u201cbrings him to the conclusion that he has the business acumen and the ratings for his own network.\u201d Trump has \u201cgotten the bug,\u201d according to this person. \u201cSo now he wants to figure out if he can monetize it.\u201d \n \n Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, adamantly denied that such conversations have occurred. (\u201cThere is absolutely no truth to this whatsoever,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t been even uttered. Not even thought about.\u201d) Then, after conferring with Trump, she issued a subsequent statement clarifying her point: \u201cWhile it\u2019s true Mr. Trump garners exceptionally high ratings, there are absolutely no plans or discussions taking place regarding a venture of this nature.\u201d Meanwhile, someone close to Kushner has suggested that Trump would be unlikely to go so far as to seek out a partner at this stage of the race, given that it might risk alienating many of the established media players that he has outflanked\u2014and that he is relying on to get him elected. (Such a move would also inevitably raise issues regarding the F.C.C.\u2019s \u201cequal-time\u201d rule.) Nevertheless, shortly after my correspondence with Hicks, he tweeted out: \u201cThe press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!\u201d \n \n Indeed, the specter of a Trump-focused platform, no matter how unappetizing, is not entirely illogical. Republican candidates have historically used the protracted national election cycle to indirectly land gigs on Fox News or Sirius XM. Election cycles have become veritable job interviews for the likes of Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, and others. But Trump has successfully circumnavigated traditional media outlets more than any candidate in history. He has picked fights with Fox News and won. His campaign has barred reporters from the Huffington Post, Gawker, Buzzfeed, and the New Hampshire Union Leader from events. Earlier this month, a Politico reporter was denied access to an event in California. After The Washington Post reported on Trump\u2019s suggestion that President Obama was somehow complicit in the Orlando terrorist attack, his campaign revoked the news organization\u2019s press credentials. \n \n A generation ago\u2014perhaps even a few months ago\u2014these tactics would have irreparably doomed a campaign. But Trump has proved that he no longer needs the platform that news outlets have traditionally provided for candidates. As my colleague Nick Bilton has noted, Trump has mastered the attention war on social media and discovered a preternatural ability to tap into his base directly. Love him or despise him, Trump indisputably has the finger on the pulse of his audience. And this connection could certainly facilitate such a hypothetical mini-media conglomerate. \u201cEven old Fox News didn\u2019t have the right read on what the base is,\u201d one person briefed on the conversation told me. \u201cAnd we do.\u201d ||||| The Associated Press is reporting that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria crystallized during a December 14 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to the news agency, the decision was \u201cmade hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.\u201d \n \n One of the surprising details of the report is that Erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing Trump on the Syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the Trump administration had reached, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, was that Trump would tell Erdogan to back off from his threats to attack Kurdish forces in Syria. \n \n But during the phone conversation, Trump threw away the script and agreed with his Turkish counterpart. As AP relates, Trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred: \n \n Erdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants. \n \n Trump then posed Erdogan\u2019s question to his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was participating in the phone call. Bolton admitted that the Islamic State had indeed lost 99 per cent of its territory but said that it was in America\u2019s interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence. \n \n Trump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said. \n \n From this reporting, it seems likely that it was never Erdogan\u2019s intention to get the United States to withdraw. Rather he made the demand as a bargaining move, to get other, lesser goals. Trump, displaying his mastery of the art of the deal, gave in to Erdogan\u2019s maximum position. \n \n The White House denies the accuracy of AP\u2019s account. ||||| A charismatic, \u00fcber-rich New York businessman and celebrity, derided by his political opponents as a con man and \u201ccrypto-fascist clown,\u201d embarks on his first run for elected office. He electrifies his die-hard conservative followers with appeals to patriotism, family values, pride and wealth acquisition and a pledge to restore the promise of America. \n \n What sounds uncannily like the narrative behind Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 run for the U.S. presidency is in fact the plot of Bob Roberts, the 1992 political mockumentary about a crusading Pennsylvania Senate candidate and self-made millionaire/folk musician (played by Tim Robbins, who also wrote the screenplay and directed). Bob Roberts may not stand under a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d banner, but the conservative rebel\u2019s \u201cTimes Are Changin\u2019 Back\u201d outlook and album title managed to preview both the culture wars of the 1990s and the Trump phenomenon of the current election cycle. \n \n Roberts is a brilliant manipulator of the media who is not shy about trumpeting his own wealth. \n \n Roberts is \u201chandsome, meticulously dressed and groomed,\u201d according to the screenplay. \u201cHe is the quintessential yuppie but there is also something intimidating about him.\u201d A military school grad with an Ivy League degree, he is a slick businessman whose campaign bus and staff double as a mobile trading unit. Not unlike the current Republican front-runner, Roberts is a brilliant manipulator of the media who is not shy about trumpeting his own wealth and the importance of winning. \n \n Set during the 1990 election cycle, the film traverses a very different political landscape from today, from concerns with drugs and Contras to the threat of Saddam Hussein, as it follows Roberts along the campaign trail. But Roberts\u2019 brand of \u201cdown-home fascism,\u201d as critic Roger Ebert labeled it, transcends the era. It is a populism grounded in division, and the faux folk anthems that the guitar-strumming Roberts sings at his massive campaign rallies are hymns to greed (\u201cI will take my inheritance and invest it with pride\u201d) and diatribes against political correctness, Arabs and \u201clazy people\u201d who \u201ccomplain and complain and complain\u201d about their lot in life. \u201cI wanna be rich, I don\u2019t have a brain / So give me a handout while I complain,\u201d goes one of the catchy songs written by Robbins and his older brother, David (their father was folk singer Gil Robbins of the Highwaymen). \n \n As Roberts\u2019 election fortunes begin to soar, the dynamic surrounding his campaign turns increasingly ugly. Protesters attending his rallies are roughed up as he aggressively calls them out from the stage. The film even captures how his somewhat sinister celebrity grates on many of the journalists and entertainers who have no choice but to go along with it. \u201cIt seems you would like Americans to cast their vote based on hatred and ignorance,\u201d says one TV newswoman who can barely hide her contempt for the man she later confides to the camera \u201chas adopted the persona and the mindset of the free-thinking rebel and turned it on itself.\u201d The controversy surrounding Roberts\u2019 guest appearance on a fictional version of Saturday Night Live mirrors many of the misgivings surrounding Trump\u2019s hosting of SNL in November. Unlike with Trump, however, an angry staffer pulls the plug (literally) on Roberts\u2019 performance. \n \n Bob Roberts is not a subtle film in either its plot or its caricature of far-right politics, and, in the end, it collapses under its own pretenses and far-fetched conspiracies as its Machiavellian protagonist engages in the ultimate deception to win voter sympathy \u2014 and a Senate seat. Still, like every shrewd political satire, it nails its mark enough to remain relevant, even while verging on the ridiculous. \u201cRecent events haven\u2019t completely overtaken the movie,\u201d The New York Times wrote of the film\u2019s opening in the midst of the turbulent 1992 presidential election, \u201cbut they do indicate just how wild a satire must be these days to remain on the cutting edge of the outrageous.\u201d \n \n Even in this 2016 election, where the outrageous \u2014 and the level of outrage \u2014 have reached new heights, Bob Roberts still strikes a powerful chord among those who complain and complain and complain about the state of American politics.",

The sources say that during the call, Erdogan put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for US troops to be in Syria was to defeat the ISIS group. \"Why are you still there?\" the second official said Erdogan asked, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining ISIS militants. Trump then posed Erdogan's question to his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was participating in the phone call. Bolton admitted that the ISIS had indeed lost 99% of its territory but said that it was in America's interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence. Trump was not dissuaded, the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, \u2013 A senior Turkish official says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded that the US withdraw its troops from Syria in a phone call with President Trump last month, the AP reports. The official, speaking under condition of anonymity, says Erdogan told Trump he wanted the US to end its involvement in Syria, which he blames for the failed coup of his ally the Kurdistan Workers' Party. The US has about 2,000 troops in Syria to help defeat the Islamic State, and the official says Erdogan's demand that they withdraw was the main point of discussion during their call. Turkey has long complained that its own troops are being targeted by the US in Syria.

(Associated Press) \n \n FILE - In this Jan. 31, 2014 file photo Amanda Knox prepares to leave the set following a television interview, in New York. The founder of a heavily visited Wiki site about the prosecutions of U.S. star... (Associated Press) \n \n Here is a look at the case, the possible outcomes and issues that might come into play. \n \n THE CASE: \n \n Meredith Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Britain, was found dead Nov. 2, 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox in the Umbrian city of Perugia where both women were studying. Kercher's throat was slashed and she had been sexually assaulted. \n \n Knox, now 27, and Raffaele Sollecito, who turns 31 on Thursday, were convicted of the murder by a trial court in Perugia in 2009. They were freed in 2011 after a Perugia appellate court overturned the convictions. They found themselves back in an appellate court after the Court of Cassation vacated the acquittals in 2013 in a harsh rebuke of the Perugia chief appellate judge's reasoning. \n \n Last year, an appeals court in Florence convicted the pair, sentencing Knox to 28 \u00bd years and Sollecito to 25 years. The court ruled that the pair acted in concert with Rudy Hermann Guede, a drifter born in the Ivory Coast who is serving a 16-year sentence for his role in the murder. \n \n Knox, who spent nearly four years in jail during the investigation and after her lower court conviction, remains free in the United States. She has vowed never to return willingly to Italy. \n \n IF THE CONVICTION IS CONFIRMED: \n \n If the high court upholds the Florence convictions, the prosecutor's office in Florence would issue an order to execute the sentences. In the case of Sollecito, who has remained in Italy, police would seek to take him into custody immediately after receiving the order. For Knox, the situation is more complicated. The prosecutor would ask the Justice Ministry to seek her extradition, and the Justice Ministry must decide whether to comply. \n \n Italy and the United States have an extradition treaty, and there is no formal reason for the request not to be made, according to Andrea Scella, a professor of criminal law and process at the University of Udine. However, extradition retains a political element, and the government could decide not to advance a request, accepting any political consequences from the Parliament or voters, he said. \n \n Issues like the severity of the crime and the length of the penalty influence extradition requests. Italy's request could propose having Knox serve the sentence in the United States, as an alternative. \n \n The timing of Italy's request is uncertain, but could unfold over months or longer. \n \n IF THE HIGH COURT ORDERS A NEW TRIAL: \n \n The high court can throw out all or any part of the Florence appeals court guilty verdict and order yet another appeals trial \u2014 the third in this case. It is not unprecedented in Italy for a case to be sent back to for multiple appellate rounds. In fact, one case involving the 1972 murder of a police commissioner reached the Court of Cassation nine times before the verdicts were finalized, 28 years after the murder. \n \n No appellate trial date can be set until the reasoning for the court's decision is issued, which would contain very specific directions to the new appeals court on which elements of the case needed to be re-examined. The court has 90 days to issue its reasoning. \n \n IF THE COURT ACQUITS: \n \n The high court can throw out the guilty verdict without ordering a new trial, which is tantamount to acquittal. Such a decision is rare, experts say, and would require the court to give a full reasoning for its decision \u2014 also within 90 days. \n \n For Knox and Sollecito, it would be \"case closed\" for their criminal court proceedings. Knox would be able to travel to Europe and Italy without risk of arrest. Sollecito, whose passport has been seized, would have his freedom to travel restored. \n \n THE ROGUE JUROR'S INTERVIEW: \n \n One of the civilian jurors on the panel that convicted the pair in the Florence appellate case gave an interview last week to the magazine Oggi saying she believed there was not enough evidence \"to justify such a severe conviction.\" The interview, which violates secrecy of the deliberations, appeared to confirm rumors that the guilty finding was not unanimous. However, unanimous decisions are not required and it is unlikely to be mentioned in any of the legal teams' arguments before the high court nor have any bearing on the decision.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Yet another ruling in the Amanda Knox case is coming from Italy's highest court today. Knox and then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted in the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher in 2009, acquitted on appeal in 2011 (at which point Knox returned to the US), had that acquittal overturned in 2013, and were then found guilty again last year. As the New York Times and the AP report, Italy's top court, the Court of Cassation, has a number of options: Confirm the convictions: That would mean Italy would likely attempt to extradite Knox, who has maintained her innocence and vowed not to return to the country willingly, though there is a chance the Justice Ministry would decline to do so. Sollecito, who is still in Italy, would go to prison immediately to serve his sentence. Order new appellate trials for Knox and/or Sollecito: Yes, you read that right: This saga may still not be over. If this court decides to throw out all or part of the appeals court's guilty verdict, it will likely order a third trial. (To give you an idea of how long this could go on, one 1972 murder case went to the Court of Cassation nine times before a final verdict was issued, 28 years later.) Throw out the guilty verdict without ordering new trials: This would amount to an acquittal, leaving Knox free to visit Italy without fear of arrest, but the AP notes that \"such a decision is rare.\" If an extradition request is made for Knox, a professor of international law tells the Times the US will likely grant it, though it would be a \"hard\" decision. The two countries do have an extradition treaty, and another expert tells the AP there is no formal reason\u2014though there are a number of political ones\u2014for Italy to not bother asking in the first place. (Some have argued the concept of \"double jeopardy\" could be used to block Knox's extradition, though others have debunked that idea.) It's not clear when the ruling is expected, but the BBC's live updates noted that the hearing was \"underway\" as of 7am Eastern time.",

    "document": "The Trump administration is trying to force Twitter to unmask at least one anti-Trump account, according to a new lawsuit. \n \n Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) filed a lawsuit Thursday against the U.S. government to block a request to provide personal information about the user behind @ALT_uscis. \n \n The account, whose name stands for alternative U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is one of several alternative government accounts created after President Trump took office. It currently has more than 40,000 followers. \n \n According to the lawsuit, an agent with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faxed a summons to Twitter last month requesting the user's account login, phone number, mailing address and IP address. \n \n Twitter argues in the suit that the request is a threat to free speech, which includes \"a right to disseminate such anonymous or pseudonymous political speech.\" \n \n Related: The Twitter resistance: Fighting Trump one tweet at a time \n \n Twitter declined to comment beyond the legal filing. A representative for the CBP said it does not comment on pending litigation. A representative for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n Shortly after Trump's inauguration, alternative or \"rogue\" Twitter accounts began popping up for the National Park Service, Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and more. The accounts claimed to represent the views of government staffers who opposed Trump's policies. \n \n In addition to criticizing the Trump administration, the @ALT_uscis account claimed to reveal improprieties with the CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n \n \"There are ICE people in middle America who make twice their federal salary by 'real honest ways' to look the other way,\" the account wrote in one tweet in February. \n \n That was followed up by a comment that \"jackpot\" for the enforcement agencies is \"when they catch a deportable with a damn debit card on, they love the prepaid ones!

The account also posted a screengrab of the First Amendment and later joked, \"This is one way to get verified.\" ||||| Twitter has launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration, after the Department of Homeland Security sought to unmask an anonymous user of an anti-Trump account. \n \n According to Twitter\u2019s suit, filed today in Northern California District Court, US Customs and Border Protection has attempted to use a \u201climited-purpose investigatory tool\u201d to unmask the owner of the Twitter account \u201c@ALT_uscis.\u201d The account, one of several \u201calt\u201d or \u201crogue\u201d government accounts that appeared in the wake of Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency, was used \u201cto express public criticism of the Department and the current Administration,\u201d according to Twitter\u2019s complaint. \n \n In the suit, Twitter writes that @ALT_uscis has purported to be a dissenting member of US Citizenship and Immigration Services. On March 14th, Twitter received a summons from Customs requesting records that could reveal the identity of the account\u2019s operator, including IP logs and any associated phone number or mailing address. Twitter writes that it later informed the account holder of the summons, and told the agency of its intent to fight the order in court. \n \n \u201ca grave chilling effect on the speech of that account\u201d \n \n In addition to the Department of Homeland Security and its subagency, the lawsuit names four individuals as defendants: DHS secretary John Kelly, acting CBP commissioner Kevin McAleenan, and special agents Stephen P. Caruso and Adam Hoffman, who issued and served the order itself. \n \n Twitter\u2019s lawsuit focuses on whether Customs has the legal authority to make such a request. CBP\u2019s initial order invoked a statute largely related to taxes on the importation of merchandise into the US, which Twitter argues is insufficient authority to unmask a user. Twitter also writes that unmasking the account \u201cwould have a grave chilling effect on the speech of that account in particular and on the many other \u2018alternative agency\u2019 accounts that have been created to voice dissent to government policies.\u201d Unmasking the account, the company contends, would infringe on political speech protected by Supreme Court rulings. The ACLU has pledged to support Twitter in the case. \n \n Twitter declined to comment on the suit. Shortly after news of the lawsuit broke, the account @ALT_uscis responded with the following tweet. \n \n @ALT_uscis is one of a string of accounts claiming to be operated by rogue government employees, formed in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. It\u2019s unclear whether any of the accounts are authentic \u2014 including @ALT_uscis \u2014 although many purport to offer an insider perspective. The Trump administration has responded aggressively to leaks in the past, including on-the-spot phone checks of White House staffers suspected of sharing information with the press. \n \n The order served to Twitter is embedded below. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Thursday filed a federal lawsuit to block an order by the U.S. government demanding that it reveal who is behind an account opposed to President Donald Trump\u2019s tough immigration policies. \n \n Twitter cited freedom of speech as a basis for not turning over records about the account, @ALT_uscis. The account is claimed to be the work of at least one federal immigration employee, according to the lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court. \n \n The acronym U.S. CIS refers to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the account describes itself as \u201cimmigration resistance.\u201d Trump has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and has promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants. \n \n Following Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, anonymous Twitter feeds that borrowed the names and logos of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies appeared to challenge the president\u2019s views on climate change and other issues. They called themselves \u201calt\u201d accounts. \n \n Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio declined to comment on whether the government had demanded information about other accounts critical of Trump. \n \n Twitter, which counts Trump among its active users, has a record of litigating in favor of user privacy. \n \n \"The rights of free speech afforded Twitter's users and Twitter itself under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution include a right to disseminate such anonymous or pseudonymous political speech,\" Twitter said in the lawsuit. (tmsnrt.rs/2p6CnXp) \n \n The Department of Homeland Security, which is a defendant in the lawsuit, declined to comment on pending litigation. The Justice Department, which typically represents federal agencies in court, and the White House had no immediate comment. \n \n Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said in a statement it was a waste of resources to try to uncover an anonymous critic, and he called on the Homeland Security inspector general to investigate who directed the \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d \n \n Esha Bhandari, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Twitter user, said the government\u2019s request was highly unusual. Requests for social media account information from the U.S. government typically involve national security or criminal charges, she said. \n \n Related Coverage Twitter revels in role of free speech defender as it sues Trump administration \n \n \u201cWe have seen no reason the government has given for seeking to unmask this speaker\u2019s identity,\u201d Bhandari said, adding that the right to anonymous speech against the government is \u201ca bedrock American value\u201d strongly protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n \n Shortly after the lawsuit became public, @ALT_uscis tweeted a copy of the First Amendment and a picture of part of the lawsuit. The account\u2019s followers nearly tripled to 89,000 in the hours after the news broke. \n \n For weeks the account has posted criticism of the administration. It tweeted a parody of the game \u201cbingo\u201d for \u201cright-wing idiots,\u201d said that some anti-immigration advocates must have been dropped on their head at birth, and mocked Trump for not giving more of his wealth to charities. \n \n Twitter said it received an administrative summons last month demanding that it provide records related to the account. (tmsnrt.rs/2oKlWnk) \n \n A copy of the summons filed with the lawsuit says the records are needed for an investigation to ensure compliance with duties, taxes and fines and other customs and immigration matters. \n \n It was not immediately clear how the anonymous account fit into those laws and regulations, and Twitter said the summons was an abuse of a law meant to be used to investigate imported merchandise. \n \n Twitter might have a strong case that the summons was improper, said Paul Alan Levy, staff attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group who specializes in online privacy and free speech issues. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any way for the government to come out of this looking good,\u201d Levy said. \n \n There is no indication that the White House was aware of the summons, which was signed by a Florida-based supervisor who works in an office that investigates employee corruption, misconduct and mismanagement. The supervisor could not be reached for comment. \n \n The summons requested, but apparently did not order, that Twitter keep the document private. \n \n The logo for the parody immigration Twitter account @alt_uscis. @alt_uscis/Handout via Reuters \n \n The social media company has a history of challenging government demands for information on its users, including a 2012 demand from New York prosecutors about an Occupy Wall Street protester. In that case, Twitter was forced to hand over tweets from the protester to a judge who threatened the company with sanctions, and the protester pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. \n \n Twitter sued the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014, seeking permission to publicly disclose more information about requests it gets from U.S. authorities for information about its users. The lawsuit was partly dismissed last year. \n \n Among the lawyers representing Twitter in the latest case is Seth Waxman, a former high-ranking Justice Department official under President Bill Clinton.",

He asked supporters to be quiet, saying: \u201cThis is a court, not a theatre.\u201d \n \n In his judgment, Burnett said: \u201cIt would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences alleged against him. Far from it. Much of Mr Love\u2019s argument was based on the contention that this is indeed where he should be prosecuted. \n \n \u201cThe CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] must now bend its endeavours to his prosecution, with the assistance to be expected from the authorities in the United States, recognising the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims.\u201d \n \n The court heard evidence from psychiatrists who work in the US prison system and questioned the adequacy of safeguarding procedures in US prisons. \n \n \n \n The CPS, which acts on behalf of the US authorities in the case, said it would read the judgment before deciding whether or not to appeal. It has 14 days to decide whether or not to appeal to the supreme court. \n \n Emerging from the front of the court afterwards, Love said: \u201cThis is not just for myself. I hope this sets a precedent for the future for anyone in the same position that they will be tried here.\u201d \n \n At a press conference later, he added: \u201cI am greatly relieved that I\u2019m no longer facing the prospect of being locked up in a country I have never visited. This legal struggle has defined my life for the past four years. I\u2019m not looking forward to be being prosecuted but I think there\u2019s a better chance that it will be done justly and fairly in the UK.\u201d \n \n Keyboard warrior: the British hacker fighting for his life Read more \n \n Love, who holds joint British and Finnish nationality, has Asperger syndrome and severe depression.

This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it\u2019s shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal.\u201d \n \n His father, the Rev Alexander Love, had said his son feared for his life because he did not think he could cope with the trauma of being sent to the US. He also praised Theresa May for devising the legal test that prevented Love\u2019s removal. \n \n \n \n Nick Vamos, a solicitor at the law firm Peters and Peters and a former CPS extradition specialist, said: \u201cThis judgment will mean that US and UK prosecutors will need to be very careful in future about how they decide who should prosecute cases of concurrent jurisdiction, and will have to focus far more than previously on a suspect\u2019s connections to the UK.\u201d \n \n ||||| Lauri Love smiles as he leaves with parents Alexander Love, left, Sirkka-Liisa Love, second left, and girlfriend Sylvia Mann, from The Royal Courts of Justice in London, Monday, Feb. 5, 2018.

The ruling in Lauri Love's appeal against extradition to the United States, where he faced solitary confinement... (Associated Press) \n \n LONDON (AP) \u2014 An alleged computer hacker from Britain won his appeal Monday against extradition to the United States. \n \n The High Court in London ruled that Lauri Love's extradition wouldn't be allowed, although judges said it would still be possible to prosecute him in England. \n \n The decision in Love's favor was greeted with cheers in the courtroom. \n \n U.S. officials had requested Love's extradition on cyber-hacking charges for allegedly compromising government networks between October 2012 and October 2013 and stealing data. \n \n Love, 32, has Asperger's syndrome and a depressive illness. His lawyers said it would be \"unjust and oppressive\" to send him to the U.S. to face trial. \n \n He said outside the courthouse he hopes his case can help spur discussion about how people with mental health issues are handled by the justice system. \n \n \"This decision is important for the appropriate administration of criminal justice and also for the humanitarian accommodation of people whose brains work differently,\" he said. \n \n He criticized prosecutors for suggesting his mental issues were fabricated, saying that only served to stigmatize people with similar problems. \n \n Love is alleged to have stolen large quantities of data from various American agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Federal Reserve and NASA, and the U.S. Army. \n \n He has been charged in three U.S. states: New Jersey, New York and Virginia. \n \n At a hearing in November, his legal team said there was a high risk that Love would kill himself if extradited. \n \n In their ruling, the High Court judges raised the possibility that Love could be put on trial in England, saying that that wouldn't be considered \"oppressive\" and that he would be much less of a suicide risk if imprisoned in England because he would be close to his family and loves ones. \n \n The judges said the Crown Prosecution Service \"must now bend its endeavors to his prosecution, with the assistance to be expected from the authorities in the United States, recognizing the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims.\" \n \n Prosecutors haven't indicated whether charges will be brought against Love in Britain. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lauri Love: Alleged hacker hopes extradition case 'sets a precedent' \n \n Alleged computer hacker Lauri Love has won his High Court appeal against his extradition to the US. \n \n Mr Love, 33, from Stradishall, Suffolk, was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of hacking into FBI, US Central Bank and Nasa systems. \n \n Appeal judges said extradition would be \"oppressive by reason of his physical and mental condition\". \n \n They urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to prosecute Mr Love, who has Aspergers syndrome, in England. \n \n Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley said Mr Love, who also has depression, \"did not seek impunity for the acts alleged against him, but contended that he should be tried and, if convicted, sentenced in the United Kingdom\". \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Lauri Love attended the appeal hearing with his girlfriend Sylvia Mann \n \n They said: \"We accept that the evidence shows that the fact of extradition would bring on severe depression, and that Mr Love would probably be determined to commit suicide, here or in America.\" \n \n Mr Love is alleged to have stolen huge amounts of data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US army, the defence department, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. \n \n However, his supporters had warned if he was extradited there was a \"high risk\" he would kill himself. \n \n The judges urged the Crown Prosecution Service to work with US authorities because of \"the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims\". \n \n They added that \"if proven, these are serious offences indeed\". \n \n The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court. \n \n Lauri Love case timeline \n \n Image copyright PA \n \n 28 October 2013: Lauri Love is arrested in Suffolk under the Computer Misuse Act and accused of breaching the security of Nasa and FBI, among other US government agencies.

In a central London court decision, the judges ruled Love should stay in the UK. \n \n In their full judgement, the lord chief justice Ian Burnett and justice Duncan Ouseley discharged Love's order for extradition. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The judges ruled that Love's extradition would be \"oppressive\" due to his health conditions and it would be likely that he would be kept in solitary confinement in the US prison system. The new decision by the judges overrules Westminster Magistrates' court in late 2016, which said Love should go to the US. \n \n Love, who lives near Newmarket, is accused of hacking US government bodies and intelligence agencies in 2012 and 2013. He could have faced up to 99 years in prison and a potential fine of up to $9 million (\u00a36.3m) if he was extradited. \n \n Read next Friday briefing: Details of 150 million MyFitnessPal accounts stolen in breach Friday briefing: Details of 150 million MyFitnessPal accounts stolen in breach \n \n However, Love lives with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and has a history of depression, and has argued his medical situation means he shouldn't be extradited to the US to face any potential trial. Love has publicly stated he would take his own life if he was forced to go abroad. His legal team has argued he should face trial in the UK instead of being extradited. \n \n \"The support of his family, in particular, would mean that he would be at far lower a risk of suicide,\" if he was to stay in the UK, the judges said. Their ruling continued to say that there is \"no satisfactory and sufficiently specific evidence\" that treatments would be available in the US for Love. \n \n Despite the ruling, the judges said the UK's Crown Prosecution Service should \"bend its endeavours\" to prosecute Love over the charges he faces. Any potential prosecution should be done in accordance with US authorities. \"If proven, these are serious offences indeed,\" the ruling says. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Police working for the National Crime Agency first arrested Love, in Suffolk, in 2013. He was not charged until 2015 when he was arrested on behalf of the US government and faced with the threat of extradition. \n \n Upon hearing the decision campaign group Liberty said it is important that a vulnerable person like Love should face trial where a possible criminal offence was committed. \"We are delighted that the court has today recognised Lauri\u2019s vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him,\" Emma Norton the head of legal casework said. \n \n Read next Pro-life bots and trolls are gearing up to sway Ireland's abortion vote Pro-life bots and trolls are gearing up to sway Ireland's abortion vote \n \n \"This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it's shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal.\u201d \n \n After the ruling, Love spoke outside the court. \"I'm very thankful for all of the support that we've had, without which I don't think I would have made it this far.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"This decision obviously affects my life but the reason I have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country I have never visited,\" he said. \"But it is to set a precedent whereby this will not happen to other people in the future, if there is suspected criminality then it will be trialled here in the UK. We're hopeful that other people may be able to rely on this verdict to ensure they're more humanely treated by the justice services.\" \n \n Here's the background to Love's case. \n \n What's he charged with? \n \n It's alleged that Love was involved in #OpLastResort, run by hacking group Anonymous. The operation was a protest against the arrest of renowned programmer Aaron Swartz. (Swartz killed himself while facing charges in 2013). \n \n Read next Against a torrent of digital abuse, women are taking back control Against a torrent of digital abuse, women are taking back control \n \n Between 2012 and 2013 it is said Love belong to an Anonymous group accused of hacking into Nasa, the FBI and US Federal Reserve. A 2014 FBI legal filing says Love is allegedly a \"sophisticated hacker\" who stole sensitive personal information and made it available online. \n \n The FBI says an SQL injection was used to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion and backdoors were inserted into the websites that could be exploited in the future. The website of the United States Sentencing Commission was also defaced and hosted a video created by Anonymous. \n \n Love has neither confirmed or denied any role in Operation Last Resort, as The Guardian reported in September 2017. \n \n Before this, in October 2013, the National Crime Agency arrested Love after pretending to deliver him a parcel at his parent's home. The body later issued legal proceedings telling Love to hand over passwords to his encrypted laptop but courts ruled this would not be legal and denied the NCA's request. No charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). \n \n The legal arguments \n \n The court case Love v Government of the United States of America \u2013 which is being ruled on today \u2013 was held in the Royal Courts of Justice in November last year. The appeal was took to court by Love after he lost a court case for extradition in 2016. \n \n Read next A cyberattack on Russia wouldn't be a good move for the UK A cyberattack on Russia wouldn't be a good move for the UK \n \n In the case three months ago, Love's legal team, led by Edward Fitzgerald QC, argued that Love should not be tried in the US because of his medical conditions. \"There\u2019s a very real risk that he would commit suicide,\" The Guardian reported at the time. \"There\u2019s a virtual certainty that his condition would deteriorate.\" \n \n It was argued the stress of being removed from his family and routine would exacerbate his conditions. Fitzgerald said the case against Love could be held in the UK and there would be a \"real risk of inhuman treatment\" against Love if he was sent to the US. \n \n Judge Nina Tempia, at Westminster Magistrates' court, ruled in September 2016 (court documents) that Love should be extradited to the US. She said: there is a \"strong public interest\" in the UK upholding its extradition treaties with the US; the offences are serious; \"millions of dollars' worth of damage\" was caused by the hacks; that US officials say they can manage vulnerable people in their prison system. \n \n However Tempia's ruling said Love is \"at high risk of committing suicide\" if extradited and he is \"of good character\" and is working and studying. \n \n Ultimately, it was decided that he should be extradited as Tempia was \"satisfied his needs will be comprehensively met by the US authorities\". Two months later, in November 2016, home secretary Amber Rudd signed an order that Love should be extradited. His appeal was then launched. \n \n The change in the law \n \n Love's case has many similarities with that of hacker Gary McKinnon. In October 2012, Theresa May \u2013 the then home secretary \u2013 blocked the extradition of McKinnon to the US after a 10 year battle. He faced up to 60 years in US jail if convicted of hacking charges. \n \n Advertisement \n \n McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome and suffered with depression, was allowed to stay in the UK after it was found his condition would \"give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life\" that it would breach his human rights. \n \n May also introduced a forum bar. \"This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so,\" she said at the time. \n \n The forum bar exists under section 83A of the Extradition Act 20013. It allows judges to block extradition to the US and other countries if a crime was committed in the UK and if it is in the accused's interests to stand trial in the UK. Essentially, the addition to the law ensured that government ministers would not have to make any final decisions on an extradition case when it comes to human rights grounds. Speaking ahead of Love's trial one of his lawyers, Karen Todner, said if the forum bar is successful \"the UK police will have a green light to take more prosecutions here and not bow to the US pressure to extradite\".",

The High Court of London decided against extradition on Monday, with the Guardian reporting that it agreed with the two arguments his lawyers put forth as part of Love's appeal against extradition: That he could be prosecuted in the UK, and that Love, who has Asperger's and depression, could end up killing himself while in US custody. The AP reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in England, where family and friends would be accessible to him.

I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way.\" Wired notes that Love would have faced up to 99 years and a fine of up to $9 million were he convicted in US courts.

    "document": "Texas Professor Warns That Guns in Classrooms Could Dumb Down Provocative Lessons Lisa Moore teaches gay and lesbian studies at the University of Texas, where she is a founder of Gun-Free UT. \"Shutting down dissent and free speech,\" she says, \"is the opposite of what should happen on a college campus.\" \n \n On Thursday, around the time a mass shooting was unfolding at a small community college in Oregon, Lisa Moore, an English professor at the University of Texas, was leading a protest against guns on campus. She\u2019s one of the founders of Gun Free UT, a group that sprang up in response to a controversial campus-carry bill that narrowly passed in the state legislature in May. The measure permits the concealed carry of guns in dorms, classrooms, and buildings at state universities and community colleges, while leaving individual schools some latitude to keep parts of their properties firearm-free. The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbot at a shooting range, makes Texas the eighth state to allow firearms on campus. (In another 23 states, colleges and universities set rules for themselves, but aren\u2019t compelled to allow campus carry.) \n \n Shortly afterward, Gun Free UT \u2014 which consists of faculty, students, staff, parents, and alumni \u2014 put together a petition on change.org, with the hope of sparking a mass movement against the law. So far, nearly 2,500 people have signed the petition, and the group has acquired almost 1,000 Facebook followers. About 200 UT faculty members have pledged to refuse guns in their classrooms. UT chancellor William McCraven, a former Navy Seal, had earlier spoken out against the measure, saying, \u201cI want to make sure that we make our campuses as safe as possible. And the addition of concealed weapons on campus just [doesn\u2019t] seem like a good idea to me.\u201d \n \n Hundreds of people showed up at Thursday\u2019s Gun Free UT rally to voice their opposition to the law, which won\u2019t take effect until August 1, 2016. If nothing else, Moore and the others in Gun Free UT hope to influence how their university system applies the new statute and keep weapons out of classrooms, dorms, and offices. In Moore\u2019s view, how Texas college leaders sort out those details could lead to a grave shift in how students learn and teachers educate. \n \n Has a student ever brought a gun into one of your classes? \n \n No, but I\u2019ve had some experiences that made me very grateful students weren\u2019t allowed to carry guns on campus. I teach gay and lesbian studies. When I first got here in the early \u201990s, I had an office on the ground floor of the English building, and I had a lot of posters up advocating for gay rights. One day, someone broke into the office, burned my gay rights posters, and then wrote \u201cdepravity kills\u201d all over the windows. It was scary enough for me to know someone was willing to commit a serious act of vandalism. Were it the case that someone could have brought a gun into my office, during office hours, I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do my job. \n \n Stay Informed Subscribe to receive The Trace\u2019s daily roundup of important gun news and analysis. Email address \n \n More recently, during the semester after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2008, I was teaching an LGBT literature class. Sometimes the class riles up students, and I had a student that semester who believed, among other things, that gay people were going to hell. After a while, I guess as a kind of protest, he started coming to class and lying on the floor. He also started posting things online about not doing the reading and said that he would stop other students from doing the reading. I got nervous and went to my supervisor, and it turned out this student had problems with mental illness and had, in the past, been taken out of other classes. Subsequently, he was removed from my class, and I wound up teaching the rest of the semester in an undisclosed location, with an armed guard stationed nearby. \n \n How will allowing guns in class change things for your students? \n \n The classroom is a safe space, and we need security there. We need to be able to provide an atmosphere in which young people can become uncomfortable with certain ideas, and we don\u2019t want someone who will, when they\u2019re uncomfortable, be able to shoot off a firearm. These students are at an age when they\u2019re still not fully in control of their impulses, and they\u2019re away from home for the first time. They\u2019re very vulnerable. \n \n Now what can I do to make the students feel safe? The legislature wrote into the law that if someone tries to prevent someone from a carrying a gun into the class, they could be fined $1,500 dollars a day. So I can\u2019t put up a sign. I mean, I\u2019m allowed to ask students not to bring cell phones into my class. How could that principle not apply to guns? \n \n So going forward, what will you do if you have a disruptive student who happens to be carrying a gun? \n \n I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard faculty say, \u2018I\u2019ll just give everyone A\u2019s from now on. I\u2019m not going to risk pissing someone off if they\u2019re going to be armed.\u2019 Others have said they\u2019ll only lecture \u2014 they won\u2019t allow classroom discussion because they don\u2019t want things to get heated. Basically, we have to look at ruling out anything \u2014 any subject matter \u2014 that might seem provocative. It\u2019s very strange. Shutting down dissent and free speech is the opposite of what should happen on a college campus. Personally, I don\u2019t think I would confront a student who was disruptive if he was armed. I\u2019d rather say, \u2018Class is dismissed.\u2019 \n \n It seems difficult to avoid provocative subject matter entirely in a lot of classes. \n \n It scares me to think about it. I am accustomed to equipping my students with the skills to negotiate difficult issues. Another class I teach is early British literature \u2014 a lot of writing from 14th and 15th centuries, a lot of which is about religious controversies. Naturally, this brings up religious controversies in the present. I try to endow my students with the ability to talk openly about religious differences; it\u2019s an important skill for an educated citizenry. In the past, I\u2019ve had students flip desks and leave the room. Which is fine, because something can be learned from that. But that\u2019s different than a student pulling a gun \u2014 no one learns anything in that situation. And maybe the student who flips the desk might refrain from doing it if he thinks his classmate is armed. In that sort of environment, I\u2019m going to be much less willing to go into deep and controversial issues, which is a huge loss, since, later on in life, they\u2019ll have to grapple with deep and controversial issues. I try to teach them how to have an honest conversation with someone whose views they find repugnant. In order to learn those skills, you have to feel safe. In my women\u2019s studies classes we talk about feminism, abortion, homosexuality, transgenderism, and birth control. As you know, these aren\u2019t exactly light topics. \n \n How many professors do you know of that support campus carry? \n \n I don\u2019t know of any. And I\u2019m in touch, via social media, with hundreds and hundreds of professors. Everyone is against it. Even people who are in favor of the right to carry are against the legislation. It\u2019s not even something the people of Texas want. I can\u2019t tell you how many parents we\u2019ve heard from. They say they wouldn\u2019t have sent their children to UT if they\u2019d known about the law. \n \n Have students spoken to you about the law? \n \n I\u2019ve brought it up in all of my classes, and the students are scared, almost universally. One student said, \u2018I\u2019m gay, and I already feel like a target.\u2019 He\u2019d been sheltered growing up, and thinking about being in class with someone who is armed and might hate LGBT people really scares him and makes him wonder if he made a mistake coming to UT. \n \n Have any faculty members considered resigning over the issue? \n \n No, and I don\u2019t think that would be very helpful, or practical. It\u2019s not as if there are a ton of academic job openings, which forces us to face the law. But more importantly, I love my job. And unlike the gun lobby and arms industry, who together created this legislation, I have my students\u2019 best interests at heart. \n \n [Photo: Flickr] ||||| \n \n \n \n I fear our senses will become dulled to horrific news like Thursday\u2019s, when a gunman opened fire on an Oregon community college, killing nine and wounding 10. I fear we will forget, again and again. \n \n Oregon is one of the seven states that now have provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses. \n \n Although this latest shooting took place halfway across the country, it hit close to home here in Austin, Texas. \n \n New \u2018campus carry\u2019 law \n \n Earlier this year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed SB 11, also known as the \u201ccampus carry\u201d law. The law provides that license holders may carry concealed handguns in university buildings and classrooms, extending the reach of a previous law that allowed concealed handguns on university grounds. The law goes into effect Aug. 1, 2016 for public colleges and universities and a year later for community colleges. \n \n \n \n As a member of the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin, I wonder if we are just supposed to forget and carry on, pretending this is not an issue, writing it off as another instance of \u201chow things are here in Texas\u201d? \n \n I fear that, given the letter of the law and the limited exceptions that it allows, we will have to get used to guns inside our classrooms. \n \n I fear that the fact of sharing a classroom with students \u201cpacking heat\u201d will stop shocking us as it now does. \n \n I fear I should not even be writing this, as many gun rights activists take reactions to the extreme when an opposing view is offered. \n \n A problem for recruitment ||||| Proponents of Texas\u2019s new campus carry gun law say it could help save lives in an active shooter scenario, since those with guns could theoretically intervene or defend themselves. But that rationale has lots of critics -- many of the them faculty members -- who say more guns won\u2019t reduce violence and weapons have no place on college campuses. And the law itself has already led to one faculty casualty at the University of Texas at Austin, with the resignation of an actively teaching professor emeritus of economics who says being on a campus with untold numbers of firearms is simply not worth the risk. \n \n \u201cAs much as I have loved the experience of teaching and introducing these students to economics at the university, I have decided not to continue,\u201d Daniel S. Hamermesh, the Sue Killam Professor Emeritus, wrote in a letter to university administrators this week. \u201cWith a huge group of students my perception is that the risk that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom and start shooting at me has been substantially enhanced by the concealed-carry law.\u201d \n \n He added, \u201cI cannot believe that I am the only potential or current faculty member who is aware of and disturbed by this heightened risk. \u2026 Anything that can be done to mitigate this risk should be implemented. Applying this law broadly will detract from both faculty well-being and from the national and international reputation of this university.\u201d \n \n After failed attempts in previous legislative sessions, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 11 earlier this year, making it legal for licensed gun owners to carry concealed weapons into college and university buildings, including classrooms. The law takes effect next summer for public universities and in 2017 for community colleges. Seven other states have laws allowing handguns on campus. \n \n Hamermesh, who\u2019s taught at the university since 1993 and retired last year, was contracted to teach a large introductory economics class of about 500 students this semester and in each of the next two fall terms. He\u2019s breaking his agreement to avoid teaching in Texas after guns become legal in his classroom. \n \n Hamermesh said in an interview that, as a retiree, deciding to leave Texas is much easier that it is for other professors who are just starting or in the middle of their careers. But his decision and the factors that motivated it are real -- not just symbolic, he said. \n \n \u201cPartly because I have other alternatives and partly because I\u2019m 72 and need the money not very much, it\u2019s fairly easy for me to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the number of kids I have in my class, the risk to me is greater than for people who have 30 kids in their class \u2026. With campus carry the risk increased and I simply don\u2019t wish to face that risk.\u201d \n \n Hamermesh has publicly advocated against campus carry before, so he said his decision wasn\u2019t just motivated by the recent mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, a campus carry state, which killed nine and wounded nine. \n \n But other faculty members in Texas have become more vocal since the Umpqua Community College shooting -- the third-most-deadly campus shooting ever, with the second-worst occurring at UT Austin in 1966 -- and another recent on-campus shooting involving two faculty members in Mississippi, another campus carry state. \n \n Javier Auyero, the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Professor of Latin American Sociology at Austin, authored an op-ed arguing against campus carry this week that ran in Time, among other outlets. \u201cAlthough this latest shooting took place halfway across the country, it hit close to home here in Austin,\u201d Auyero wrote. \u201cWith campus carry, social, political or academic interactions will have the potential to explode in lethal violence. We knew that before the campus carry law passed, and we know it now.\u201d \n \n Auyero is member of the group UT Gun Free, which has held several anti-campus carry forums on campus in recent weeks and garnered nearly 4,600 signatures on an anti-campus carry petition. He referred questions on Hamermesh\u2019s departure to the group\u2019s organizers. Paloma Diaz, a scholarly programs director and faculty liaison with the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies on campus, said via email that Hamermesh\u2019s decision \u201csends a strong message.\u201d \n \n Another member of UT Gun Free, Lisa Moore, a professor of English, also has spoken out against the campus carry law in the wake of the Oregon shooting. In an interview with The Trace, Moore explained how she thought the law would inhibit classroom discussions, especially those on more controversial topics, at the expense of academic freedom and student learning. \n \n \u201cI try to endow my students with the ability to talk openly about religious differences; it\u2019s an important skill for an educated citizenry,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve had students flip desks and leave the room. Which is fine, because something can be learned from that. But that\u2019s different than a student pulling a gun -- no one learns anything in that situation. And maybe the student who flips the desk might refrain from doing it if he thinks his classmate is armed. In that sort of environment, I\u2019m going to be much less willing to go into deep and controversial issues, which is a huge loss, since, later on in life, they\u2019ll have to grapple with deep and controversial issues.\u201d \n \n David Smith-Soto, a senior lecturer of multimedia journalism at the University of Texas at El Paso, started protesting SB 11 earlier this year, when he put a \u201cno guns\u201d sign outside his classroom door. He made his message more public with an op-ed in The Huffington Post following the Mississippi shooting at Delta State University, just a day before the Umpqua shooting. \n \n \u201cIt is not our job as university professors to engage in gun battles in our classrooms,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn a civil society of laws, we must depend on law enforcement to battle the gunmen. That is why I consider the campus carry law a betrayal by our elected officials. Instead of protecting us and contributing to the common good, they are putting us in mortal danger. While they revel in this little victory in their make-believe world of right-wing politics, we are left facing real guns in our lecture halls.\u201d \n \n Smith-Soto also criticized an aspect of the new law in which institutions are left to define which spaces on campus will allow guns and which won\u2019t (blanket bans are prohibited), calling it proof that the law as a whole is \u201cbogus.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhy should one part of the campus or one program at the university be selected to be gun-free?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWould that be because the presence of guns is disruptive, dangerous, threatening? Then that reasoning should apply to the entire campus. It implies that carrying a concealed gun on campus is so dangerous that some areas, perhaps programs such as child care and some laboratories, should be gun-free. Therefore, the entire university should be gun-free.\u201d \n \n In an interview, Smith-Soto said he still has his \u201cno gun\u201d sign up in his classroom, but that he\u2019s moved it inside the door as not to foist the policy on other professors, since it could be illegal. \n \n He said enforcing his policy could cost him his job, but that he\u2019ll keep doing it. \n \n \u201cI intend to cancel the class if anybody comes in and [says] he or she has a gun, and I\u2019ll continue to do that until there are no guns in my classroom,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have to keep canceling class they\u2019ll have to fire me, I guess.\u201d \n \n Mary Aldridge, executive director of the Texas Faculty Association, which represents the interests of college faculty and support staff, said the vast majority of the group\u2019s members opposed campus carry in a summer poll. And opposition has only grown louder in light of recent events, she said. \n \n \u201cFaculty on many of our campuses are actively involved in trying to mitigate the rules,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cThere are faculty I know who are looking for jobs elsewhere but for obvious reasons don't want to make this public until they find something.\u201d \n \n Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the UT Austin, said via email that the university, as required by the new law, is gathering input from faculty, staff and others about how to comply with the campus carry law while ensuring safety. He said the university understands the concerns Hamermesh and other faculty members have raised about their classroom safety, and asks \u201cthat the campus community continue to work with university leadership in developing policies for implementing this new state law.\u201d \n \n Susswein noted that the University of Texas System's chancellor, Adm. William McRaven, retired, shared his position on campus carry -- that it would make campuses less safe, not more -- with the legislature before it made it law. \n \n Hamermesh said while the university might have done more to advocate against the legislation, he in no way blamed it for the new law. \n \n \u201cThis is Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cThese [legislators] will do anything they can to cater to the right-wingers.\u201d \n \n Asked if he thought other faculty members might follow suit and leave the state, Hamermesh guessed they wouldn\u2019t. But he said recruiting top faculty members might be harder with the specter of guns in their classrooms. \n \n \u201cFaculty are a very risk-averse group, except when it comes to ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might scare away good people.\u201d",

The Calgary-based pipeline company says the United States has never before denied a cross-border oil pipeline from Canada, and the rejection of the project designed to transport vast quantities of Canadian oil sands and some Bakken crude to Gulf Coast refineries \u201cwas arbitrary and unjustified.\u201d \n \n TransCanada\u2019s announcement comes as Mr. Obama is due to host Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a state dinner in Washington in March. At the same time, Washington and Ottawa are working with the Mexican government to forge a North American energy and climate agreement that would move the three countries closer to a continental market. \n \n In rejecting the proposal last November, Obama called crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands \u201cdirtier\u201d but acknowledged that debate over the pipeline has played an \u201coverinflated role\u201d in his country\u2019s political discourse. \n \n \u201cThis pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others,\u201d the President said, before concluding that the project wouldn\u2019t significantly help his country\u2019s economy, lower gasoline prices or increase energy security. \n \n In its notice to claim to arbitration under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, TransCanada\u2019s lawyers argue environmental activists turned opposition to Keystone XL into a litmus test for politicians to prove their environmental credentials. \u201cThe activists\u2019 strategy succeeded.\u201d \n \n On Wednesday, TransCanada said in a news release that the $15-billion (U.S.) claim it will make through its NAFTA action represents the initial estimated loss of value. \u201cTransCanada has invested billions of dollars in assets that have now been rendered useless for the intended purpose, specifically the transportation of Canadian and American oil.\u201d \n \n The midstream energy firm said it had every reason to expect its application would get a green light, as the application met the same criteria the U.S. State Department applied when approving applications to construct other, similar cross-border pipelines. \n \n \u201cThe U.S. State Department acknowledged the denial was not based on the merits of the project. Rather, it was a symbolic gesture based on speculation about the perceptions of the international community regarding the administration\u2019s leadership on climate change and the President\u2019s assertion of unprecedented, independent powers,\u201d TransCanada said. \n \n The company noted that the U.S. has never before lost a NAFTA claim, however, \u201cwe have undertaken a careful evaluation of the administration\u2019s action as it relates to NAFTA and believe there has been a clear violation of NAFTA in these circumstances.\u201d \n \n Toronto trade lawyer Lawrence Herman said these types of lawsuits \u201care all long shots,\u201d but TransCanada appears to have a solid case in arguing that it was unfairly treated and that the decision was politically motivated. \n \n \u201cThe argument is that they were not given fair and equitable treatment as required under the NAFTA,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve thought for some time that that this was a politicized issue, and there are good arguments that decisions affecting Keystone were based on political considerations. To the degree that that is so, TransCanada has a viable if not a strong case.\u201d \n \n Activists who opposed the pipeline insist the rejection was a legitimate policy decision, driven by concerns about rising greenhouse gas emissions in the oil sands, and by worries about local pollution from pipeline spills. \n \n \u201cThe rejection of Keystone XL was justified in order to protect the land, water and property rights of farmers and ranchers,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Nebraska, a prominent local group. \u201cThis desperate attempt by TransCanada is a move to show their shareholders they have a viable project when they have hit a dead end.\u201d \n \n Bill McKibben, founder of the climate group 350.org, said the legal action isn\u2019t going to get the pipeline built. \u201cThe idea that some trade agreement should force us to overheat the planet\u2019s atmosphere is, quite simply, insane. But the oil industry is so used to always winning that I fear this kind of tantrum is predictable.\u201d \n \n The federal government offered little comment on the lawsuit, but said it would not undermine Ottawa\u2019s effort to forge a closer energy relationship with the United States. \n \n \u201cThis is a private lawsuit that is being launched by TransCanada under Chapter 11 and the corporation has the right to launch and they\u2019ve made the decision this is how they\u2019d like to proceed,\u201d said Adam Barratt, spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister St\u00e9phane Dion, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt would be inappropriate for the government to comment any further at this time.\u201d \n \n However, Mr. Barratt noted that the Liberal government had expressed its disappointment in November when President Obama announced the decision. \n \n \u201cThe relationship between Canada and the United States is on a very warm footing, and the discussions on energy in North America are much broader than Keystone,\u201d he said. \n \n Report Typo/Error ||||| By Nia Williams and Valerie Volcovici \n \n CALGARY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp sued the U.S government on Wednesday to reverse President Barack Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, and also plans to seek $15 billion in damages from a trade tribunal. \n \n TranCanada's lawsuit in a federal court in Houston, Texas, called rejection of its permit to build the pipeline unconstitutional. In a separate action under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the company said the pipeline permit denial was \"arbitrary and unjustified.\" \n \n The company's U.S. lawsuit does not seek monetary damages but wants the permit denial invalidated and seeks a ruling that no future president can block construction. Its request for $15 billion under NAFTA reflects its desire to recover its investment in the pipeline. \n \n Defendants in the Houston lawsuit are U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Sally Jewell, Secretary of the Department of Interior. \n \n Obama, who is not named as a defendant, rejected the cross-border crude oil pipeline last November, seven years after it was first proposed, saying it would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. \n \n The Keystone XL was designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico coast. \n \n All the Democratic U.S. presidential candidates, including front runner Hillary Clinton, oppose the pipeline while most Republican candidates are in favor.",

Justin Trudeau is due to host Obama at a state dinner in Washington in March. \u2013 TransCanada is suing the Obama administration over its rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, arguing that the move violates the North American Free Trade Agreement. The company says the decision not to green-light the pipeline was politically motivated and based on speculation about the White House's leadership on climate change, the Wall Street Journal reports. \"TransCanada has invested billions of dollars in assets that have now been rendered useless for the intended purpose, specifically the transportation of Canadian and American oil,\" the company said in a statement. \"The US State Department acknowledged the denial was not based on the merits of the project. Rather, it was a symbolic gesture based onSpeculation about the perceptions of the international community regarding the administration\u2019s leadership in climate change and the President\u2019s assertion of unprecedented, independent powers.\" A trade lawyer says TransCanada appears to have a solid case. \"I've thought for some time that that this was a politicized issue, and there are good arguments that decisions affecting Keystone were based on political considerations,\" he tells the Globe and Mail. \"To the degree that that is so, TransCanada has a viable if not a strong case.\" \u2013 TransCanada says President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline was \"arbitrary and unjustified.\" The company has filed a lawsuit in US District Court in Houston seeking to overturn the president's decision, which it says is unconstitutional, reports Reuters. TransCanada also plans to file a separate action under the North American Free Trade Agreement seeking $15 billion in damages from a trade tribunal for what it says was an \"unjustified\" decision. A rep for Canada's foreign affairs minister says the government was \"disappointed\" in the decision to reject the pipeline, but \"the relationship between Canada and the United States is on a very warm footing, and the discussions on energy in North America are much broader than Keystone,\" the Toronto Star reports.",

    "document": "In the dead of night Wednesday night in Lausanne, Switzerland, Energy Secretary Ernie Moniz and his Iranian counterpart haggled over one of the last issues holding up a nuclear agreement with world powers: Iran\u2019s future research into next-generation new centrifuge designs that can accelerate its path to a nuclear weapon. \n \n The meeting finally wrapped up at 6 a.m., said a senior administration official, \u201cand that is not because we were up early.\u201d \n \n But how that key issue was resolved remains fuzzy. An Obama administration fact sheet on the deal says only that Iran will be able to conduct \u201climited research and development\u201d into the centrifuges \u2014 which are far more efficient than the relatively crude devices Iran now operates \u2014 \u201caccording to a schedule and parameters which have been agreed to\u201d by Iran, the United States, and five other world powers. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Although Iran will be barred for a decade from enriching uranium with the advanced devices, that schedule and those parameters remain otherwise unknown. \n \n Critics of the agreement were quick to zero in on the question. \u201cThis is a bad framework that will lead to a bad and dangerous deal,\u201d said an Israeli government source in Jerusalem, who cited as a key complaint the fact that Iran \u201cwill continue its centrifuge research and development.\u201d \n \n The research-and-development question is just one of a handful of key issues left unresolved, at least in public, and which could endanger the agreement\u2019s survival. \n \n There was much for Obama officials \u2014 and their negotiating partners in France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia \u2014 to be happy about in the framework deal, whose details must be nailed down by June 30. It requires Iran to uninstall more of its centrifuges than earlier reports had suggested would be required. It subjects Iran to extensive snooping by international inspectors, with some surveillance extending for 25 years. It mandates the redesign of a nuclear reactor so that its spent fuel can\u2019t be used to make a bomb. \n \n But the White House and State Department will find themselves defending some questions the agreement essentially fudged. \n \n In addition to the centrifuge research, another key issue is the fate of Iran\u2019s stockpile of low-enriched uranium. That is material which has been enriched much of the way toward the purity needed for a nuclear weapon, therefore making it dangerous for Iran to possess. \n \n The administration\u2019s fact sheet says Iran must \u201creduce\u201d that supply of nuclear material, from more than 10 tons currently on hand to just a few hundred pounds \u2014 less than enough to create a bomb. \n \n But it doesn\u2019t specify how that will happen. U.S. officials had long expected that Iran would agree to export most of its low-enriched uranium out of the country, ensuring that it can\u2019t be diverted to military use. Late in the talks this week, Iran toughened its position, insisting that it would merely dilute that uranium on its own soil to a form unsuitable for weapons use. \n \n Thursday\u2019s deal punts that question for later. At a news conference in Lausanne, Secretary of State John Kerry said Iran had committed to selling the material on the international market or diluting it to a harmless state. But critics of the deal noted that diluted uranium can still be converted to a more dangerous form. \n \n Some nuclear experts downplayed the stockpile issue, however. \n \n Jofi Joseph, a former national security council aide in the Obama White House who handled nuclear nonproliferation issues, said it would be laborious for Iran to reconvert its uranium. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s more a question of political optics,\u201d Joseph said. \u201c\u201cRemember, it\u2019s important politically for Iranian leaders to not be seen as \u2018surrendering\u2019 anything, which is why they fought so hard against export.\u201d \n \n That point was echoed by a senior Obama official on Thursday, speaking more generally about the deal: \u201cThere is no doubt that [Iranian Foreign Minister] Javad Zarif will have to sell this deal just as we will. And his task is hard and complicated.\u201d \n \n Likely to be most problematic of all is Iran\u2019s response to questions about its past research into nuclear weapons production, including bomb designs and detonators. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that Iran has stonewalled on all but one of a dozen questions the agency has posed. Iran has denied the IAEA access to its Parchin military base, where the United Nations nuclear watchdog group suspects it tested explosives that could be used to detonate a bomb. \n \n Iran denies it has ever pursued a military application to its nuclear program. But U.S. intelligence officials say they are confident Iran aggressively researched bomb-making until 2003, when that aspect of its program was halted. \n \n Thursday\u2019s agreement is vague on this score. The fact sheet says only that Iran \u201cwill implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA\u2019s concerns,\u201d but those measures aren\u2019t detailed. \n \n The past research into bomb-making \u201cappears to be one of the few Achilles\u2019 heels here,\u201d said Joseph. On that point, he added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear as if Iran agreed to do anything specific.\u201d ||||| Key players in Congress -\u2013 Republicans and Democrats -- are skeptical of the Iran deal and want to see the fine print. \n \n No one is ruling out a big push ahead on new Iran sanctions, or a measure to require President Obama to get congressional approval, two pieces of legislation the White House strongly opposes. \n \n Iran Nuclear Deal: Tentative Agreement Reached \n \n Iran Nuclear Negotiations - Your Questions Answered \n \n Why Some Think 47 GOP Senators Broke the Law With Iran Letter \n \n But there appears to be a willingness to hear the administration out in promised briefings on the framework when lawmakers return to Washington on April 13. \n \n An aide to House Speaker John Boehner tells ABC News that the approach in the House is not a \u201cwait-and-see until June 30th\u201d posture, but that Republicans want the briefings, a chance to review the details and discuss possible next steps with members. \n \n Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said today \u201cit is important that we wait to see the specific details of today\u2019s announcement\u201d and that everyone \u201cmust remain clear-eyed.\u201d He vowed an April 14 committee vote on a bill to require congressional review of a nuclear deal, but there is no plan yet to bring it up for a vote in the full chamber. (Corker has said he\u2019d like to have a veto-proof majority before the bill is voted on by the full Senate.) \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ll know more in the days ahead, after April 14,\u201d an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told ABC News. \n \n Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was surprised so many details were revealed in the framework and said that Congress should \u201cbe careful not to scuttle the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution. \n \n \u201cI think there is sufficient detail that has been arrived at these negotiations that Congress needs to be careful not to scuttle the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution,\u201d Schiff said in an interview. \u201cThe last thing we want is for the international community to think that we came this close to a negotiated end to Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the United States Congress got in the way.\u201d \n \n Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, the author of the controversial open letter to Iran's leaders signed by 47 Republican senators, called the interim deal a \"list of very dangerous U.S. concessions that will put Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.\" \n \n \u201cI plan to work with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have already expressed disquiet about terms such as these, to stop this deal from going forward, to keep America safe, and to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,\u201d he added. \n \n Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is likely weeks away from announcing a presidential bid, tweeted his skepticism of the deal, but said he is awaiting more information. \n \n Awaiting more details on #Iran deal but early reports indicate this is Obama admin spinning diplomatic failure. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) April 2, 2015 \n \n The White House fired another warning shot this afternoon reiterating veto threats for any legislation that \u201cundercuts our ability to get the deal done.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe think it\u2019s best for members of Congress to take a look at the framework and then give the space to look at final details between now and June,\u201d said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. \n \n Congress needs to \u201cwait and see what the deal is, and then we can determine the best way to support Congress playing an oversight role,\u201d he said. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading lawmakers from both parties in Congress responded cautiously on Thursday to the tentative framework for a nuclear deal between Western powers and Iran, demanding to review any final agreement but pointedly refraining from a vow to kill the accord. \n \n Congress could still scuttle a deal if lawmakers move forward with tough new sanctions on Iran just as economic and nuclear penalties are supposed to be lifted. And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the panel would continue with plans to formally draft bipartisan legislation on April 14 insisting on congressional examination of any agreement. \n \n The committee\u2019s leadership was looking for ways to shape a bill that would gain broad approval in both parties. \n \n \u201cWe want the right to go through the details of the deal and to decide whether we believe congressionally mandated sanctions should be alleviated,\u201d Mr. Corker said in an interview. \n \n That sentiment was bipartisan. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cIf Congress appears to be bypassed, that\u2019s not good for the national debate and national unity as we move forward with Iran,\u201d said Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. \n \n President Obama made a pointed appeal to Congress to let diplomacy work, even as he promised consultation. \n \n \u201cIf Congress kills this deal \u2014 not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative \u2014 then it\u2019s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy,\u201d he said at the White House. \u201cInternational unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.\u201d \n \n But a senior administration official hinted at compromise, at least on the review legislation. He reiterated the president\u2019s promise to veto legislation imposing new sanctions on Iran, but said that a previous veto threat on the congressional review bill applied only to the measure as it was originally drafted. \n \n Continue reading the main story Video \n \n The jousting is likely to continue for months, and pressure could mount on Republican leaders to toughen their stand. Negotiators must turn a framework into a detailed agreement by this summer, and legal sanctions imposed by the United States will not have to be lifted anytime soon, possibly not for years. The agreement is not likely to require action from Congress until the next presidential administration. \n \n But beyond the leadership suites, a more hard-edge response came quickly. \n \n \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s efforts to get a deal at any cost will have a greater cost than the world can bear,\u201d said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. \u201cIf this deal moves forward, the consequences for the U.S. and our allies in the region will be dire.\u201d \n \n Some Democrats hailed it. \u201cWe\u2019ve set the stage for a paradigm shift in the country and in the region,\u201d said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. \n \n But other Democrats tried to find a middle ground between embracing the accord and undermining it. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he wanted unanimity around Congress\u2019s request for review, and that aspects of the legislation would have to be toned down. \n \n The bill demands that the administration submit the full text of any agreement to Congress, including classified annexes. It would prohibit the removal of any congressional sanctions for 60 days after a final accord, and would require the president to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Without that certification, it mandates a quick return of sanctions. \n \n The original version was written by Mr. Corker and Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, a hard-liner on the Iran talks. But Mr. Menendez\u2019s indictment Wednesday on corruption charges, and his decision to step down from the top Democratic spot on the Foreign Relations Committee, elevated the more diplomatic voice of Mr. Cardin. \n \n \u201cThe more unity we can have among Democrats and the White House, the stronger U.S. foreign policy will be,\u201d Mr. Cardin said. \n \n In general, the most senior Republicans, while cool to the deal, spoke in measured tones. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered,\u201d said the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio. \u201cWe will stand strong on behalf of the American people and everyone in the Middle East who values freedom, security and peace.\u201d \n \n The biggest question is not about the congressional review legislation but about whether Republican leaders will try to resurrect House and Senate measures that would impose tough new sanctions on Iran. Both versions have had broad bipartisan support, but their passage could imperil a final deal. \n \n \u201cThere will be a move to apply new sanctions or deprive the president of the ability to waive existing sanctions,\u201d said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While that inclination is present in both chambers and in both parties, he said, \u201cthe tendency will be to vote for or against the president based on party.\u201d \n \n Mr. Obama, announcing the tentative accord in the White House Rose Garden, said the issues at stake were \u201cbigger than politics.\u201d \n \n \u201cThese are matters of war and peace, and they should be evaluated based on the facts and what is ultimately best for the American people and for our national security,\u201d he said. \n \n But lawmakers in both parties asked pointed questions about the framework presented. Mr. Corker said that he believed sanctions would be lifted too quickly, and that he wanted to better understand what would happen to Iran\u2019s fissile nuclear materials. Mr. Engel was pleased that Iran\u2019s array of centrifuges would be reduced by two-thirds, and that inspections of uranium mining and milling would last 25 years. \n \n \u201cBut tell me why Fordo remains open,\u201d he said, referring to Iran\u2019s underground enrichment site. \u201cWhy not just destroy it?\u201d",

Bob Corker tells the Times \"we want the right to go through the details of the deal and to decide whether we believe congressionally mandated sanctions should be alleviated.\" Keeping the agreement's framework shaky is the lack of detailed schedules and logistics on certain key points, including nuclear R&D and a uranium-reduction program, Politico notes. The bill would insist on a full review of all agreement text, ban the removal of sanctions for 60 days after a final deal is reached, and mandate that the president check up on Iran's compliance every 90 days, the Times notes.

    "document": "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Nations have so dragged their feet in battling climate change that the situation has grown critical and the risk of severe economic disruption is rising, according to a draft United Nations report. Another 15 years of failure to limit carbon emissions could make the problem virtually impossible to solve with current technologies, experts found. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A delay would most likely force future generations to develop the ability to suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and store them underground to preserve the livability of the planet, the report found. But it is not clear whether such technologies will ever exist at the necessary scale, and even if they do, the approach would probably be wildly expensive compared with taking steps now to slow emissions. \n \n The report said that governments of the world were still spending far more money to subsidize fossil fuels than to accelerate the shift to cleaner energy, thus encouraging continued investment in projects like coal-burning power plants that pose a long-term climate risk. \n \n Photo \n \n While the spread of technologies like solar power and wind farms might give the impression of progress, the report said, such developments are being overtaken by rising emissions from fossil fuels over the past decade, especially in fast-growing countries like China. And one of the most important sources of low-carbon energy, nuclear power, is actually declining over time as a percentage of the global energy mix, the report said. \n \n Unless far greater efforts are made to reduce emissions, \u201cthe fundamental drivers of emissions growth are expected to persist despite major improvements in energy supply\u201d and in the efficiency with which energy is used, the report said. \n \n The new warnings come in a draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations panel of climate experts that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its efforts to analyze and communicate the risks of climate change. The report is not final, but a draft dated Dec. 17 was leaked this week and was first reported by Reuters. The New York Times obtained a copy independently. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Business leaders will tackle many of the problems raised in the draft next week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where a day will be devoted to addressing the rising economic costs of climate change \u2014 and the costs to businesses and governments of solving the problem. \n \n Within the business community, \u201cthere is an awakening of increasing economic risk \u2014 a recognition that operating conditions are changing and we need to respond,\u201d said Dominic Waughray, head of environmental initiatives for the forum. \u201cThere has been a failure of government to address these solutions. If there is an alliance of companies that can bite off pieces of the puzzle, it might help.\u201d \n \n In the dry language of a technical committee, the draft outlines an increasingly dire situation. \n \n Even as the early effects of climate change are starting to be felt around the world, the panel concluded that efforts are lagging not only in reducing emissions, but also in adapting to the climatic changes that have become inevitable. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n It is true, the report found, that the political willingness to tackle climate change is growing in many countries and new policies are spreading, but the report said these were essentially being outrun by the rapid growth of fossil fuels. \n \n While emissions appear to have fallen in recent years in some of the wealthiest countries, that is somewhat of an illusion, the report found. The growth of international trade means many of the goods consumed in wealthy countries are now made abroad \u2014 so that those countries have, in effect, outsourced their greenhouse gas emissions to countries like China. \n \n Emissions in the United States rose slightly in 2013, but are still about 10 percent below their 2005 levels, largely because of the newfound abundance of natural gas, which produces less greenhouse gases than burning coal. \n \n The Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty meant to limit emissions, has \u201cnot been as successful as intended,\u201d the report found. That is partly because some important countries like the United States refused to ratify it or later withdrew, but also because of flaws within the treaty itself, the report found. The treaty exempted developing countries from taking strong action, for instance, a decision that many experts now say was a mistake. \n \n Efforts are underway to negotiate a new international treaty to replace Kyoto, but it is not even supposed to take effect until 2020, and it is unclear whether countries will agree on ambitious goals to limit emissions. It is equally unclear how much political support a new treaty will gain in China and the United States, the world\u2019s largest emitters. \n \n The Obama administration is pushing for a deal, but any treaty would have to be ratified by the Senate; many Republicans and some coal-state Democrats are wary, fearing economic damage to the country. \n \n The new report suggests, however, that the real question is whether to take some economic pain now, or more later. \n \n Nations have agreed to try to limit the warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. Even though it will be exceedingly difficult to meet, this target would still mean vast ecological and economic damage, experts have found. But the hope is that these would come on slowly enough to be somewhat manageable; having no target would be to risk catastrophic disruption, the thinking goes. \n \n As scientists can best figure, the target requires that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, stay below 500 parts per million. The level recently surpassed 400, and at present growth rates will surpass 500 within a few decades. \n \n If countries permit continued high emissions growth until 2030, the draft report found, the target will most likely be impossible to meet, at least without a hugely expensive crash program to rebuild the energy system, and even that might not work. \n \n If emissions do overshoot the target, the report found, future generations would probably have to develop ways to pull greenhouse gases out of the air. It is fairly clear this will be technically possible. It could be achieved, for instance, by growing bioenergy crops that take up carbon dioxide, burning the resulting fuel and then injecting the emissions into underground formations.

(Nati Harnik/AP) \n \n A group of the nation\u2019s leading environmental organizations is breaking with the administration over its energy policy, arguing that the White House needs to apply a strict climate test to all of its energy decisions or risk undermining one of the president\u2019s top \u00adsecond-term priorities. \n \n The rift \u2014 reflected in a letter sent to President Obama by 18 groups, including the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund and Earthjustice \u2014 signals that the administration is under pressure to confront the fossil-fuel industry or risk losing support from a critical part of its political base during an already difficult election year. \n \n For years, the administration has pushed aggressively to limit pollution from coal-fired power plants and improve fuel efficiency in transportation while also embracing domestic production of natural gas, oil and coal under an \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy. This has angered environmental groups, which reluctantly went along until Thursday\u2019s break. \n \n \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in an interview. \n \n The criticism came on the same day that the fossil-fuel industry and its congressional allies began separate efforts to challenge the administration\u2019s environmental policies. That suggests that the White House will have to marshal additional resources to defend the work it is already doing to address climate change. \n \n In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama promised to tackle climate change. How is he doing? Nia-Malika Henderson talks to Jeff Goodell of Rolling Stone about Obama's environmental policy. (The Washington Post) \n \n The American Petroleum Institute announced a new advertising and electoral campaign that will promote domestic oil and gas production.At the same time, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) asked the Government Accountability Office to determine whether the Senate can use the Congressional Review Act to reverse a proposed rule to limit carbon emissions from new power plants. \n \n The new pressure from both sides \u2014 one demanding that President Obama reconcile his commitment to fight climate change with his other energy policies, the other pushing him to scale back environmental regulation \u2014 could have an impact on critical permitting decisions on issues ranging from the Keystone XL pipeline to natural gas exports and federal coal leases. \n \n The environmental groups\u2019 initiative was perhaps more surprising, given their long support of Obama\u2019s efforts to combat climate change. \n \n \u201cWe believe that continued reliance on an \u2018all of the above\u2019 energy strategy would be fundamentally at odds with your goal of cutting carbon pollution and would undermine our nation\u2019s capacity to respond to the threat of climate disruption,\u201d the environmentalists wrote in a letter obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cWith record-high atmospheric carbon concentrations and the rising threat of extreme heat, drought, wildfires and super storms, America\u2019s energy policies must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, not simply reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\u201d \n \n The groups suggested that Obama should apply a strict climate test \u201cto all decisions regarding new fossil fuel development,\u201d including hydraulic fracturing and coal mining on public lands, as well as drilling in the Arctic Ocean. \n \n Dan Utech, special assistant to the president for energy and climate change, said in an interview that the administration is \u201ctaking a number of steps under the climate action plan to drive down emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases.\u201d \n \n \u201cAt the same time, obviously we\u2019re going to keep using oil and gas for some period of time,\u201d Utech said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to produce these things here than import them. They go together, and they\u2019re not really at odds.\u201d \n \n David Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California at San Diego and an energy expert, wrote in an \u00ade-mail that several factors explain why the administration\u2019s energy policy is plagued by internal conflicts. Since most of it is done through executive authority rather than \u201cwith clean new legislation . . . policy gets advanced on a thousand fronts, each with their own constraints.\u201d \n \n \u201cSome are easy, such as some administrative standards on energy efficiency. Others are much harder, like federal lands policy,\u201d he wrote. \n \n Decisions about whether the administration should allow the Keystone XL pipeline to cross the Canadian border or permit new liquefied natural gas terminals to be built \u201care emerging as hot-button issues,\u201d Victor added, because there is more oil and gas to be extracted \u201cthan people thought even a few years ago.\u201d \n \n Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), co-chairman of the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, said in an interview that while environmentalists are right to push for a rapid transition to clean energy, senior administration officials have made it clear in recent weeks that they\u2019re committed to pursuing that goal. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a real warming trend at the White House toward listening to ideas on how to build a bridge to a fully sustainable energy strategy,\u201d he said. \n \n Jack Gerard, the API president and chief executive who introduced his group\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Energy, America\u2019s Choice\u201d campaign at the National Press Club on Thursday, said in an interview that the president faces \u201ca test of leadership\u201d on whether he will seize \u201cthe chance of a generation to make the United States the energy superpower it can become.\u201d \n \n Lawmakers are trying to block some of the president\u2019s climate initiatives through the omnibus spending bill that passed the Senate on Thursday night. That measure would require the administration to submit a report on its spending on global warming initiatives within 120 days of submitting its next budget request and prohibit it from trying to limit funding for overseas coal plants. \n \n Heather Zichal, who served as Obama\u2019s top energy and climate adviser until leaving the White House late last year, said the administration has pursued policies that target major sources of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when it faces considerable congressional opposition. \n \n \u201cAs a whole, what this administration has done is gone after the biggest and most meaningful emissions, and they have an agenda that fits the political environment in which they operate,\u201d she said.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Protect Environmental workers move disposal barrels to a staging area outside the apartment of a healthcare worker who treated Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan and tested positive for the disease, Monday,... (Associated Press) \n \n About 70 staff members at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital were involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan after he was hospitalized, including a nurse now being treated for the same Ebola virus that killed the Liberian man who was visiting Dallas, according to medical records his family provided to The Associated Press. \n \n The size of the medical team reflects the hospital's intense effort to save Duncan's life, but it also suggests that many other people could have been exposed to the virus during Duncan's time in an isolation unit. \n \n On Monday, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the infection of the nurse means the agency must broaden the pool of people getting close monitoring. Authorities have said they do not know how 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham was infected, but they suspect some kind of breach in the hospital's protocol. \n \n The medical records given to the AP offer clues, both to what happened and who was involved, but the hospital said the CDC does not have them. \n \n A CDC spokeswoman said the agency reviewed the medical records with Duncan's care team and concluded that the documents were not helpful in identifying those who interacted directly with the patient. \n \n \"This is not something we can afford to experiment with. We need to get this right,\" said Ruth McDermott-Levy, who directs the Center for Global and Public Health in Villanova University's College of Nursing. \n \n Until now, the CDC has been actively monitoring 48 people who might have had contact with Duncan after he fell ill with an infection but before he was put in isolation. The number included 10 people known to have contact and 38 who may have had contact, including people he was staying with and health care professionals who attended to him during an emergency room visit from which he was sent home. None is sick. \n \n The CDC has not yet established a firm number of health care workers who had contact with Duncan. \n \n \"If this one individual was infected \u2014 and we don't know how \u2014 within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. \"We do not today have a number of such exposed people or potentially exposed health care workers. It's a relatively large number, we think in the end.\" \n \n Caregivers who began treating Duncan after he tested positive for Ebola were following a \"self-monitoring regimen\" in which they were instructed to take their temperatures regularly and report any symptoms. But they were not considered at high risk. Pham went to the hospital Friday night after she took her temperature and found she had a fever. \n \n Typically, the nurses, doctors and technicians caring for a contagious patient in isolation would be treating other people as well, and going home to their families after decontaminating themselves. The hospital has refused to answer questions about their specific duties. \n \n The 1,400-plus pages of medical records show that nurses, doctors and other hospital employees wore face shields, double gowns, protective footwear and even hazmat suits to avoid touching any of Duncan's bodily fluids. Ebola spreads through direct contact with those fluids, usually blood, feces and vomit. The virus has also been detected in urine, semen and breast milk, and it may be in saliva and tears. \n \n CDC officials said there were chinks in that protection at Texas Presbyterian, but they have not identified them and are investigating. \n \n \"Patient had large, extremely watery diarrhea,\" a nurse wrote in a report filed the day Duncan tested positive. \n \n Another nurse noted that Duncan's urine was \"darker in color with noted blood streaks.\" \n \n It was unclear from the records released to the AP how many of the approximately 70 individuals involved in Duncan's care had direct contact with his body or fluids. \n \n Dr. Aileen Marty, a World Health Organization doctor who recently returned to Florida International University after a month fighting Ebola in Nigeria, said no amount of protection is going to help if hospital workers do not put on and take off their protective layers carefully. \n \n \"The first thing in caring for someone with Ebola is to do everything in your power to never become a victim,\" she said. \n \n And tracking all contacts, even within the medical setting, is complicated. \n \n Generally, the first step in locating care providers for isolated infected patients is a personnel log on the door, \"that should have everyone going in and out, signing in and out,\" said Dr. Lisa Esolen, Geisinger Health System's Medical Director of Health Services and Infection Prevention and Control. Medical records indicate the Dallas hospital had a log. \n \n On the day before Duncan died, records indicate that at least nine caregivers entered and exited the room. \n \n A spokesman for Texas Health Resources, the hospital's parent company, said the CDC probably has a log from the room door that would list everyone who got close to Duncan. \n \n Dr. Christopher Ohl, who heads Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's infectious-disease department and has worked with the CDC in the past, said the expanding monitoring \"is an abundance of caution that's probably beyond what needs to be done\" because medical caregivers will notice if they're getting a fever, and they're not contagious until that point. \n \n \"You start to know when you get those body aches and headaches, most people know that,\" he said. \"It's not like you're surprised by it. Most people can figure out what to do when that happens.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Maud Beelman and Jamie Stengle contributed to this report. ||||| The 33-year-old freelance cameraman who contracted Ebola in Liberia is fighting for his life at the University of Nebraska Medical Center this week.

    "document": "Print Share + Twin Suicide Pact Had Columbine Connection \n \n ARAPAHOE COUNTY, Colo. (CBS4) \u2015 \n \n CBS4 Investigator Rick Sallinger has learned why twin sisters from Australia may have come to Colorado to carry out their suicide pact.Investigators found a magazine cover related to the Columbine tragedy at the La Quinta Inn where Kristin and Candace Hermeler, 29, were staying before they shot themselves. But their connection dates back to 1999, just a couple of months after the shooting.Kristin wrote two letters to Brooks Brown, a student at Columbine High School who was once targeted by Eric Harris, one of the Columbine gunmen.Brown and Harris became friends before the April 20,1999 shootings at the high school.In one letter dated June 12, 1999, Kristin wrote, \"As someone who has been rejected, victimized and ostracized in their life, I would like to thank you for giving him (Eric) that chance.\"She went on to write, \"Thank you for not judging and for accepting Eric and Dylan who were, from what I have heard, rejected and victimized by so many others. Thank you so much. Sincerely, Kristin.\"In another letter dated July 14, 1999, she wrote, \"... you felt like everyone hates you. Words could never tell you how sorry I am that you feel like anyone hates you. It completely baffles me as to why anyone would hate someone when they don't know them, it sickens me.\"Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said that Kristin died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Her sister, Candace survived after shooting herself. She remains in serious condition at Swedish Medical Center.Her family released this statement Friday afternoon, \"Our family would like to say thank you for the outpouring of support and concern shown during this past week. This is an extremely difficult time for our family. We would especially like to thank the Arapahoe County Sherriff's office for their diligence and perseverance in determining the facts and circumstances of this situation. We are also grateful to the paramedics who responded and assisted our daughters.\"Ernest and Kelsay Hermeler also requested privacy.The Hermeler twins were at the Family Shooting Center inside Cherry Creek State Park on Monday and were shooting for an hour and a half before the incident. The details of what exactly happened have been unclear until now because the surviving twin has been unable to communicate clearly to deputies what happened.On Thursday she was able to share the fact that the sisters had planned to commit suicide together and \"did in fact shoot themselves,\" according to authorities.The sisters had been at the shooting range for lessons. Investigators believe they carefully planned out what was to be their final moments.\"In reality they walked in that gate right there just as jovial and smiling and talking to each other like a couple of gals out on a field trip,\" said shooting range owner Doug Hamilton.Because each woman turned the gun on herself, not the other, investigators said no crime was committed.\"Her demeanor was somewhat defensive which I believe any of us would. She is here in a foreign country being interviewed by law enforcement,\" said Captain Louie Perea.\"But she was willing to speak with us and did speak with us for some length of time.\"The case has attracted international attention, bringing reporters from Australia to Colorado.\"In the beginning it has been a real mystery case, a puzzle that everyone has been quite intrigued in as the days have developed,\" said Emma Dallimore an Australian TV reporter who recently arrived to cover the story. \"It just seems more and more to be a very tragic story.\"\"Based on the physical evidence collected, the surviving sister's statements, and video surveillance footage from the shooting center the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office believes that this incident was indeed a suicide and attempted suicide,\" the sheriff's department wrote in a prepared statement.Officials said they are not releasing the video surveillance footage obtained from the shooting range. \n \n (\u00a9 MMX CBS Television Stations, Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.) ||||| The Hermeler twins' interest in Columbine High School grew from their experience as victims of bullying, as suggested by their phone calls and 11-year-old letters to a Columbine survivor. \n \n Kristin Hermeler, the 29-year-old sister who committed suicide Monday at an Arapahoe County gun range, called herself \"someone who has been rejected, victimized and ostracized\" in a letter to Columbine survivor Brooks Brown. \n \n \"I just wanted to write to you and let you know that not a day goes by that I do not think about what happened,\" she wrote in a letter dated July 14, 1999. \n \n A month earlier she wrote, \"I am completely shattered by what happened.\" \n \n Her sister, Candice, survived the .22-caliber bullet she fired into the \n \n Kristin's Letters Click for larger versions. \n \n center of her forehead at the same instant her sister killed herself. \n \n The existence of the letters was first reported by News4. \n \n Connecting to Columbine \n \n \"It was a very sweet letter, very sad,\" Brooks Brown told The Denver Post by telephone Saturday. \"It was her wanting to know why it happened, trying to understand.\" \n \n Brooks Brown said they made contact by phone, letters and e-mail \u2014 but not for many years. \n \n He said Kristin told him she and her sister had been bullied \"physically and mentally.\" \n \n Judy Brown, Brooks' mother, spoke to both twins at length on the phone in 1999. On Saturday, she recalled how sensitive and sympathetic the two girls were. \n \n At the time, the twins were 18 years old. \n \n \"It never goes away,\" Judy Brown said. \"Bullying changes who you are and who you become.\" \n \n During their visit to Colorado, which began a few months ago, the twins never contacted the Browns. \n \n Why the women decided to commit suicide together at the Family Shooting Center remains a mystery, and so far the surviving twin has refused to discuss the reason with investigators. \n \n Angry and distraught during the investigators' two-hour bedside interview Thursday, she denied any interest in Columbine, despite a photocopy of a May 1999 Time magazine cover that depicts shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris that was found among the twins' belongings. \n \n \"I don't give a (expletive),\" Candice said, according to police. \"It happened a long time ago.\" \n \n About a year before the Columbine massacre, Brooks Brown had been subjected to personal and online threats by eventual shooter Harris, to the point that his parents contacted law enforcement and America Online. But eventually the two had made peace \u2014 to the point that, according to a May 10, 1999, Time magazine article, Brooks Brown told his parents in early April that Harris had \"grown up\" and become \"a new Eric.\" \n \n On April 20, 1999, Brooks Brown came across Harris in the school parking lot just minutes before the shooting. Harris was pulling a bag of materiel from his car, which, unknown to Brown, contained explosives. \n \n \"Brooks, I like you,\" Harris told him. \"Now get out of here. Go home.\" \n \n Brooks left. Minutes later, 15 people, including Harris and Klebold, were dead or dying. Another 23 were wounded. \n \n The killings sparked national debates about the influence of guns, music, video games and TV and movie violence. It also led to a new focus on the dangers of high school cliques and bullying. \n \n Grappling with pact \n \n Candice remained in serious condition Saturday evening at Swedish Medical Center in Englewood. Her parents arrived in Denver on Friday and have asked reporters to respect their privacy. \n \n Hospital spokeswoman Karen Prestia would not discuss whether Candice Hermeler is on a suicide-prevention watch, or what kind of treatment she is receiving. \n \n Barb Mettler, chairwoman of the Suicide Prevention Coalition of Colorado, said people like Candice are likely to try to \"complete the mission.\" \n \n She's not surprised the twins seemed so normal the day they intended to die. \n \n \"Once the decision has been made to commit suicide, things become normal \u2014 that decision becomes normal to that person,\" she said. \n \n \"They're not doing it because they want to kill themselves; they're doing it because they want the pain to stop, the emotional pain and sometimes the physical pain.\" \n \n Outwardly the twins seemed to have little reason to want to die. Attractive, educated and well-traveled, they came from a privileged background with, by all accounts, loving, supportive parents. \n \n \"It cuts across all demographics, genders, all economic situations,\" Mettler said of suicide. \n \n As unusual as twins in a suicide pact might seem, it's also understandable, said Mettler, who is also a counselor at Spanish Peaks Mental Health Center in Pueblo. \n \n \"It's much like a mother who kills her children and commits suicide, because she's convinced no one else can care for her children,\" she said. \"Twins are so connected that they think no one else could understand them, and one couldn't go on without the other. It's a little like the idea that 'We came in together, we'll go out together.' \" \n \n Final minutes at the range \n \n Investigators and gun-range staff said the twins had gone to the range twice before. \n \n Monday afternoon, they took a Yellow Cab from their motel 6 miles away to the shooting range. \n \n They rented two pistols, a revolver and a semiautomatic, for $20 each and began to fire away at targets in lane No. 13 at the outdoor range, chatting with others, even borrowing an overcoat from another shooter when a gloomy cold front moved in Monday afternoon. \n \n At 2:52 p.m., they decided it was time to die, after placing the borrowed coat on a table. \n \n Fifteen-year-old Will Gwaltney and his father, Bill, a shooting instructor, were in the next lane. \n \n Efforts to reach the Gwaltneys on Saturday were unsuccessful. \n \n On Friday, Bill Gwaltney told the Herald Sun newspaper of Melbourne, Australia, that his son shouted, and he saw one of the twins writhing on the ground. Will called out, \"There's a problem, there's a problem!\" and his dad began CPR. \n \n With blood in her hair and bulging eyes, Candice sat back on her feet, unresponsive, according to investigators. \n \n \"It's a difficult feeling,\" Bill Gwaltney said. \"You wish you could have prevented it, but nobody knew it was coming.\" \n \n Joey Bunch: 303-954-1174 \n \n or jbunch@denverpost.com",

The firms often do not know who exactly is hiring them; the request could come from a law firm acting on behalf of a client from one of the parties. \n \n In this case, the request for opposition research on Donald Trump came from one of his Republican opponents in the primary campaign. The research firm then hired one of its sub-contractors who it used regularly on all things Russian: a retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow\u2019s spooks and siloviki (securocrats). \n \n Explainer: what is in the Trump-Russia dossier John McCain passed to the FBI? Read more \n \n By the time the contractor had started his research, however, the Republican primary was over. The original client had dropped out, but the firm that had hired him had found a new, Democratic client. This was not necessarily the Hillary Clinton campaign or the Democratic National Committee. Opposition research is frequently financed by wealthy individuals who have donated all they can and are looking for other ways to help. \n \n By July, the counter-intelligence contractor had collected a significant amount of material based on Russian sources who he had grown to trust over the years \u2013 not just in Moscow, but also among oligarchs living in the west. He delivered his reports, but the gravity of their contents weighed on him. If the allegations were real, their implications were overwhelming. \n \n He delivered a set to former colleagues in the FBI, whose counter-intelligence division would be the appropriate body to investigate. It is believed he also passed a copy to his own country\u2019s intelligence service, but it felt constrained in what action it could take and left it up to the Americans to do their own investigation and draw their own conclusions. \n \n As summer turned to autumn, the investigator was asked for more information by the FBI but heard nothing back about any investigation. The bureau seemed obsessed instead with classified material that flowed through a private email server set up by Clinton\u2019s aides. The FBI\u2019s director, James Comey, threw the election into a spin 11 days before the vote by announcing his investigators were examining newly discovered material. \n \n The former intelligence official grew concerned that there was a cover-up in progress. On a trip to New York in October, he was persuaded to tell his story to David Corn, the Washington editor of Mother Jones, who first reported the existence of the material on 31 October. \n \n The FBI however continued to refuse to comment on the issue, despite reports that it had requested and perhaps acquired a warrant for further investigation from the Foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court. The silence was not altogether surprising. The FBI counter-intelligence division, headquartered in Washington, is extremely secretive, much more so than the New York field office, which had strong links to former prosecutor and mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was by then working for Trump. The threat of leaks from New York about Clinton emails had reportedly pushed Comey into making his October surprise announcement. \n \n Donald Trump press conference: Russia allegations something 'Nazi Germany' would have done \u2013 live Read more \n \n In mid-November, the documents took another route into Washington that ultimately led to them being mentioned in the joint intelligence report on Russian interference that was delivered to President Obama and President-elect Trump. On 18 November, the annual Halifax International Security Forum opened in the Canadian city, bringing together serving and former security and foreign policy officials from around the world. \n \n Senator John McCain, a hawkish Republican, was there and was introduced to a former senior western diplomat who had seen the documents, knew their source and thought him highly reliable. McCain decided the implications were sufficiently alarming to dispatch a trusted emissary, a former US official, to meet the source and find out more. \n \n The emissary hastily arranged a transatlantic flight and met the source at the airport as arranged. (The Guardian has agreed not to specify the city or country where the meeting took place.) The meeting had a certain cold war tradecraft to it, as he was told to look for a man with a copy of the Financial Times. Having found each other, the retired counter-intelligence officer drove the emissary to his house, where they discussed the documents and their background. \n \n The emissary flew back within 24 hours and showed McCain the documents, saying it was hard to impossible to verify them without a proper investigation. McCain said he was reluctant to get involved, lest it be perceived as payback for insulting remarks Trump had made about him during his rambunctious campaign. \n \n However, on 9 December, McCain arranged a one-on-one meeting with Comey, with no aides present, and handed them over. \n \n BuzzFeed publishes unsubstantiated Trump report, raising ethics questions Read more \n \n \u201cUpon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue,\u201d the senator said in a statement on Wednesday morning. \n \n It is not clear what underpinned the FBI\u2019s decision to include a summary of the documents in its highly classified briefing to the president and president-elect and their top staff, before the bureau had completed its investigation. It may have been as a defensive measure, to prove for posterity that it was not involved in a cover-up, or because its investigators believed them to be credible. \n \n Whatever the motive, it was quickly leaked \u2013 first to CNN, which reported on the material on Wednesday. That triggered a controversial decision by BuzzFeed to publish an unredacted version of the documents on its website. It is unclear where the BuzzFeed version came from. The author of the reports had been insistent on blotting out references to his Russian sources in the copies he gave to the press, out of fear for their safety. The unredacted version could have come from the original client, who commissioned the research, or from intermediaries between the counter-intelligence contractor and the client. ||||| In January 1961, Dwight Eisenhower delivered his farewell address after serving two terms as U.S. president; the five-star general chose to warn Americans of this specific threat to democracy: \u201cIn the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\u201d That warning was issued prior to the decadelong escalation of the Vietnam War, three more decades of Cold War mania, and the post-9/11 era, all of which radically expanded that unelected faction\u2019s power even further. This is the faction that is now engaged in open warfare against the duly elected and already widely disliked president-elect, Donald Trump. They are using classic Cold War dirty tactics and the defining ingredients of what has until recently been denounced as \u201cFake News.\u201d Their most valuable instrument is the U.S. media, much of which reflexively reveres, serves, believes, and sides with hidden intelligence officials. And Democrats, still reeling from their unexpected and traumatic election loss, as well as a systemic collapse of their party, seemingly divorced further and further from reason with each passing day, are willing \u2014 eager \u2014 to embrace any claim, cheer any tactic, align with any villain, regardless of how unsupported, tawdry, and damaging those behaviors might be. The serious dangers posed by a Trump presidency are numerous and manifest. There is a wide array of legitimate and effective tactics for combating those threats: from bipartisan congressional coalitions and constitutional legal challenges to citizen uprisings and sustained and aggressive civil disobedience. All of those strategies have periodically proven themselves effective in times of political crisis or authoritarian overreach. But cheering for the CIA and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the U.S. election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected president is both warped and self-destructive. Empowering the very entities that have produced the most shameful atrocities and systemic deceit over the last six decades is desperation of the worst kind. Demanding that evidence-free, anonymous assertions be instantly venerated as Truth \u2014 despite emanating from the very precincts designed to propagandize and lie \u2014 is an assault on journalism, democracy, and basic human rationality. And casually branding domestic adversaries who refuse to go along as traitors and disloyal foreign operatives is morally bankrupt and certain to backfire on those doing it. Beyond all that, there is no bigger favor that Trump opponents can do for him than attacking him with such lowly, shabby, obvious shams, recruiting large media outlets to lead the way. When it comes time to expose actual Trump corruption and criminality, who is going to believe the people and institutions who have demonstrated they are willing to endorse any assertions no matter how factually baseless, who deploy any journalistic tactic no matter how unreliable and removed from basic means of ensuring accuracy? All of these toxic ingredients were on full display yesterday as the Deep State unleashed its tawdriest and most aggressive assault yet on Trump: vesting credibility in and then causing the public disclosure of a completely unvetted and unverified document, compiled by a paid, anonymous operative while he was working for both GOP and Democratic opponents of Trump, accusing Trump of a wide range of crimes, corrupt acts, and salacious private conduct. The reaction to all of this illustrates that while the Trump presidency poses grave dangers, so, too, do those who are increasingly unhinged in their flailing, slapdash, and destructive attempts to undermine it. For months, the CIA, with unprecedented clarity, overtly threw its weight behind Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and sought to defeat Donald Trump. In August, former acting CIA Director Michael Morell announced his endorsement of Clinton in the New York Times and claimed that \u201cMr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.\u201d The CIA and NSA director under George W. Bush, Gen. Michael Hayden, also endorsed Clinton and went to the Washington Post to warn, in the week before the election, that \u201cDonald Trump really does sound a lot like Vladimir Putin,\u201d adding that Trump is \u201cthe useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited.\u201d It is not hard to understand why the CIA preferred Clinton over Trump. Clinton was critical of Obama for restraining the CIA\u2019s proxy war in Syria and was eager to expand that war, while Trump denounced it. Clinton clearly wanted a harder line than Obama took against the CIA\u2019s long-standing foes in Moscow, while Trump wanted improved relations and greater cooperation. In general, Clinton defended and intended to extend the decadeslong international military order on which the CIA and Pentagon\u2019s preeminence depends, while Trump \u2014 through a still-uncertain mix of instability and extremist conviction \u2014 posed a threat to it. Whatever one\u2019s views are on those debates, it is the democratic framework \u2014 the presidential election, the confirmation process, congressional leaders, judicial proceedings, citizen activism and protest, civil disobedience \u2014 that should determine how they are resolved. All of those policy disputes were debated out in the open; the public heard them; and Trump won. Nobody should crave the rule of Deep State overlords. Yet craving Deep State rule is exactly what prominent Democratic operatives and media figures are doing. Any doubt about that is now dispelled. Just last week, Chuck Schumer issued a warning to Trump, telling Rachel Maddow that Trump was being \u201creally dumb\u201d by challenging the unelected intelligence community because of all the ways they possess to destroy those who dare to stand up to them: \n \n Chuck Schumer on Trump's tweet hitting intel community: \"He's being really dumb to do this.\" https://t.co/MOcU8ruOPK \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 4, 2017 \n \n And last night, many Democrats openly embraced and celebrated what was, so plainly, an attempt by the Deep State to sabotage an elected official who had defied it: ironically, its own form of blackmail. Back in October, a political operative and former employee of the British intelligence agency MI6 was being paid by Democrats to dig up dirt on Trump (before that, he was paid by anti-Trump Republicans). He tried to convince countless media outlets to publish a long memo he had written filled with explosive accusations about Trump\u2019s treason, business corruption, and sexual escapades, with the overarching theme that Trump was in servitude to Moscow because they were blackmailing and bribing him. Despite how many had it, no media outlets published it. That was because these were anonymous claims unaccompanied by any evidence at all, and even in this more permissive new media environment, nobody was willing to be journalistically associated with it. As the New York Times\u2019 Executive Editor Dean Baquet put it last night, he would not publish these \u201ctotally unsubstantiated\u201d allegations because \u201cwe, like others, investigated the allegations and haven\u2019t corroborated them, and we felt we\u2019re not in the business of publishing things we can\u2019t stand by.\u201d The closest this operative got to success was convincing Mother Jones\u2019s David Corn to publish an October 31 article reporting that \u201ca former senior intelligence officer for a Western country\u201d claims that \u201che provided the [FBI] with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump.\u201d But because this was just an anonymous claim unaccompanied by any evidence or any specifics (which Corn withheld), it made very little impact. All of that changed yesterday. Why? What changed was the intelligence community\u2019s resolution to cause this all to become public and to be viewed as credible. In December, John McCain provided a copy of this report to the FBI and demanded they take it seriously. At some point last week, the chiefs of the intelligence agencies decided to declare that this ex-British intelligence operative was \u201ccredible\u201d enough that his allegations warranted briefing both Trump and Obama about them, thus stamping some sort of vague, indirect, and deniable official approval on these accusations. Someone \u2014 by all appearances, numerous officials \u2014 then went to CNN to tell the network they had done this, causing CNN to go on air and, in the gravest of tones, announce the \u201cBreaking News\u201d that \u201cthe nation\u2019s top intelligence officials\u201d briefed Obama and Trump that Russia had compiled information that \u201ccompromised President-elect Trump.\u201d CNN refused to specify what these allegations were on the ground that it could not \u201cverify\u201d them. But with this document in the hands of multiple media outlets, it was only a matter of time \u2014 a small amount of time \u2014 before someone would step up and publish the whole thing. BuzzFeed quickly obliged, airing all of the unvetted, anonymous claims about Trump. Its editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, published a memo explaining that decision, saying that \u2014 although there was \u201cserious reason to doubt the allegations\u201d \u2014 BuzzFeed in general \u201cerrs on the side of publication\u201d and \u201cAmericans can make up their own minds about the allegations.\u201d Publishing this document predictably produced massive traffic (and thus profit) for the site, with millions of people viewing the article and presumably reading the \u201cdossier.\u201d One can certainly object to BuzzFeed\u2019s decision and, as the New York Times noted this morning, many journalists are doing so. It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine a scenario where it\u2019s justifiable for a news outlet to publish a totally anonymous, unverified, unvetted document filled with scurrilous and inflammatory allegations about which its own editor-in-chief says there \u201cis serious reason to doubt the allegations,\u201d on the ground that they want to leave it to the public to decide whether to believe it. But even if one believes there is no such case where that is justified, yesterday\u2019s circumstances presented the most compelling scenario possible for doing this. Once CNN strongly hinted at these allegations, it left it to the public imagination to conjure up the dirt Russia allegedly had to blackmail and control Trump. By publishing these accusations, BuzzFeed ended that speculation. More importantly, it allowed everyone to see how dubious this document is, one the CIA and CNN had elevated into some sort of grave national security threat. Almost immediately after it was published, the farcical nature of the \u201cdossier\u201d manifested. Not only was its author anonymous, but he was paid by Democrats (and, before that, by Trump\u2019s GOP adversaries) to dig up dirt on Trump. Worse, he himself cited no evidence of any kind but instead relied on a string of other anonymous people in Russia he claims told him these things. Worse still, the document was filled with amateur errors. While many of the claims are inherently unverified, some can be confirmed. One such claim \u2014 that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen secretly traveled to Prague in August to meet with Russian officials \u2014 was strongly denied by Cohen, who insisted he had never been to Prague in his life (Prague is the same place that foreign intelligence officials claimed, in 2001, was the site of a nonexistent meeting between Iraqi officials and 9/11 hijackers, which contributed to 70 percent of Americans believing, as late as the fall of 2003, that Saddam personally planned the 9/11 attack). This morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that \u201cthe FBI has found no evidence that [Cohen] traveled to the Czech Republic.\u201d None of this stopped Democratic operatives and prominent media figures from treating these totally unverified and unvetted allegations as grave revelations.

The Washington Post reported that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, apparently by Russian government agents, and a mysterious figure calling himself \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d began to publish the stolen documents online. \n \n Mr. Simpson hired Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer with whom he had worked before. Mr. Steele, in his early 50s, had served undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s and later was the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s spy service, MI6. When he stepped down in 2009, he started his own commercial intelligence firm, Orbis Business Intelligence. \n \n The former journalist and the former spy, according to people who know them, had similarly dark views of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. officer, and the varied tactics he and his intelligence operatives used to smear, blackmail or bribe their targets. \n \n As a former spy who had carried out espionage inside Russia, Mr. Steele was in no position to travel to Moscow to study Mr. Trump\u2019s connections there. Instead, he hired native Russian speakers to call informants inside Russia and made surreptitious contact with his own connections in the country as well. \n \n Mr. Steele wrote up his findings in a series of memos, each a few pages long, that he began to deliver to Fusion GPS in June and continued at least until December. By then, the election was over, and neither Mr. Steele nor Mr. Simpson was being paid by a client, but they did not stop what they believed to be very important work. (Mr. Simpson declined to comment for this article, and Mr. Steele did not immediately reply to a request for comment.) \n \n The memos described two different Russian operations. The first was a yearslong effort to find a way to influence Mr. Trump, perhaps because he had contacts with Russian oligarchs whom Mr. Putin wanted to keep track of. According to Mr. Steele\u2019s memos, it used an array of familiar tactics: the gathering of \u201ckompromat,\u201d compromising material such as alleged tapes of Mr. Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, and proposals for business deals attractive to Mr. Trump. \n \n The goal would probably never have been to make Mr. Trump a knowing agent of Russia, but to make him a source who might provide information to friendly Russian contacts. But if Mr. Putin and his agents wanted to entangle Mr. Trump using business deals, they did not do it very successfully. Mr. Trump has said he has no major properties there, though one of his sons said at a real estate conference in 2008 that \u201ca lot of money\u201d was \u201cpouring in from Russia.\u201d ||||| Democrats have resisted openly questioning Donald Trump\u2019s legitimacy as the next president \u2014 despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s efforts to get him elected, now acknowledged by Trump himself. \n \n But the party is finding it increasingly difficult to hold back. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Democrats are struggling with how far to go in exploiting Trump\u2019s Russia troubles for political gain \u2014 wary of prolonging election-year acrimony and undermining confidence in American democracy, but tempted to try to maximize their chances of making Trump a one-term president. \n \n The dilemma was heightened by this week\u2019s explosive reports about Russia possibly obtaining compromising information on Trump, which he flatly denied at a news conference Wednesday. Where the party ends up could say a lot about how Democrats intend to mount a comeback from their shocking defeat at Trump\u2019s hands in November. \n \n For now, at least, they\u2019re trying to straddle a middle ground, saying it\u2019s up to Trump to prove his legitimacy with his own actions. That means backing stronger sanctions against Russia and allowing a full investigation into its apparent election meddling instead of bashing U.S. intelligence agencies and lavishing praise on Russian leader Putin. \n \n \u201cIt casts a shadow over the presidency,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said in an interview. While Russia\u2019s cyber-intrusion into the election \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the outcome of the Electoral College,\u201d he added, it does demonstrate that \u201cthere is no mandate for Trump\u2019s vision or policies for America. He lost the popular vote \u2014 that\u2019s the citizens\u2019 vote \u2014 by a huge margin.\u201d \n \n Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) was more direct in his challenge to Trump\u2019s \u201cbizarre and so otherwise inexplicable\u201d refusal to agree with the intelligence community\u2019s findings that Russia mounted a campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the White House. \n \n \u201cWhat is the nature of your compulsion to deny and to avoid this conversation?\u201d Connolly said he would like to ask Trump. He warned Republicans who have sidestepped Trump\u2019s friendliness toward Russia that \u201cyou put yourself at great peril depending on subsequent facts\u201d by embracing any \u201crationalization of this Russian interference and possible troubling relationship between the president-elect and Putin.\u201d \n \n So far, House Democrats are more willing than their Senate counterparts to assert that Trump\u2019s presidential victory has lost credibility due to Russian meddling. Even before Trump\u2019s Russia troubles deepened late Tuesday, two members of House Democratic leadership wryly nicknamed him \u201cMoscow Donald\u201d during a news conference. \n \n \u201cThis was the most un-American election ever,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which oversees human rights in the region. \n \n If Trump commits to \u201cstronger sanctions\u201d against Russia, Cohen added, \u201cI think people would feel comfortable that he would put America first. It would maybe limit people\u2019s concerns that there was a relationship with Russia that was unhealthy that we don\u2019t know about. People think Putin had something on him.\u201d \n \n California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who\u2019s helped lead a Democratic push for an independent commission to investigate Russian hacking, said lawmakers should not worry about appearing to try to invalidate the results of the election because there is no evidence that Trump\u2019s campaign coordinated with Russia. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that, if you acknowledge it, you\u2019re putting an asterisk on our president-elect, and that\u2019s really a short-sighted way of looking at this,\u201d Swalwell said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s only an asterisk if there was any collaboration.\u201d \n \n Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have called for further investigation into links between Trump emissaries and Russia, however. FBI Director James Comey said during Senate testimony Tuesday that he could neither confirm nor deny a probe of alleged coordination between Trump allies and Russia. \n \n \u201cHe can legitimize himself by being forthcoming about his global interests,\u201d Swalwell said, reviving long-running Democratic insistence that Trump follow presidential precedent and release his tax returns. \n \n Senior Democrats are renewing their push for an independent, bipartisan commission to probe Russia\u2019s meddling following the revelation, first reported by CNN, that U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump on Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to collect compromising information on him. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that Trump\u2019s friendliness toward Russia is \u201ceven more worrisome\u201d in light of the reports, acknowledging they remain uncorroborated. \n \n \u201cThe allegation that an American president could be susceptible to blackmail by a hostile foreign government is historic and deeply troubling,\u201d Durbin said in a statement. \u201cIt makes the resistance of Republican leaders in the Senate and House to a fulsome investigation all the more inexplicable.\u201d \n \n Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen says Russia's preference for Donald Trump in the November election is not in dispute. | AP Photo \n \n Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), chairman of Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign committee, said in a Tuesday interview before the CNN report that while \u201cit\u2019s unknowable to what extent Russian interference affected the outcome\u201d of the election, Moscow\u2019s preference for Trump isn\u2019t in dispute. \n \n \u201cWhat we do know is they were working hard to elect Donald Trump and try to disqualify Hillary Clinton, and that means it\u2019s really important that we not only shine a light on what happened,\u201d Van Hollen said, \u201cbut that we protect our electoral system and we sanction the Russians.\u201d \n \n Several Democrats steered clear of questioning Trump\u2019s validity. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of several Democrats who joined four Republican senators Tuesday on a new Russia sanctions bill, said the Putin regime\u2019s involvement in the election was critical \u2014 not what that involvement says about Trump\u2019s victory. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t even pass an opinion on whether it affected the legitimacy of his election,\u201d Menendez said. \n \n Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) offered a road map for his party\u2019s messaging efforts, blaming Trump for putting his own legitimacy at risk by resisting intelligence reports and underscoring Democrats\u2019 interest in a bipartisan process. \n \n \u201cWhat undermines the incoming president is his unwillingness to agree with the intelligence community,\u201d Schatz said in an interview. \u201cThere are very few serious members of Congress who are using this to question the legitimacy of the president-elect, but there are very many people on both sides who want to get to the bottom of this \u2014 not for the purpose of re-litigating 2016, but for the purpose of protecting our republic.\u201d ||||| President-elect Donald Trump says allegations made about him in an unverified dossier prepared by ex-British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, are completely fabricated.

The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources.

The former official, who is now a private investigator, says he passed the dossier to the FBI because he feared there was a cover-up in the agency's investigation of alleged Russian hacking during the election. According to the New York Times, Mother Jones first reported the existence of the dossier on Oct. 31, the same day FBI Director James Comey announced the bureau was looking into newly discovered material on Hillary Clinton \u2013 The revelation that the FBI was investigating possible ties between Russia and members of Donald Trump's campaign just 11 days before the election is raising more questions than it answers. The Guardian reports that FBI chief James Comey first raised the possibility of a cover-up in October when he went to New York to tell the Washington editor of Mother Jones that investigators were looking into a series of emails that a former intelligence official had found on a laptop.

Here's what people are saying: At the Daily Beast, Adam Serwer writes that the dossier \"proves everyone's worst fears\": that Trump colluded with the Kremlin to sway the election. He notes that the allegations in the dossier\u2014that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Russian officials in August\u2014are \"inherently unverified\" and \"filled with amateur errors,\" but he says they're still \u2013 The New York Times is out with a bombshell story about an ex-British spy's allegations that the Kremlin worked with Donald Trump's lawyers to set up a meeting between Trump and a Russian lawyer promising damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The story is based on memos written by Christopher Steele, a former MI6 spy, and delivered to a business intelligence firm called Fusion GPS.

    "document": "After months of waiting for Donald Trump\u2019s decline, Republican insiders now concede the poll leader could take two of the first four early voting states, though they caution his hold on Iowa is weak. \n \n That\u2019s according to the POLITICO Caucus, our weekly poll of the top strategists, operatives and activists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n For this Thanksgiving holiday week, POLITICO analyzed seven months-worth of responses to our weekly benchmark question: Who would win your state if the voting were today? The result offers a snapshot of the current state of primary play \u2014 with Trump, Cruz, and Rubio grappling for wins in the early states \u2014 and chronicles Republicans\u2019 slow acceptance of the real estate mogul as a contender with staying power. \n \n Roughly three-in-four GOP insiders in New Hampshire and South Carolina, many of whom have been repeatedly and consistently skeptical of Trump\u2019s chances, now say he would win their states if their primaries were held today. \n \n \u201cFor the first time, I think the Trump phenomenon is becoming real,\u201d a South Carolina Republican said. \n \n \u201cI do not think the media or the party establishment have a real grasp on how deep the anger and frustration is around the country,\u201d that insider said when most recently surveyed last week. \u201cAfter what have been \u2018missteps\u2019 by Trump in comparison of previous elections, he seems to have only strengthened. I still do not know if he can sustain it into the New Year \u2014 but after the Paris attacks, his stance on illegal immigration and unverified people coming into our nation has real impact.\u201d \n \n But his hold on Iowa and Nevada is more tenuous, according to insiders who note those states\u2019 caucuses require significant organizational muscle to produce a win. \n \n GOP insiders now have Cruz nudging Trump out of the lead in Iowa. That prediction came even before a Quinnipiac University poll this week showed the Texan running neck and neck with Trump. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson was the only other candidate to register significantly on this question. It\u2019s the first time Cruz has led on this measure \u2014 after months of Trump and, briefly, Carson in front. \n \n \u201cI remain skeptical that Donald Trump's organization could turn out enough supporters today to win, and Ben Carson is fading on growing concerns that he's simply not up for the job,\u201d said an Iowa Republican. \u201cCruz has been building \u2014 and continues to build \u2014 a solid organization. I'm not saying it won't change, although I've thought for some time now that Ted Cruz will win the Iowa caucuses \u2014 but this is the first week I'd put him on top in Iowa.\u201d \n \n Still, the third of Iowa insiders who said Trump would win insisted he has built the campaign infrastructure to turn out his voters, even if they aren\u2019t traditional caucus-goers. \u201cTrump still has the best ground game and organization in the state,\u201d one insider said. \n \n In Nevada, insiders were divided between Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has an organization in the state built somewhat on his appeal among Mormon voters, who made up about a quarter of the electorate, according to entrance polls. Rubio has consistently polled second in Nevada among GOP insiders since The POLITICO Caucus expanded there in early October. \n \n \u201c[Rubio] continues to have the best structure in the state that will actually turn people out on caucus day,\u201d said one Nevada Republican. \n \n Trump wasn\u2019t always in such a dominating position. Before Trump entered the race in June, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who ended his campaign in September, was the odds-on favorite in neighboring Iowa: In weekly surveys from mid-April through the end of June, Walker was picked as the winner of the Iowa caucuses by more than 70 percent of Republican insiders. In New Hampshire, Bush was picked by two-thirds of insiders over the same time period. \n \n The Caucus expanded to South Carolina and Nevada in early October \u2014 well after Trump\u2019s surge to the top of the polls. But results have consistently shown Trump stronger in South Carolina \u2014 more than three-in-five insiders in October said he would win there at the time \u2014 than in Nevada, where only a plurality, about 45 percent, picked Trump. \n \n Democrats: Clinton reasserts commanding advantage over Sanders \n \n Hillary Clinton has stymied Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 summer surge, according to Democratic insiders in the same four early states surveyed by POLITICO. Insiders said overwhelmingly in all four states that Clinton would win if the caucuses or primaries were held today. \n \n While members of The POLITICO Caucus have always leaned more toward Clinton than the public opinion polls, Sanders had closed the gap \u2014 especially in New Hampshire \u2014 over the summer. In late June and early July, roughly a quarter of New Hampshire Caucus members said Sanders would win the first-in-the-nation primary there if it were held that day. \n \n But now only a handful of insiders say Sanders would win today in their states. \u201cHillary's organization in Nevada is large and very competent in its work preparing for our caucus,\u201d said one Democrat. \u201cBernie might actually be more popular among active Democrats.\u201d \n \n A small fraction of insiders said the fervor of Sanders\u2019 supporters will carry the day. \u201cSanders has a lot of working class support,\u201d said an Iowa Democrat. \u201cThe proof of his support, though, will be evident at the precinct caucuses.\u201d \n \n Back in New Hampshire, where Sanders had posted his strongest leads in the polls, Democratic insiders are convinced Clinton has halted Sanders\u2019 ascent. \n \n \u201cSanders has lost momentum,\u201d said one Democratic insider. \u201cThe race has become about more than income inequality, and his more limited focus/message \u2014 in contrast to Clinton's breadth and depth \u2014 has become a weakness. Also, as voters get more engaged and serious, the electability factor is also starting to become more important, helping Clinton [and] hurting Sanders.\u201d \n \n Another Democrat in New Hampshire was even more blunt, writing simply: \u201cIt is so over.\u201d ||||| WASHINGTON U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump's support among Republicans has dropped 12 points in less than a week, marking the real estate mogul's biggest decline since he vaulted to the top of the field in July, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. \n \n Trump was the favorite of 31 percent of Republicans in a rolling poll in the five days ended on Nov. 27. That was down from a peak of 43 percent registered on Nov. 22. \n \n The dip follows criticism of Trump for comments he made in the aftermath of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks that killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more. \n \n Following the attacks, Trump told an NBC News reporter that he would support requiring all Muslims within the United States to be registered to a special database, which his critics have likened to the mandatory registration of Jews in Nazi Germany. \n \n Trump has also been criticized for flailing his arms and distorting his speech as he mocked a New York Times reporter, Serge Kovaleski, who is disabled. \n \n Trump mocked the reporter as he defended his unsubstantiated assertion that during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, he watched on television as \"thousands and thousands\" of people in New Jersey cheered while the World Trade Center fell. \n \n Still, Trump is not the only front-runner to slide in the latest survey. \n \n Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has seen his poll numbers drift downward and now trails Trump by more than half, with just 15 percent of Republicans polled saying they would vote for him in the same Nov. 27 poll. As recently as late October, Carson trailed Trump by only six points. \n \n Following Carson, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz are tied for third place, with more than 8 percent each. \n \n Following Rubio and Cruz was former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with 7 percent. \n \n The five-day rolling average sample size ranged from 464 to 347 respondents between Nov. 22 and Nov. 27, with a credibility interval of 5.2 to 6.1 percentage points. \n \n For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

    "document": "Hail to the bubbly! No, literally -- hail has been falling all over grapes made to make champagne and it\u2019s cutting into the French output of the effervescent beverage. \n \n The champagne harvest is down 40 percent this year, leading to the worst yield in at least four decades, thanks to hail storms and fungus caused by wet weather, according to the French Agriculture Ministry, Businessweek reports. All over Europe, in fact, crops of grapes used to make wine have had a bad season this year, causing the total French grape harvest to decline by 20 percent, including in the well-known wine-producing regions of Burgundy and Bordeaux. Yields are also down in Italy and England. \n \n But despite the poor crops, champagne drinkers shouldn\u2019t worry that the low output will cut into their 2013 New Year\u2019s celebrations too much. Champagne takes at least 15 months to make and is often made from a mixture of grapes from harvests spanning several years so the long term effect isn\u2019t expected to be too drastic. In fact, producers have an at least three-year supply of champagne in reserve, Businessweek reports. \n \n Indeed, even with the shortages expected from this year, wine producers seem equipped to handle the decline since there\u2019s a surplus left over from waning demand in the U.S. and South America markets due to the recession, The Edmonton Journal reports. \n \n But demand for champagne appears to finally to be bouncing back after a three year lull, according to Harpers Wines. Last year, the U.S. champagne market grew 14.4 percent, Businessweek reports. ||||| France \n \n With its economy sliding into recession, France could use a bit of cheering up as the holiday season approaches. Instead, it got this news: The champagne harvest is down 40 percent this year, as vineyards were ravaged by hailstorms, wet weather, and fungus. \u201cThis is the lowest harvest in at least 40 years,\u201d the Agriculture Ministry said in reporting the figures on Nov. 9. \n \n Happily for champagne aficionados, there\u2019ll be no shortage for New Year\u2019s Eve. The bubbly stuff has to age a minimum 15 months in producers\u2019 cellars before being sold\u2014so the bottle you open on Dec. 31 won\u2019t come from this year\u2019s crop. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s more than a three-year supply of champagne in producers\u2019 vats, waiting to be bottled. Typically, champagne is made from a mixture of grapes from several years\u2019 harvests. \u201cWe built up reserves during the years when we had big harvests, which helps us deal with the caprices of nature,\u201d says Thibaut le Mailloux, a spokesman for the French champagne producers association, known as the CIVC. \n \n Unhappily for French producers, they have another problem. Their countrymen are drinking less champagne\u2014and France accounts for about half of global sales. French champagne sales fell 2 percent in 2011, including an 8 percent year-on-year drop during the Christmas and New Year holiday season. At the time, the CIVC said the decline was a \u201ctemporary effect\u201d from the European debt crisis. But the crisis has continued, and the French economy has worsened this year, with three quarters of flat growth and unemployment now at a 13-year high of more than 10 percent. \u201cFrance is not really in a festive mood,\u201d says Laetitia Delay, a beverage analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Paris. \n \n Major producers such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY)\u2014whose champagne brands include Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, Krug, and Veuve\u2014have cushioned themselves against the downturn by exporting. Even as French sales dropped, the U.S. champagne market grew 14.4 percent in 2011 while China was up 19 percent. But smaller producers are suffering, Delay says. Adding to the woe, some distributors are lowering prices to clear their inventories. Says Delay: \u201cThat\u2019s very bad for the image of champagne.\u201d",

Lawmakers often battle with agencies but the fights mostly stay above board and focus on policy, rather than descending into leaking private information. \n \n The report found that between March 24 and April 2, 2015, 45 Secret Service employees accessed \u201csensitive personal information\u201d on Chaffetz nearly 60 times. Only 4 of the 45 employees had \u201can arguable legitimate need to access the information,\u201d the report found. \n \n The IG also found that there was widespread dissemination of the personal information. \n \n Lowry, in one instance, emailed employees saying, \u201cSome information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz blasted the agency for the alleged leaks. \n \n \u201cCertain lines should never be crossed. The unauthorized access and distribution of my personal information crossed that line. It was a tactic designed to intimidate and embarrass me and frankly, it is intimidating,\u201d the Utah Republican said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think about all the possible dangers in having your personal information exposed.\u201d \n \n The Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the Secret Service earlier this year after a series of embarrassing security incidents at the White House. Chaffetz helped uncover reports that a knife-wielding man got much further into the White House than initially reported and that an armed man was allowed into an elevator with President Barack Obama. \n \n The panel is also investigating reports that Secret Service agents paid for sex during a presidential visit to Colombia \n \n Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the panel, said the Secret Service should issue an \u201cimmediate apology.\u201d \n \n \u201cAlthough the Inspector General identified no evidence of political motivation or influence, I believe in fundamental fairness, and those who are unwilling or unable to meet the highest of ethical standards should not be a part of the Secret Service,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \n \n Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said he takes \u201cemployee misconduct very seriously\u201d and will ensure the involved parties are punished. \n \n \u201cI again apologize to Representative Chaffetz for this wholly avoidable and embarrassing misconduct,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cAdditionally, I will continue to review policies and practices to address employee misconduct and demand the highest level of integrity of all our employees.\u201d \n \n ||||| Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Secret Service leaked private info to embarrass congressman 2:45 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n The Secret Service apologized Wednesday to Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a prominent critic of the agency, for violating federal privacy law by improperly accessing sensitive personal information about him dozens of times in little more than a single week. \n \n Chaffetz, R-Utah \u2014 who has aggressively pursued allegations of Secret Service misconduct as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform \u2014 called the unauthorized retrieval of his unsuccessful application to join the Secret Service in 2003 \"a tactic designed to intimidate and embarrass me.\" \n \n \"It's scary to think about all the possible dangers in having your personal information exposed,\" Chaffetz said in a statement late Wednesday afternoon. \"The work of the committee, however, will continue. I remain undeterred in conducting proper and rigorous oversight.\" \n \n Later, in a short interview with NBC News, the congressman reiterated how chilling the report was. \n \n \"It's a bit scary. If they would do this to me, I just, I shuddered to think what they might be doing to other people,\" he said. \"I'd like to tell you how tough I am, but it's scary, and it's intimidating, and I will continue to investigate the Secret Service and others, but this should have never ever happened.\" \n \n The improper handling of Chaffetz's personal information was confirmed Wednesday in a 29-page report by the inspector general's office of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Secret Service. \n \n Related: Read the Entire Inspector General's Report (PDF) \n \n The report discloses an email in which Ed Lowery, the agency's assistant director for training, wrote that \"some information that he might be find embarrassing needs to get out.\" \n \n The report says Roth told investigators he believed at the time that such disclosures would be \"inappropriate\" and explained that his email was a human reaction by someone frustrated by \"stress and ... anger.\" \n \n The report specifically said Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, whom President Barack Obama appointed in February to clean up a long series of scandals at the agency, was not aware of the improper behavior. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Scandals at the Secret Service Keep Piling Up 1:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n When these allegations first surfaced in April, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson referred them to the inspector general and apologized to Chaffetz. The report published Wednesday details the improper behavior and harshly criticizes the Secret Service for violating the Privacy Act of 1974. \n \n On Wednesday, the Secret Service issued a statement apologizing to Chaffetz for \"this wholly avoidable and embarrassing misconduct\" and promising that those responsible would be held accountable. \n \n The inspector general's report found that more than 40 Secret Service employees accessed Chaffetz's 2003 job application a total of more than 60 times, even though they had \"no official need to query Chairman Chaffetz' name.\" \n \n The first inquiry was made March 24 \u2014 just 18 minutes after Chaffetz opened a committee hearing into alleged Secret Service misconduct, the report says. \n \n Related: Long List of Breaches and Scandals for Secret Service Under Obama \n \n Over the next nine days, the job application was accessed about 60 more times, the report says, by employees in the public relations office, the countersurveillance division, the division overseeing protection for former President Bill Clinton, the training division and at least 15 domestic and overseas field offices. \n \n Only four of the inquiries could reasonably be considered justified, it says. \n \n At least one employee acknowledged to inspector general investigators that he disclosed the protected information to a reporter for The Washington Post, according to the report, and in a further violation of the Privacy Act, some of the employees disseminated Chaffetz's data through the Secret Service email system, it says. \n \n \"This episode reflects an obvious lack of care on the part of Secret Service personnel as to the sensitivity of the information entrusted to them,\" the report concluded. \"It doesn't take a lawyer explaining the nuances of the Privacy Act to know that the conduct that occurred here \u2014 by dozens of agents in every part of the agency \u2014 was wrong.\" \n \n Johnson, the homeland security secretary, said Wednesday that he had repeated his apology to Chaffetz and stressed that \"activities like those described in the report must not, and will not, be tolerated.\" \n \n But the report angered Chaffetz and other members of his committee, Democratic and Republican alike. \n \n \"It is intimidating,\" Chaffetz said. \"Certain lines should never be crossed. The unauthorized access and distribution of my personal information crossed that line.\" \n \n Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, chairman of the committee's panel on government operations, said the report revealed \"woeful abuse of power by a government agency tasked with one of the most important jobs in the country: protecting our nation's president.\" \n \n And Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement: \"I believe in fundamental fairness, and those who are unwilling or unable to meet the highest of ethical standards should not be a part of the Secret Service.\" ||||| An assistant director of the Secret Service urged that unflattering information the agency had in its files about a congressman \u00adcritical of the service should be made public, according to a government watchdog report released Wednesday. \n \n \u201cSome information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out,\u201d Assistant Director Edward Lowery wrote in an e-mail to a fellow director on March 31, commenting on an internal file that was being widely circulated inside the service. \u201cJust to be fair.\u201d \n \n Two days later, a news Web site reported that Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had applied to be a Secret Service agent in 2003 and been rejected. \n \n That information was part of a Chaffetz personnel file stored in a restricted Secret Service database and required by law to be kept private. \n \n [Secret Service officials allowed to participate in probe of leak by agency] \n \n The report by John Roth, inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, singled out Lowery, in part because of his senior position at the agency. The report also cited Lowery\u2019s e-mail as the one piece of documentary evidence showing the degree of anger inside the agency at Chaffetz and the desire for the information to be public. \n \n Lowery had been promoted to the post of assistant director for training just a month earlier as part of an effort that Secret Ser\u00advice Director Joseph Clancy said would reform the agency after a series of high-profile security lapses. Clancy had tapped Lowery to join a slate of new leaders he installed after removing more than two-thirds of the previous senior management team. \n \n During the inspector general\u2019s probe, Lowery denied to investigators that he directed anyone to leak the private information about Chaffetz to the press and said his e-mail was simply a vent for his stress and anger. \n \n The Chaffetz file, contained in the restricted database, had been peeked at by about 45 Secret Service agents, some of whom shared it with their colleagues in March and April, the report found. This prying began after a contentious March 24 House hearing at which Chaffetz scolded the director and the agency for its series of security gaffes and misconduct. The \u00adhearing sparked anger inside the \u00adagency. \n \n The inspector general\u2019s inquiry found that the Chaffetz information was spread to nearly every layer of the service. \n \n [Secret Service chief questioned over handling of White House incident] \n \n Staff members in the most senior headquarters offices, the president\u2019s protective detail, the public affairs office, the office of investigations, and field offices in Sacramento, Charlotte, Dallas and elsewhere accessed Chaffetz\u2019s file \u2014 and many acknowledged sharing it widely, according to the report. The day after the March 24 hearing, one agent who had been sent to New York for the visit of the president of Afghanistan recalled that nearly all of the 70 agents at a briefing were discussing it. \n \n All told, 18 supervisors, including assistant directors, the deputy director and even Clancy\u2019s chief of staff knew the information was being widely shared through agency offices, the report said. \n \n \u201cThese agents work for an agency whose motto \u2014 \u2018Worthy of trust and confidence\u2019 \u2014 is engraved in marble in the lobby of their headquarters building,\u201d Roth wrote in his summary report. \u201cFew could credibly argue that the agents involved in this episode lived up to this motto.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz issued this response Wednesday night in a statement to The Washington Post: \u201cCertain lines should never be crossed. The unauthorized access and distribution of my personal information crossed that line. It was a tactic designed to intimidate and embarrass me and frankly, it is intimidating. It\u2019s scary to think about all the possible dangers in having your personal information exposed. The work of the committee, however, will continue. I remain undeterred in conducting proper and rigorous oversight.\u201d \n \n Clancy said in an e-mailed statement earlier Wednesday: \u201cI have reviewed the DHS OIG Report and have provided additional information to the DHS IG. The Secret Service takes employee misconduct very seriously, and as I have stated before, any employee, regardless of rank or seniority, who has committed misconduct will be held accountable. This incident will be no different and I will ensure the appropriate disciplinary actions are taken. \n \n \u201cOn behalf of the men and women of the United States Secret Service, I again apologize to Representative Chaffetz for this wholly avoidable and embarrassing misconduct. Additionally, I will continue to review policies and practices to address employee misconduct and demand the highest level of integrity of all our employees.\u201d \n \n After reviewing the IG report, the oversight panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), said in a statement that he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by what Roth\u2019s team uncovered and that staffers who have shown themselves to be \u201cunwilling or unable to meet the highest ethical standards\u201d should leave the \u00adagency. \n \n \u201cChairman Chaffetz and I have worked together to help restore the Secret Service to its standing as the most elite protective agency in the world,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cToday\u2019s findings by the Inspector General go directly against this goal and are completely and utterly unacceptable and indefensible.\u201d \n \n DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, whose department includes the Secret Service, urged in a statement that those personnel who had engaged in inappropriate conduct should be held responsible. \n \n Roth said in his report that it was \u201cespecially ironic and troubling\u201d that the Chaffetz information circulated so widely inside the agency and yet Clancy did not know about it. Even Clancy chief of staff Michael Biermann and Deputy Director Craig Magaw had been privy to the information, the report said, but did not alert \u00adClancy. \n \n Clancy had previously raised concerns about the failure of his staff to keep him properly informed. At the March 24 hearing, he said he was \u201cinfuriated\u201d that he was not alerted by his senior management to an incident earlier that month in which two senior supervisors drove onto the White House complex after a night of drinking and crossed through an active bomb-investigation scene. \n \n \u201cHe testified that he was \u2018working furiously to try to break down these barriers where people feel that they can\u2019t talk up the chain,\u2019 \u201d Roth wrote. \u201cYet the Director himself did not know.\u201d \n \n Roth\u2019s investigation examined not only who accessed Chaffetz\u2019s personnel file inside the service but also who disclosed information about the file to the media. The Daily Beast first reported on April 2 that Chaffetz had once been rejected for a job at the service. The Post reported additional details later that evening. \n \n One official told The Post that the material included a parody poster that pictured Chaffetz leading a hearing on the Secret Service from his congressional dais, with the headline \u201cGot BQA from the Service in 2003.\u201d Within the Secret Service, \u201cBQA\u201d is an acronym meaning that a \u201cbetter qualified applicant\u201d was available. \n \n Roth\u2019s report said investigators were unable to pin down how The Post and the Daily Beast obtained their information. \u201cBecause of the significant number of individuals who had knowledge of Chairman Chaffetz\u2019s application history, we were unable to conclusively determine the universe of sources of the disclosure . . . to individuals outside of government,\u201d the report said. \n \n Roth himself has faced criticism over his handling of the investigation because he allowed inspectors from the Secret Service\u2019s internal affairs office to sit in on interviews and question some witnesses alongside his investigators. Legal experts and former government investigators have said the service\u2019s involvement was a potential conflict of interest because top officials at the agency had an incentive to embarrass Chaffetz. Experts also expressed concerns that it could deter internal whistleblowers from coming forward with additional allegations of misconduct, for fear of retribution by their bosses.",

The report says 45 Secret Service employees accessed \"sensitive personal information\" on the House Oversight Committee chairman nearly 60 times between March 24 and April 2, 2015, Politico reports. Only four of those employees had \"an arguable legitimate need\" to access the information, the report found. \"Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair,\" wrote Secret Service Assistant Director Edward Lowery in an email, per the Washington Post. The Post reports Lowery was the one who tried to leak the information to reporters.

The report doesn't find any evidence of political motivation, but Democrats including Rep. Elijah Cummings are calling for an \"immediate apology\" from Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy.

The report also found that at least one employee disclosed the sensitive information to a reporter, reports the Washington Post. \"This episode reflects an obvious lack of care on the part of Secret Service personnel as to the sensitivity of the information entrusted to them,\" the report states. \"It doesn't take a lawyer explaining the nuances of the Privacy Act to know that the conduct that occurred here\u2014by dozens of agents in every part of the agency\u2014was wrong.\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says he has apologized to the congressman and that \"activities like those described in the report must not, and will not, be tolerated.\" The Secret Service, meanwhile, issued a statement apologizing for \"this wholly avoidable and embarrassing misconduct\" and \u2013 \u201cSome information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out,\u201d Assistant Director Edward Lowery wrote in an email to a fellow director in March 2015. \u201cJust to be fair.\u201d That email and others like it were used to leak information about Rep.

According to her suit (PDF) in Kern County Superior Court: \n \n After researching the app and speaking with a trainer from Xora, Plaintiff and her co-workers asked whether Intermex would be monitoring their movements while off duty. Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she installed the app on her phone. Plaintiff expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion\u2026.. \n \n Intermex did not immediately respond for comment. \n \n The suit, which claims invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and other allegations, seeks damages in excess of $500,000 and asserts she was monitored on the weekends when she was not working. \n \n Arias' boss \"scolded\" her for uninstalling the app shortly after being required to use it, according to the suit.

(CN) - A money-transfer company fired an employee for refusing to install an app that would track her location even when she was off the clock, the woman claims in court. \n \n Myrna Arias sued Intermex Wire Transfer LLC in Kern County Superior Court on May 5. \n \n Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Intermex describes itself on its website as \" a leading processor of money-transfer services in the U.S. to Latin America corridor.\" \n \n It has 30,000 locations worldwide and offers services in 45 states and 16 Latin American countries, the website adds. \n \n Arias says she worked for Intermex as a sales executive and account manager from February 2014 to May 2014. \n \n She was still working for rival NetSpend Corporation when she was hired. Her boss, Intermex's regional vice president of sales John Stubits, agreed to let her work for both NetSpend and Intermex for three months until she qualified for Intermex's medical insurance because she was suffering from a severe vitamin B-12 deficiency and did not want to lose her treatment, according to the complaint. \n \n Arias says she did well at her job, meeting all her quotas and earning around $7,250 a month. \n \n But everything changed in April 2014, when she claims Stubits told her and several other employees to download an app from Xora onto their smartphones that \"contained a global positioning system function which tracked the exact location of the person possessing the smartphones on which it was installed.\" \n \n Xora Inc., now ClickSoftware Solution, is not a party to the complaint. \n \n According to a September 2011 press release, the app enables employees to create electronic timecards on their phones to track when their shifts start, when they take breaks, and when a shift ends. \n \n Plaintiff attorney Gail Glick told Courthouse News that Arias was one of the first employees asked to put the app on her phone. \n \n \"They were guinea pigs,\" Glick said. \n \n Arias says in her complaint that she researched the app and asked Stubits if Intermex would be tracking her whereabouts when she was off the clock. \n \n \"Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she had installed the app on her phone,\" Arias says in her complaint. \"Plaintiff expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying plaintiff more than NetSpend.\" \n \n Stubits also told Arias she had to keep her phone on \"24/7\" to assist clients, and \"scolded\" her when she uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, the complaint adds. \n \n Arias says Intermex fired her a few weeks later. \n \n Glick said that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a \"legitimate business interest\" to do so. \n \n \"But if an employee can't stop it, then that is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy,\" she said. \n \n Arias objected to the app because there was no way to turn it off when she was at home. Even if she shut down the app on her phone, it would still be running in the background, Glick said. \n \n \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" she added. \"She was not underperforming, so there was no reason to monitor her.\" \n \n To make matters worse, Glick said, Intermex was so angry at her objection to the app that it went \"above and beyond a normal wrongful termination and interfered with her ability to earn a livelihood.\" \n \n Arias says in her complaint that Robert Lisy, Intermex's president and CEO, \"telephoned John Nelson, vice president of NetSpend, and informed Nelson that plaintiff had been disloyal to NetSpend and was employed by Intermex. As a result of Lisy's intentional and malicious interference with plaintiff's contract with NetSpend, NetSpend fired plaintiff promptly. NetSpend specifically cited Lisy's phone call as the reason for the decision to terminate plaintiff,\" the complaint states. \n \n Lisy, Nelson and NetSpend are not parties to the complaint. \n \n With two black marks against her and a gap in her employment record, Arias has had a hard time finding a new job, Glick said. \n \n Representatives for Intermex did not respond to comment requests by press time. \n \n Arias seeks an injunction and general, special and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination and unfair business practices. \n \n Her attorney Gail A. Glick is with Alexander, Krakow & Glick of Santa Monica. \"We intend to pursue this aggressively and get her the justice she deserves,\" Glick said. \"What we have here is a really egregious situation, and we are hoping to right that wrong.\"",

That's according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which looked at more than 5,000 customer-service-related issues in the first half of this year and found that, on average, companies didn't have a great experience for their customers, the Los Angeles Times reports. Some of the top issues: In-person customer service: Customer service is by far the most common type of service a company offers, but it's not always the most pleasant. Nearly half of all complaints were about in-person service, but only one out of every five complaints was about a phone call. In-store service: Customers are more likely to leave a company if they're unhappy with the service, the Times notes. So what can companies do to make their in-store experience more pleasant? Some companies are starting to offer incentives to customers, like gift cards or points for good behavior. Others are simply increasing the amount of time customers spend with a company. \"The more time they spend with your company, the more likely they are to recommend you to their friends and family,\" \u2013 When money transfer company Intermex hired Myrna Arias as a sales executive and account manager last year, it agreed to let her work for another company, NetSpend, until she qualified for Intermex's medical insurance.

    "document": "Story highlights Immigration agency's \"Operation Sunflower\" identified 123 child victims of pornography, abuse \n \n Some victims were as young as 3; others were abused as children and are now adults \n \n Law enforcement officials in six other countries also made arrests in the operation \n \n An international operation led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement aimed at child pornography and sexual abuse has resulted in the arrest of 245 suspects, officials announced Thursday. All but 23 of the suspects were apprehended in the United States. \n \n The agency said that during the course of Operation Sunflower, law enforcement officers identified 123 victims of child exploitation and removed 44 of those children from their alleged abusers with whom they were living. The other cases involved victims who were exploited by people outside their homes or children who were harmed years ago and are now adults. \n \n Several of the children were shockingly young. Five were under age 3. Nine were between the ages of 4 and 6. Of the 123 victims, 110 lived in the United States in 19 different states. ICE officials did not identify the six other countries where victims were identified or where some of the arrests were made, citing the need to work discreetly with international law enforcement partners. \n \n According to ICE, some of those arrested during Operation Sunflower were registered sex offenders. \n \n Operation Sunflower was conducted in November and December, but efforts are continuing on other cases. During a news conference, ICE Director John Morton said the agency was calling on the public to provide tips and mentioned several open investigations. One of those cases involves the sexual molestation of an unidentified girl thought to be around 13. \n \n Investigators believe the abuse took place about 11 years ago, but the pornographic images were widely circulated. ICE has posted pictures of an unidentified woman and man suspected of abusing the girl on its website. The woman has some distinctive tattoos that investigators hope will lead to tips about her identity. \n \n Based on a forensic analysis of the pornographic images in that case, investigators think the abuse occurred in the Los Angeles or San Fernando Valley area of California. Although the girl may now be an adult, ICE officials want to identify and prosecute the suspects and prevent them from harming new victims. \n \n \"Forensic analysis technology has become critical in the fight against child exploitation,\" Morton said. \"We are coming across these images on the Internet. They are being produced in one country but shared literally around the world, often in real time.\" \n \n Morton said ICE works with other law enforcement agencies and with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to look for clues in the pictures of abuse to identify where the acts occurred and track down the victims and perpetrators. \n \n The name Operation Sunflower was chosen to commemorate a case from 2011 in which Danish law enforcement officials shared images and chat board information about a 16-year-old boy who allegedly planned to rape an 11-year-old girl. One image taken from a moving car showed a road sign with a sunflower on it. ICE's Homeland Security Investigations determined that the road sign was unique to Kansas. Agents were then able to find the exact stretch of road where the picture was taken and to locate the girl. ||||| Federal agents identified 123 sexually exploited children -- some as young as 2 -- and arrested 245 suspected child porn producers in a five-week operation that spanned 46 states and six countries and includes the Bay Area, a federal official announced Thursday. \n \n Of the more than 100 abused children identified in Operation Sunflower, 44 were directly rescued from their abusers and 79 were identified as being exploited by others outside their homes or are now adults who were victimized as children. The arrests -- 37 in California, the most of any state -- were mostly executed during the first week of December, but agents are still working on rescuing and identifying victims. \n \n In the Bay Area, agents procured five indictments for individuals from their early 20s to early 50s. The four arrested were from San Jose, San Leandro, San Francisco and Sonoma County, and one remains on the lam. \n \n Fourteen Fresno-area residents were also arrested and three children from that region rescued, including a 7-year-old girl with disabilities. \n \n \"Whenever our investigations reveal the production and distribution of new child pornography online, we will do everything we can to rescue the victim and prosecute the abuser even if takes us years or (going) around the world to do it,\" said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton at a Washington D.C. news conference Thursday. \n \n Advertisement \n \n One of the suspects is Michael Lindsay, 53, of San Jose, arrested Nov. 8 at San Francisco International Airport on suspicion of engaging in child sex tourism. He was boarding a flight to Manila, Philippines. Two months earlier, Lindsay returned from a trip to the Philippines and that country issued a criminal complaint alleging he had sexual contact with a 13-year-old girl. \n \n Agents continue to search for additional victims, as evidence suggests Lindsay had sexual contact with additional children, according to ICE. \n \n Of the 123 victims (70 female, 53 male) identified in the operation, five were under the age of 3; nine were 4 to 6; 21 were 7 to 9; 11 were ages 10 to 12; 38 were 13 to 15; and 15 were ages 16 to 17. Twenty-four victims were found to be adults now. \n \n ICE's Homeland Security Investigations agents dubbed the worldwide investigation \"Operation Sunflower\" to commemorate the anniversary of a successful operation that rescued an 11-year-old Kansas girl from rape. It was the agency's first case in their new Victim Identification Program. \n \n In the 2011 case, Danish police alerted American authorities to a 16-year-old boy soliciting advice on a pedophile chat room and posting images of the 11-year-old girl, saying he planned to rape her. Agents had no idea where the suspect and victim were. \n \n Working with high-tech video equipment, law enforcement was able to extrapolate a sunflower-shaped road sign in a video from a moving car that the suspect posted. The yellow freeway sign was determined to be unique to Kansas. \n \n For days, pairs of ICE agents drove the Kansas freeways before finding the sign on a rural freeway. From there, with the help of local police, they identified a swimming pool featured in another video and then tracked down the victim before any crime was committed. Last fiscal year, 292 victims were identified or rescued from ICE investigations and 1,655 child predators were arrested. \n \n \"We are defending the defenseless,\" Morton said. \n \n Morton asked for the public's help in identifying three men and a woman in three unsolved Operation Sunflower cases. In the first case, investigators believe the photographs were taken about 11 years ago with an adult man and woman sexually molesting a girl who looks to be about 13 years old. Agents believe the images may have been taken in Los Angeles, or possibly the San Fernando Valley area. \n \n The other two cases involve white male adult suspects abusing pre-pubescent toddlers. Their whereabouts are unknown. \n \n Anyone with information or tips that can assist in these investigations can call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or visit www.ICE.gov/tips. Tips may be reported anonymously. \n \n Contact Matthias Gafni at 925-952-5026. Follow him at Twitter.com/mgafni.",

He praised moderators Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper for their \u201cgreat job moving us through under difficult circumstances.\u201d \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cIt got very uncomfortable from up close. But if you can dig through some of the rhetoric and some of the name calling that went on, I think there really were some substantive answers,\u201d he said in an interview on CNN, still wearing his red sweater. \u201cIt's just unfortunate that we have to wade through so much to get to them.\u201d \n \n The mustachioed debate attendee rocketed to Internet fame in the closing moments of Sunday night\u2019s debate, launching a flurry of social media posts about his attire and facial hair. Video showing him photographing the emptying debate hall with what appeared to be a disposable camera only further endeared him to the masses. \n \n Bone joked that his Twitter account had gained hundreds of followers and that he felt he had to reprise his red sweater on the morning after the debate because \u201cit's more famous than me. I just had to bring myself along.\u201d \n \n He also said that he did not know during the debate that Donald Trump had invited an array of women who claimed to have been wronged by the Clintons to sit in the audience on Sunday night, including three who allege that Bill Clinton had either raped or made unwanted sexual advances toward them. The former president has denied all three allegations. \n \n Bone said the move likely would not affect his decision on whom to vote for in November, but he added that inviting the women to attend \u201cwas uncalled for.\u201d \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think that will factor into my decision because I really try to stick to the issues. But if I\u2019m being honest, that was, I feel like that was uncalled for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has very little to do with Hillary Clinton\u2019s ability to be president, her husband\u2019s bad behavior from 20 years ago. And if Mr. Trump wants us to forget his past behaviors, he needs to quit dredging up those of his political opponents.\u201d \n \n Asked whether Sunday night\u2019s debate had given him any clarity on whom he might vote for, Bone said it had done just the opposite. He told CNN that he had been leaning toward voting for Trump but that Clinton\u2019s composure and answers had impressed him. \n \n And asked how he arrived at his now-famous wardrobe choice for the evening, Bone said the sweater was actually a backup plan. \n \n \u201cI had a really nice olive suit that I love a great deal and my mother would have been very proud to see me wearing on television, but apparently I have gained about 30 pounds and when I went to get in my car the morning of the debate I split the seat of my pants all the way open,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the red sweater is plan B.

(Robin Zielinski/Las Cruces Sun-News via AP) \n \n Three miles and only 20 minutes apart, dual explosions rocked two churches in Las Cruces, N.M., Sunday morning, injuring none but leaving both congregations shaken. \n \n The incidents are being investigated separately, Las Cruces Police Department spokesman Dan Trujillo said, but with an awareness of the \u201ctotality of the day\u2019s events.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely for us to have two incidents like this on the same day 20 minutes apart and have them not be connected,\u201d he told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \n \n The first explosion, set off by a device planted in a mailbox, went off around 8:20 a.m. just as congregants at Calvary Baptist Church in southern Las Cruces were beginning to gather for the morning\u2019s services. Twenty minutes later a second device exploded inside a trash can outside the Holy Cross Catholic Church just a short drive away, shattering the building\u2019s glass front and startling worshipers in the midst of their morning Mass. \n \n \u201cI was right in the middle of saying the words \u2018take and eat, this is my body\u2019 and there was a \u2018Pow!\u2019 I mean, I knew it had to be more than a gunshot,\u201d Monsignor John Anderson told the Las Cruces Sun-News. \u201cIt didn\u2019t know if it was a shotgun blast, I didn\u2019t know what. But it was very loud and I just kept on saying the words.\u201d \n \n Trujillo described the explosive devices as \u201cdangerous, much more dangerous than just fireworks or firecrackers,\u201d and intended to cause harm. But investigators do not yet have more details about what caused the explosions. Nor are they sure why these two churches in particular were targeted \u2014 Trujillo noted that Calvary Baptist is on the same street as at least five other churches, none of which were bombed. \n \n New Mexico State Police; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security are investigating the incidents alongside several local law enforcement agencies. As of late Sunday night they had no information about potential suspects. \n \n New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R) headed to her hometown, a city of about 100,000 just an hour\u2019s drive north of the Mexican border, for a news conference with law enforcement Sunday night. \n \n \u201cOnly a coward would place an explosive device in a place of peace and a place of worship,\u201d she told reporters. \u201c\u2026 If your intention was to bring fear to those who worship, you have failed. Our faith is too strong and our fellowship is unbreakable.\u201d \n \n Asked if the bombings were an act of terrorism, State Police Chief Pete Kassetas responded that he could only say for sure that the explosions certainly provoked terror. \n \n \u201cBut if you\u2019re asking me to put it in a nice, little, neat box to say that I can link this \u2026 to any one group or individual, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. \n \n Later, in response to a different question, he added, \u201cSomeone put some time and effort into this, we believe.\u201d \n \n The first explosion, at Calvary Baptist, went off outside an administrative entrance on the opposite side of the church from the door where worshipers were streaming in. About 30 people were already inside the building when they heard a loud noise and felt the building shake. \n \n Church member Dennis Llewellyn, who said he was a former special forces member with the Marines, recognized bomb parts among the debris. \n \n \u201cIt was a real bomb, I saw all the parts,\u201d he told the Sun-News. \n \n Services were already underway when the second device went off at Holy Cross Catholic Church 20 minutes later, the sound of splintering glass interrupting communion. The pastor finished the Lord\u2019s Prayer, then sent a deacon to investigate the noise. Minutes later police arrived. \n \n \u201cWe have it under control but we need you to leave the building,\u201d they instructed the congregation, college student and lifelong Holy Cross parishioner Ann-Marie Sullivan told the Sun-News. \n \n None of the roughly 200 people inside the building were injured, though the church\u2019s glass front was destroyed. The congregation was saved by the fact that the explosion happened during the communion; normally someone is posted at the building\u2019s entrance, Anderson told the Sun-News, but everyone had come inside for that part of the service. If the bomb had gone off just 10 minutes later, the church members would have been gathering in the building\u2019s entrance and it\u2019s likely several would have been hurt. \n \n He added that the church needs to increase its security, adding patrols to its parking lot and cameras to its front entrance in the wake of the incident. \n \n \u201cSomebody wanted attention, and somebody wanted to be very destructive against the Catholics, I guess,\u201d he told the Sun-News. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to read that.\u201d",

(Associated Press) \n \n INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 An Indiana man facing weapons and ammunitions charges in California after telling officers he was headed to a gay pride event was charged Wednesday in Indiana with child molestation \u2014 allegations that apparently spurred his cross-country journey to Los Angeles, a prosecutor said. \n \n James Wesley Howell, 20, faces one count of child molesting in southern Indiana's Clark County. If convicted, the Jeffersonville, Indiana, man could face up to 16 years in prison. \n \n Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull told The Associated Press that Howell took a 12-year-old girl to a state forestry property May 31 and had sex with her. Mull said Howell met the girl through an adult friend. \n \n The girl's mother reported the allegations to police June 2 after learning about them. \n \n A message seeking comment was left Wednesday for Howell family lawyer Bobby Boyd of Louisville, Kentucky. Telephone calls to Pamela Jones, Howell's public defender in the California weapons case, rang unanswered. \n \n Mull said Howell was interviewed on June 7 by a police detective in the molestation case and apparently left Indiana at some point after speaking to the officer. \n \n He said it's a \"logical conclusion to draw\" that Howell traveled to California to flee the child molestation investigation. But he said he doesn't know what Howell's intentions were in California. \n \n \"He did flee and go to California, where he was apprehended on June 12. So there was a very short window of time between the time he became aware he was under investigation here and when he ended up in California,\" Mull said. \n \n He said he intends to have Howell extradited to Indiana to face the molestation charge. \n \n California authorities charged Howell on Tuesday with three felony weapons and ammunition charges after he was found in Santa Monica with a loaded assault rifle with magazines rigged to allow 60 shots to be fired in quick succession, plus 15 pounds of chemicals mixed and ready to explode. \n \n Howell has pleaded not guilty to those charges. A Los Angeles County judge set Howell's bail at $2 million. \n \n He was arrested in Santa Monica early Sunday, hours after an attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida left 49 people dead. \n \n Howell told police he was headed to a gay pride event in West Hollywood that attracts hundreds of thousands of people. It's unclear whether he intended any violence at the LA Pride event, but his arrest put police and event organizers on heightened alert. \n \n Friends in Indiana described Howell as a gun enthusiast with a short temper. In October, he twice was accused of pulling a gun and making threats, once against a boyfriend and once against a neighbor. \n \n Howell was convicted in April of misdemeanor intimidation for the incident with his neighbor. Under the terms of his probation, he was not allowed to have weapons or leave Indiana. \n \n Court documents in the Indiana molestation case state that the 12-year-old girl had \"developed a crush on (Howell) and wanted to go to a car event with him.\" Howell, the girl's brother and the brother's girlfriend were all members of the same \"car club\" and periodically attended meetings where people show off their cars, documents say. \n \n The girl's mother gave Howell permission to attend the car event and afterward, Howell offered to take the girl to the home of a family friend she considered her grandmother, court documents say. \n \n According to the affidavit, he first took the girl to the state forestry property before taking her to the family friend's house. \n \n Federal agents searched Howell's Jeffersonville home on Monday but declined to release any details. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

A Clark County prosecutor\u2014who plans to have Howell extradited back to Indiana\u2014tells the AP that Howell and the girl's brother are members of the same car club and that the girl attended a car event with Howell. Afterward, Howell offered to drive the girl to the home of a family friend but first stopped at a forested area, where Howell molested her, the prosecutor says. The girl's mom went to police two days later and Howell was interviewed on June 7. Police say he admitted to fleeing Indiana \"due to his concerns over existing or pending criminal charges\" after he was found early Sunday with a loaded assault rifle, Taser, hood, magazines, handcuffs, and 15 pounds of explosive chemicals that \"posed a grave danger to both persons and property,\" per the Los Angeles Times. He faces up to 16 years if convicted of child molestation, and more than nine years if convicted of felony weapons charges, including possession of explosives on a highway, possession of an assault weapon, and possession of high-capacity magazines.

It is finished\" \n \n Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams has criticised the timing of his arrest over the IRA murder of Jean McConville. \n \n Speaking after his release following four days of questioning, Mr Adams said there was a \"sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign\" alleging his involvement in the 1972 killing. \n \n A file will be sent to the Public Prosecution Service, police said as he was released. \n \n Mrs McConville's son said the family's fight for justice would continue. \n \n Jean McConville, a 37-year-old widow, was abducted from her Belfast home, shot and secretly buried. \n \n Her body was found on a beach in County Louth in 2003. \n \n \"The McConville family is going to stay to the bitter end until we get justice,\" Michael McConville said. \n \n \"These have been quite difficult days for the McConville family and they have been very stressful. We would like the people to know that the family is going to stay to the bitter end until we get justice for our mother. \n \n \"We know it is going to be a long road, but we have already been fighting for justice for 40 odd years and we are not going to stop now.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Michael McConville: \"These have been difficult days for the McConville family\" \n \n Speaking at a press conference in Belfast following his release on Sunday evening, Mr Adams said he had contacted Northern Ireland police two months ago about the McConville case. \n \n He said he had gone voluntarily to police last week and then been arrested. He questioned their timing in the middle of an election campaign and claimed they could have used discretion rather than arresting him. They did not need to use \"pernicious, coercive legislation to deal with a legacy issue\", he said. \n \n The Sinn F\u00e9in leader said police had conducted 33 taped interviews and detectives had presented him with old photographs of himself and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and with interviews conducted by people who were \"enemies of the peace process\". \n \n He added he did not go to Antrim police station \"expecting special treatment\", but said his arrest had sent out the \"wrong signal\". \n \n Mr Adams, a former MP for West Belfast and now an elected representative for County Louth in the Irish parliament, presented himself for interview by prior arrangement with detectives on Wednesday night. He was then arrested under the terrorism act for questioning about the IRA murder of mother of 10 Mrs McConville. \n \n At Sunday's press conference, he again said he was innocent of any involvement in her murder. \n \n He said Sinn F\u00e9in remained fully committed to the political process in Northern Ireland. \"The IRA is gone, it's finished,\" he added. \n \n \"I want to make it clear that I support the PSNI.\" \n \n Prime Minister David Cameron discussed Mr Adams' release on Sunday night during a phone call with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny. \n \n Image caption Police officers and vans emerged from Antrim PSNI station but it was thought to be a decoy, as Mr Adams was taken out by another route \n \n On Sunday, as loyalists blocked the front of the police station, Mr Adams was taken out by a different exit. \n \n Later on Sunday night there were reports of disorder in the loyalist Sandy Row area of south Belfast. \n \n Other political parties have rejected claims that the timing of the arrest was political. \n \n Democratic Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson said: \"There is nothing within the law of Northern Ireland or the UK that says that during an election campaign the police have to suspend the investigation of murder. \n \n \"That would be absurd and would be political policing.\" \n \n Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said: \"Our thoughts are with the McConville family tonight. Their 42 years wait for truth and justice makes Gerry Adams's complaint over the 'two month' delay between him offering to speak to the PSNI and their response seem churlish to say the least. \n \n \"Let us remember it was Gerry Adams who initiated this sequence of events.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gerry Adams left in a convoy that exited the rear of Antrim police station, as Jon Brain reports \n \n Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Alasdair McDonnell said: \"I see the fact that Gerry Adams presented himself voluntarily to a police station. As the timing was his, I find it hard to justify when there would be an appropriate time to arrest a political leader.\" \n \n Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford of Alliance said he saw politicians from a variety of backgrounds seeking to interfere in policing. \n \n \"I think politicians would be extremely well advised to steer out of allegations of political policing,\" he said. \n \n The Traditional Unionist Voice party said: \"The release of Adams without charge raises serious questions as to how far the authorities blinked in the face of Sinn Fein threats and tantrums.\" \n \n Lawyers to decide \n \n The decision to release Mr Adams means that prosecution lawyers will decide if charges will be brought. \n \n The file sent by the police to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) will detail the evidence gathered. \n \n It will be up to PPS lawyers to decide if there is enough evidence to bring any charges and what those charges would be. \n \n Image caption Police officers in riot gear waited outside the station \n \n The test for prosecution is met if there is sufficient evidence that can be admitted in court to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction. Lawyers must also decide if the prosecution is required in the public interest. \n \n It could take some time for police to prepare the file for the PPS, with prosecutors then taking a further period to assess whatever evidence is presented. \n \n Northern Ireland's director of public prosecutions, Barra McGrory QC, is a former solicitor for Mr Adams and so will delegate a decision on the file to his deputy. \n \n Mrs McConville is one of Northern Ireland's Disappeared, those who were abducted, murdered and buried in secret by republicans during the Troubles. \n \n She was kidnapped from her home in Divis Flats in west Belfast in front of her children after being wrongly accused of being an informer to the British Army. \n \n Boston College tapes \n \n Last month, Ivor Bell, 77, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder, and there have also been a number of other arrests recently. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Jean McConville, a widowed mother of 10, was abducted and murdered by the IRA in December 1972 \n \n The case against Mr Bell is based on an interview he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the US. \n \n The Boston College tapes are a series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalist and republican paramilitaries, designed to be an oral history of the Troubles.",

Adams has long been suspected in the killing, but this is the first time they've made an arrest of a senior Sinn Fein official. The IRA claimed the killing was a protest against British rule in Northern Ireland, but the truth is much more complicated, explains the New York Times. The group was led by Seamus Hughes, a top commander known as the \"Mad Max\" of the IRA. He died in 1997, but the body of McConVILLE, said to have been shot in the back of the head, wasn't found until 1999, reports the AP.

    "document": "Jeb Bush, who entered Tuesday night\u2019s GOP debate with the most on the line, rose to the occasion and turned in his strongest debate performance to date, but it was Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz who again outshined their rivals. \n \n While Bush's ability to find his footing on the primetime stage should reassure nervous donors, it\u2019s unlikely to fundamentally change his position in the broader field\u2014a B grade, after all, only brings an F up to a D. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Rubio and Cruz, now viewed as the two strongest candidates, ceded no ground, exploiting a much softer debate format in Milwaukee and again showcasing their mastery of the facts and ease under the bright lights. \n \n Donald Trump also roared back to his caustic, combative form. But Ben Carson turned in his shakiest performance yet, struggling with a debate that focused more on substantive policy questions and taking up the least amount of speaking time despite his position in the center of the stage. \n \n The two-hour debate, marked by a smattering of sharp exchanges but fewer fireworks than the three previous showdowns, is unlikely to dramatically alter the race as it now stands\u2014and the status quo may hold through the end of the year, with the next GOP debate 35 days away and the month of December effectively a dead zone for campaign fundraising. \n \n Many of the spats that generated heat on stage Tuesday night were familiar ones\u2014illustrative of the broader ideological divisions within the GOP. \n \n The first focused on immigration, with Trump and Cruz on one side opposite John Kasich and Bush, both desperate for air time given their standing behind the current front-runners and eagerly blasting Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. \n \n \"It\u2019s a silly argument. It\u2019s not an adult argument. We all know you can\u2019t pick them up and ship them back across the border,\u201d said Kasich, paving a path for Bush to follow. \n \n Trump responded by taking a dig at the Ohio governor and his state's economic recovery. \"You\u2019re lucky in Ohio that you struck oil,\" he said. \n \n As the tussle escalated and Kasich started talking over him, Trump interjected, saying \"I don't have to hear from this man.\" As Kasich looked to cut in again, Trump suggested he \"let Jeb speak.\" \n \n Bush followed by mockingly thanking Trump for \"allowing me to speak at the debate.\" He also chided Trump for the mass deportation proposal, calling it \"impossible.\" \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not embracing American values, and it would tear communities apart,\u201d Bush said about Trump\u2019s plan. \u201cAnd even having this conversation sends a powerful signal. They\u2019re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign when they hear this \u2026 the way you win the presidency is you have practical plans.\u201d \n \n Cruz followed with a defense of Trump\u2019s position, asserting \u201cit\u2019s not anti-immigrant,\u201d and landing a repeat of his well-received attack on the media. \n \n \u201cI understand when the mainstream media covers immigration, it often doesn\u2019t see it as an economic issue, but I can tell you for millions of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI would say the politics of it would be very, very, different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande \u2014 or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press.\u201d \n \n Rubio, the author of the failed comprehensive immigration reform package that passed the Senate in 2013 but failed in the House for lack of support from grassroots conservatives, stayed out of the fray. \n \n Rubio did land his own memorable moment when he tangled with Rand Paul, who criticized his proposals to increase military spending. \n \n \u201cI know that Rand is a committed isolationist,\u201d Rubio said, dismissively. \u201cI know that the world is a safer and a better place when the United States is the strongest country in the world.\u201d \n \n \"Marco, Marco, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure to the federal government?\u201d Paul shot back. \u201cYou cannot be a conservative if you\u2019re going to keep promoting new programs that you\u2019re not going to pay for. I want a strong national defense, but I don\u2019t want us to be bankrupt.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou think defending this nation is expensive,\" Cruz chimed in. \"Try not defending it.\" \n \n Bush, desperate to improve on his disastrous performance in last month\u2019s third GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., steadied himself with his response on immigration after showing some edginess early on. \n \n Bush entered Tuesday night\u2019s fourth GOP debate vowing to stop following the moderators\u2019 rules and dead set on making his voice heard. \n \n But in a major shift from the first three debates that quickly devolved into freewheeling slugfests, the five candidates who got questions before Bush did at the outset of the two-hour debate in Milwaukee were suddenly playing by the rules. \n \n When Kasich, despite ranking behind Bush in the national polling, offered a lengthy answer to his first question and then threatened to interject after Cruz\u2019s opening statement, an antsy Bush jumped in. \n \n \"I got about four minutes last debate, I'm gonna get my question,\u201d Bush said. \n \n \u201cI appreciate it, Jeb,\u201d Kasich shot back. \u201cI\u2019m all for you.\u201d \n \n Bush got his footing as the debate progressed, attacking Trump for his assertion that the U.S. cannot be the world's policemen. \"Donald is wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this,\" Bush said. \"We are not going to be the world\u2019s policemen but we sure as hell better be the world\u2019s leader.\" \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s like a board game. That\u2019s like playing Monopoly or something,\" said Bush, who seemingly meant to refer to the game Risk, not Monopoly. \n \n Twelve days after his rehearsed attack on Rubio backfired so spectacularly, Bush opted not to attack or engage Rubio at all. \n \n Carson, who now sits atop some national polls, struggled on a foreign policy question about how he would combat ISIS in the Middle East. \n \n \u201cWe have to say, how do we make them look like losers? And I think the way to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate,\u201d Carson said, seemingly arguing for ground forces to remove ISIS from Iraq. \n \n \u201cTake that from them, take that land from them, we could do that fairly easily,\u201d he said. \n \n Carson also addressed the recent scrutiny of a number of his anecdotal biographical claims, again criticizing the media for portraying him unfairly. \n \n \u201cThe fact of the matter is, we should vet all candidates,\u201d Carson said early in the debate. \u201cWhat I do have a problem with is being lied about and putting that out there as truth. I don\u2019t even mind that so much if they do that with everybody \u2026 when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no this was a terrorist attack and tells everybody else it was a video, where I come from, they call that a lie. \n \n \u201cI think that\u2019s very different from somebody misinterpreting when I said I was offered a scholarship to West Point,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople who know me know that I\u2019m a honest person.\u201d \n \n ||||| GOP presidential candidates clashed over immigration, government spending and how to handle Russia's Vladimir Putin during Tuesday night's debate. As the night got heated, the audience got involved: here are the must-watch moments. (Ashleigh Joplin and Rebecca Schatz/Fox Business Network) \n \n The eight top Republican presidential candidates gathered for the fourth debate of the 2016 campaign Tuesday night in Milwaukee. It was a more understated affair than the last GOP debate sponsored by CNBC but still managed to yield some bests and worsts. \n \n Here are my winners and losers from the night that was: \n \n Winners \n \n * Marco Rubio: Rubio's line about welders making more money than philosophy majors will be quoted all over the place in the post-debate analysis. (And, no, it wasn't totally accurate.) Rubio knocked it out of the park when debating military spending and the right role for America in the world with Rand Paul. He got a meatball of a question when asked by the moderators about Hillary Clinton's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as compared with his own; he, unsurprisingly, answered it well and easily. Time and time again, he oozed knowledge while appearing entirely relaxed. One nit to pick with Rubio: He can \u2014 and did at times Tuesday night \u2014 come across as slightly too rehearsed, the student reciting things back to the teacher from memory but without actually understanding what any of it means. \n \n * Ted Cruz: For the second straight debate, the senator from Texas shone under the bright lights. His line about the tax code having more words than the Bible was a good and memorable one. His repeated denunciations of Washington's \"crony\" culture will leave a lot of Republican heads nodding in agreement. Cruz proved Tuesday night that of the \"outsider\" candidates, he is the one best equipped to carry their message going forward. \n \n * Ben Carson: In the first three debates, I watched in wonder as Carson's numbers kept moving up after what I perceived to be nearly nonexistent performances. But Carson \u2014 from his first answer on Tuesday night \u2014 was more energetic (that's a pretty low bar given Carson's past performances) and more dialed in than I had seen him. He was helped by a moderator question on his past exaggerations/inaccuracies regarding his life story that would give the term \"softball\" a bad name. And by the fact that none of his rivals seemed interested in taking the fight to him on the issue of the inconsistencies of his recounting of the past. Carson was, as usual, very shaky on foreign policy and wasn't much better on regulatory reform. But he did more than enough to keep himself at or near the top of the GOP field. \n \n * Carly Fiorina: Like Cruz and Rubio, Fiorina proved something Tuesday night that we already knew: She's an able debater. She inserted herself into a variety of discussions \u2014 foreign policy, taxes \u2014 where she left a positive mark. It also helped that the audience in the room in Milwaukee seemed very much on her side. I still think Fiorina, like Rubio, can come across as too rote at times. \n \n * Rand Paul: The senator from Kentucky (finally) found ways to get his voice heard in a debate. The problem for him is that he's almost certainly too far down in polling \u2014 and in the money chase \u2014 for it to matter much. Still, Paul found a platform to voice his unique views on foreign and fiscal policy, and, at this stage of his candidacy, that amounts to a win. \n \n Losers \n \n * Donald Trump: Trump, as he has in each of the first four debates, stood center stage in Milwaukee on Tuesday night. But for the two-plus hours that the debate ran, Trump felt ancillary to the conversation. When he did get time to speak, he simply repeated his now-familiar lines \u2014 we don't win anymore, I have a great company, etc. \u2014 and little else. His answers on foreign policy were not good. His random attack on Fiorina \u2014 \"why does she keep interrupting everybody?\" \u2014 earned him boos from the crowd (and helped her). Trump just didn't seem all that interested in being there. It likely won't affect his poll numbers, since nothing seems to. But that doesn't change the fact he was off his game. \n \n * John Kasich: The Ohio governor came out with a strategy to install himself right in the center of the debate. To do that, he interrupted, cajoled and pouted his way through it. His positions on immigration and on Wall Street banks won't win him any support from the GOP base (he got booed for his Wall Street answer). But it wasn't really about policy. Kasich seemed peevish, short-tempered and anything but presidential. \n \n * Jeb Bush: Look, the former Florida governor wasn't bad in this debate. In fact, he was far better than the lifeless showing he put in last month. But he wasn't good enough. Jeb's first answer \u2014 pledging to repeal all of Obama's executive orders \u2014 was forceful and quite good. But as the debate wore on, Bush repeatedly missed chances to jump into conversations \u2014 a long back-and-forth involving multiple candidates over taxes jumps to mind \u2014 and when he did speak he was somewhat halting and awkward. The Bush people readily acknowledge that debating is not his strong suit. And I readily acknowledge that being a good debater doesn't guarantee victory. But Bush just isn't comfortable on the debate stage \u2014 and it shows. \n \n * Anecdotes: Virtually every candidate took a question about broad fiscal policy and turned it into a heartwarming/heart-wrenching tale of \"Jim and Aileen Jones from random city in random state.\" I know candidates and their staffs believe these anecdotes bolster the idea that they are out meeting regular people and not sitting in the halls of Washington \u2014 wherever those are \u2014 opining on stuff. But the anecdotes come across more often than not as trite and cliched rather than revealing and powerful. Let's just stop doing it! Okay? Good. It's a deal. \n \n * Debate format: The Fox Business moderators went out of their way to make clear that they, unlike the unmentioned but ever-present CNBC moderators, would be sticking to substantive economic issues in the debate. Then they went out of their way to praise themselves for doing so. Fine. But the debate was largely lifeless throughout, and the lack of candidate exchanges \u2014 whether because of the rules of the debate or a simple unwillingness to engage \u2014 meant that many of the answers offered were straight from oft-repeated talking points. I don't think that serves the voters' interests \u2014 at all. ||||| Milwaukee \u2014 It was, at last, a debate about policy. If the emergence of Donald Trump and the efforts of previous debate moderators to pit candidates against each other have forestalled the policy arguments that typically characterize Republican primary contests, Fox Business Network\u2019s debate on Tuesday brought them to the fore. \n \n Less than three months before voters go to the polls in January, the candidates clashed on some of the major issues that have divided the Republican party over the past six years: The night\u2019s big moments did not come from one candidate trashing another, but from policy exchanges, first on immigration and then on defense spending. After months of headlines dominated by a real-estate mogul-cum-reality-television star, it was a welcome change of pace. \n \n The event was steady and studious, and the upshot was predictable \u2014 an evening that did little to alter the trajectories of individual candidates or the broader narrative of the race. In the course of two hours there were no knockout punches, no major gaffes, no made-for-opposition-research moments. Each of the candidates went silent for a stretch, but none completely disappeared as in previous debates \u2014 perhaps because the stage had shrunk to only eight, the smallest primetime grouping to date. \n \n If a single issue can be said to have encapsulated the bitter divisions within the Republican party over the past six years, it is immigration, and the key disagreements between the candidates \u2014 over border security, legal immigration, and amnesty \u2014 came to the fore during Tuesday\u2019s debate. \n \n RELATED: Ted Cruz Wins the Night \n \n It was Donald Trump, predictably, who started it all. Heaping praise on court rulings that struck down President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, he reiterated his intention to build a wall on the Southern border. \u201cWe will have a wall, the wall will be built, the wall will be successful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think walls work, just ask Israel.\u201d \n \n John Kasich, the prickly Ohio governor standing three podiums away, denounced Trump\u2019s plan as \u201ca silly argument\u201d that \u201cmakes no sense,\u201d earning notably louder applause than Trump had. \n \n RELATED: Winners & Losers \n \n Enter Jeb Bush, who rebuked his fellow Republicans for having a conversation about deporting illegal immigrants in the first place. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, he said, was trading \u201chigh-fives\u201d over the terrible optics. \n \n The event was steady and studious, and the upshot was predictable \u2014 an evening that did little to alter the trajectories of individual candidates. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with this,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe have to win the presidency. And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans.\u201d He advocated allowing illegal immigrants to earn legal status after paying fines. \u201cThat\u2019s the proper path to making this work,\u201d he said. \n \n The crowd again erupted in applause, seemingly handing the exchange to Bush and Kasich rather than to Trump. Bush was desperately in need of a standout performance after being bulldozed by Marco Rubio at last month\u2019s Colorado debate, and this was perhaps the high point of his evening. As the debate wore on, he seemed to once again disappear for long stretches. \n \n Ted Cruz, ignoring the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm for Bush\u2019s and Kasich\u2019s more moderate immigration stances, then chimed in with the last word on the issue. \u201cIf Republicans join Democrats in granting amnesty, we will lose,\u201d he said bluntly. He went on to argue that Republicans could embrace both legal immigration and the rule of law. It wasn\u2019t a hit with the audience in the debate hall, but will play well with Cruz\u2019s grassroots base. \n \n Marco Rubio, whose introduction met with louder applause than any of his rivals\u2019, once again played a starring role Tuesday night. Two weeks after slapping down Bush in a memorable exchange, the Florida senator was involved in another explosive back-and-forth with Rand Paul, the field\u2019s most vocal champion of so-called \u201cnon-interventionism.\u201d Rubio is perhaps its most visible proponent of a more muscular foreign policy. \n \n Paul charged that Rubio\u2019s call to increase defense spending is \u201cnot very conservative.\u201d \n \n Among Republican primary voters, Rubio knew he was on strong footing, and he pushed back. \u201cI know that Rand is a committed isolationist,\u201d he said, using a term that the Kentucky senator has openly bristled at. Indeed, when Paul laid out his foreign-policy platform a year ago, he declared explicitly that he was \u201cnot an isolationist.\u201d \n \n Paul was unfazed. \u201cMarco, Marco, Marco,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?\u201d \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t even have an economy if we\u2019re not safe,\u201d Rubio replied. \u201cThere are radical jihadists in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon. The Chinese taking over the South China Sea. Yes, I believe the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world.\u201d \n \n It was the biggest applause line of the night, but Paul would not be deterred. \u201cMarco, I don\u2019t think we are any safer from bankruptcy court. As we go further and further into debt, we are less and less safe. This is the most important thing we\u2019re gonna talk about tonight. Can you be a conservative and be for unlimited military spending?\u201d \n \n Cruz jumped in to position himself between his two colleagues, calling for a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d in the debate \u2014 as he has in the Senate, where he\u2019s said his views fall somewhere between those of Rand Paul and John McCain. But he was clearly closer to McCain\u2019s end of the spectrum on Tuesday \u2014 or in this case, to Rubio\u2019s. \u201cYou think defending this nation is expensive? Try not defending it. That\u2019s a lot more expensive,\u201d Cruz said, winning thunderous applause. \n \n The debate over defense spending and America\u2019s role in the world has roiled the GOP in the years since Barack Obama was elected in 2008 partly on the basis of his promises to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Paul\u2019s election in 2010 gave non-interventionism a spokesman on the Republican side, and he rose to national prominence in large part by articulating his view that the United States should play a more restrained role in world affairs. Rubio was elected in 2010 too, and he has served as the leading spokesman of the opposing view, that strengthening and maintaining America\u2019s role as a beacon of freedom abroad is essential to security at home. \n \n On Tuesday, millions of Republican primary voters had the chance to see that debate and others play out in real time, and to make up their own minds. The reality that the night seemed not to move the needle in any significant direction was apparent from the tone and body language of campaign officials. No one had anything but praise for the moderators. Everyone took to the spin room looking pleased and relaxed if not especially triumphant or dejected, all of them satisfied with their candidate\u2019s performance but none claiming a game-changing moment. Milwaukee produced no consensus loser in the eyes of the campaigns and media, no brewing speculation of anyone dropping out in the days ahead \u2014 just talk of soldiering on and bracing for a long, incremental slog to a nominating season that begins Feb. 1 in Iowa. \n \n \u2014 Eliana Johnson is Washington editor of National Review.

He seemed, at times, more commanding. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Of course, it was not a total success \u2014 and Mr. Bush, the 62-year-old scion of an American political dynasty, did not entirely rid himself of awkward behaviors. \n \n There were clenched smiles, obscure geographical references and hands that reflexively darted into his pockets. And after aggressively demanding that Mr. Kasich yield, Mr. Bush suffered a temporary setback: The Ohio governor talked over him anyway, at least temporarily. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But in contrast to previous debates, Mr. Bush generated a handful of memorable lines and moments, and seemed less daunted by Mr. Trump, the resident bully in each of the party\u2019s confrontations so far. \n \n At one point, Mr. Bush tartly thanked Mr. Trump for allowing him a chance to participate in a verbal rumpus. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cThank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really nice of you.

Mr. Bush reluctantly hired a debate coach last month, turning to a trusted family image maker, Jon Kraushar, who had polished the speaking skills of Mr. Bush\u2019s father, President George H.W. Bush, who suffered from his own lapses in syntax. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n During sessions held in Miami and Milwaukee, Mr. Kraushar and Mr. Bush\u2019s aides counseled him to talk about real people and aim his fire at Mrs. Clinton, after an attempt to joust with Mr. Rubio badly backfired. And Mr. Bush vowed to embrace a philosophy long practiced by his more agile peers: Answer the question you want, not the one you were asked. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Moments after the debate, Mr. Bush\u2019s top aides seemed palpably relieved that they would not, at least for a night, have to make excuses for him again. \n \n In a midnight conference call with donors, Sally Bradshaw, a longtime Bush adviser, summed up the sentiment. \n \n \u201cGosh, what a difference a week makes,\u201d she said. ||||| Jeb Bush, left, speaks as Marco Rubio listens during Republican presidential debate at Milwaukee Theatre. | AP Photo Jeb Bush stops the bleeding His supporters say they were reassured by his performance. \n \n MILWAUKEE \u2014 Jeb Bush didn\u2019t try to beat Marco Rubio. He set a lower bar: shooting to best his own panned debate performances. And he succeeded on Tuesday, as top supporters declared a solid, mistake-free night in Milwaukee enough to wrap a \u201ctourniquet\u201d on a campaign that had been bleeding since the last debate two weeks ago. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s always nervous Nellies in every campaign,\u201d said former Sen. Mel Martinez, a Bush supporter spinning for the campaign in Milwaukee. \u201cIf they needed it, tonight certainly should have reassured them.\u201d \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cThank God. He stopped the bleeding tonight,\u201d added Ana Navarro, a Bush friend and adviser. \u201cThis can be the start of a turnaround if he builds on this solid performance.\u201d \n \n While Bush avoided any reprises of his failed confrontation with Rubio, he did come out the gate fiery. His first words were trying to get in his first words. \u201cI got about four minutes in the last debate,\u201d he interrupted early on. \u201cI'm going to get my question \u2014 right now.\u201d \n \n After the previous debate, Bush\u2019s donors urged him to back away from going on offense against Rubio. Some, most notably prominent Florida bundler Brian Ballard, have gone so far as to switch sides to back Rubio in recent days. The discussion of how to take on the candidate whom Bush\u2019s orbit still believes is the biggest threat to his nomination took on added urgency after a report that Bush\u2019s super PAC is considering a $20 million anti-Rubio campaign. \n \n \u201cThere are donors in Florida who want to see peace in the valley, and rightfully so,\u201d said Al Cardenas, a Florida Republican and Bush backer who is also close with Rubio, \u201cand at the same time you\u2019re in the midst of a competitive campaign.\u201d \n \n There were no interactions between the two men on Tuesday night \u2014 an indication, Rubio\u2019s advisers argued, that Bush had learned that a battle with the senator was one it couldn\u2019t win. \n \n \u201cThe phrase where I come from is \u2018There\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule,\u2019\u201d Terry Sullivan, Rubio\u2019s campaign manager, said after the debate. \u201cI kind of feel like folks figured out that taking on Marco isn\u2019t such a great idea. \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone is itching to take on Marco on the debate stage.\u201d \n \n Bush instead took aim at Hillary Clinton and presented himself as a viable general-election candidate. At one point, he scolded his fellow Republicans when talk turned to deportations. \u201cEven having this conversation sends a powerful signal \u2014 they're doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this,\u201d Bush said. \n \n From Day One of his campaign, Bush has suffered from high expectations \u2014 that he would dominate the pursuit of donors, that he would blow away the field, that he would push away others in the field. Few have panned out. \n \n In the two weeks after his disastrous Boulder performance, Bush worked to lower expectations heading into Milwaukee. At numerous campaign stops, in media interviews and on donor calls, Bush went out of his way to say that he\u2019s not a great debater and that he recognizes he needs to improve. It was an intentional effort, aides said, to lower expectations. \n \n Bush\u2019s top aides even got in on the action. On a conference call with New York donors last week, campaign manager Danny Diaz said that Bush had been working with a new debate coach, longtime Republican image guru Jon Kraushar, and that his supporters should expect an improved performance. It was a subtle play to calm nerves, while simultaneously diminishing anticipation that the former Florida governor \u2014 never stellar on the debate stage \u2014 was headed for a breakout performance. \n \n Those close to Bush say he spent time after the Boulder debacle working on optics \u2014 including his posture. In the first three debates, Bush \u2014 who hadn't waged a campaign since 2002 and showed signs of rust \u2014 tended to slouch. And he brought on Kraushar, a longtime adviser to Fox News honcho Roger Ailes, who specializes in helping his clients forge a connection with TV viewers. \n \n Bush certainly looked more confident as he challenged Trump on his foreign policy. \u201cDonald's wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this. We're not going to be the world's policeman, but we sure as heck better be the world's leader.\u201d \n \n Awkward Bush, however, didn\u2019t disappear entirely. \u201cI was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is. It was \u2014 get the \u2014 kind of the,\u201d he said, gesturing in hopes that the audience would laugh at his double-Washington wordplay. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he relented as they didn\u2019t. \n \n For all the talk of a Bush campaign crashing out early, he\u2019s planning for the long road ahead \u2014 and doing the donor maintenance involved. This week, his top advisers sent out invitations to top donors for a December campaign update in Miami. \n \n \u201cJeb will show you the Miami he loves and tell you, in his own words, \u2018how we are going to win this damn thing!\u2019\u201d read the invitation to donors from Bush finance chief Heather Larrison. \n \n Following the debate, Bush has a breakneck pace. He'll be heading to Iowa for three events on Wednesday, going to Michigan for a quick fundraiser on Thursday and continuing on for two days of events in New Hampshire before flying to Florida for a big cattle call in his home state. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know that you fix all the problems with one debate,\u201d said Martinez. \u201cThis is an ongoing deal. This is going to be a long race. He\u2019s in it for the long haul. He\u2019s weathered some difficult days. That showed you something about his character, about who he is and what he\u2019s made of.\u201d \n \n Rubio\u2019s team was less circumspect. \u201cWe won. Again,\u201d Sullivan declared. \u201c4-0.\u201d ||||| The fourth Republican presidential debate on Tuesday night was a less dramatic, more substantive affair than the previous three clashes of the 2016 cycle.

Some of his best moments Tuesday night were on very different topics, including college education and foreign policy. \n \n In the debate\u2019s closing stages, he displayed a light touch when moderator Maria Bartiromo delivered a lengthy and positive summary of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonHillary Clinton says goodbye to 2018: 'A dark time for our country' 2019 forecast: Chaos with a chance of progress What a year it\u2019s been: A month-by-month look back at 2018's biggest stories MORE\u2019s resum\u00e9, to the consternation of the Republican crowd. Before going on to answer how someone with his relative lack of experience could compete with Clinton, Rubio merely laughed and said wryly that Bartiromo had asked a \"great question.\" \n \n Cruz had delivered an especially strong performance at the previous debate, in Boulder, Colo., on Oct 28, and he kept the momentum going here. His responses on entitlement reform and the need to avoid bailing out the financial system again were fluent and clear. \n \n Cruz did have an uncharacteristic misstep when, having stated he would get rid of five government agencies, he in fact named only four. Cruz cited the Department of Commerce twice, but his stumble was immeasurably less damaging than then-Texas Gov.

He hit early on his distrust of the Federal Reserve, an article of faith for the libertarians who backed the presidential bids of his father, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). \n \n He also went after Rubio on the Floridian\u2019s plans for an increased tax credit and then expanded that critique to attack his proposals to increase military spending as well. That clash had no clear winner, but Paul held his own. His strong performance will hardly transform him into a front-runner, but the improvement from his previous showings was notable nonetheless. \n \n Fox Business Network \n \n The debate hosts were always likely to avoid the fate of CNBC, which drew heavy criticism after the Colorado debate, with moderators accused of asking \u201cgotcha\u201d questions and adopting a generally querulous tone. By contrast, Tuesday\u2019s debate was smoothly run and substantive, with the three moderators being neither spineless nor gratuitously rude. The ratings have yet to be revealed, but Fox Business will surely win critical praise for how it ran the show. \n \n New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \n \n After Fox Business decided that only eight contenders would be present on the main stage Tuesday, Christie found himself confined to the undercard debate. If that hurt his pride, it didn\u2019t show. The New Jersey governor was clearly the best performer of the four candidates in the earlier clash, the others being Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.). In particular, Christie turned Jindal\u2019s attacks on his conservative credentials to his advantage, positioning himself as a would-be uniter of the party and Jindal as a petty divider. \n \n MIXED \n \n Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \n \n This was Bush\u2019s best performance in any of the debates so far. Unfortunately for him, that\u2019s a rather low bar. \n \n He did get two effective lines in early, both of which alluded to Clinton. One mocked her sunny assessment of President Obama\u2019s economic record. The other was his insistence that Clinton\u2019s campaign would be \u201cdoing high-fives...right now\u201d after listening to Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump: 'No choice' on continuing government shutdown Syrian troop withdraw will take four months: report Kim Jong Un: North Korea may 'seek a new path' if US doesn't negotiate MORE restate his hard line on illegal immigration. \n \n But there were two big problems for Bush. His performance was marginal for much of the debate \u2014 18 minutes passed at the start before he was asked a question, something he pointed out in a display of assertiveness not seen in the previous debates \u2014 and there was no outstanding moment that seemed likely to reinvigorate his ailing campaign. \n \n Retired surgeon Ben Carson \n \n Carson\u2019s low-wattage style has both fans and detractors, but he is clearly sticking with it. His best moment in the debate came early on when he wryly deflected a question about the media coverage he has received in recent weeks. But Carson can also come across as meandering. Additionally, he ruled out raising the minimum wage despite having indicated in May that he supported such a move. That could spark yet another controversy in a campaign that, for all its strengths, doesn\u2019t need any more of them. \n \n Businesswoman Carly Fiorina \n \n It was more of the same from the former Hewlett Packard CEO. She is a very effective communicator who wraps many of her policy positions in the same overarching theme: that vested interests control the political system and that she is the person to take them on. But the suspicion lingers that Fiorina had her moment in the sun after the second GOP debate in September. She has faded since then, and there\u2019s no apparent reason to believe she can reverse that trend. \n \n Businessman Donald Trump \n \n This was the mogul\u2019s weakest performance in any of the four debates. No single disaster befell him, but he had a couple of bad moments. One came when he complained about Fiorina interrupting other candidates, in the process reminding people of a previous uproar over his comments about her appearance. The other came when, asked about the threat from Russia, he delivered an answer that was conspicuously lacking in detail. Still, Trump remains far ahead in the polls, alongside Carson, despite endless predictions of his imminent demise. Don\u2019t be surprised if his poll ratings prove durable one more time. \n \n LOSERS \n \n Ohio Gov. John Kasich \n \n Kasich needed a big night and he got one \u2014 but in all the wrong ways. Kasich tried to mix it up with several candidates and almost always emerged the loser. Early on, Trump swatted his attacks aside. Much later, he tangled with Cruz on the wisdom of bailing out troubled banks. At one point during that exchange, Kasich appeared to suggest he could decide who should lose their deposits during a bank failure in a financial crisis. Such moments undercut Kasich\u2019s central claim as a pragmatic executive. It was a very bad night for Kasich, and deeper questions are now likely to be asked about the viability of his candidacy.",

Carson's performance was seen as middling, with policy answers lacking in substance, though he did ably deflect a question about the recent controversies over his life story. Jeb Bush. He needed a good night after a dismal performance last month, and opinions are split on whether he delivered. It \"was Bush's best performance in any of the debates so far,\" according to the Hill\u2014but \"unfortunately for him, that's a rather low bar.\" He was more assertive than in previous debates, though it's \"uncertain\" whether that will be enough to give his campaign much of a boost, notes a New York Times assessment. Still, it adds that \"he no longer seemed as desperate to be somewhere else,\" while a Politico analysis has a \"Bush stops the bleeding\" headline and theme. Losers. John Kasich was more of a presence in this debate, but it was not a presence many people liked, with the National Review calling him \"angry, condescending, and unprincipled\" and likening him to \"the drunk, obnoxious uncle everyone wishes hadn't accepted the invitation to Thanksgiving dinner.\" Trump's performance was seen as his weakest yet, and Politico says he \"committed perhaps the biggest gaffe of the night\" by suggesting wages in America are too high. Fox Business Network. Unlike CNBC's widely criticized debate, Fox's debate was seen as \"fair and balanced,\" with candidates receiving a roughly equal amount of speaking time, ranging from 13 minutes 35 seconds for Cruz to 9 minutes 22 seconds for Carson, according to Politico. \"And that @CNBC is how you run a debate,\" tweeted RNC chairman Reince Priebus.

Here's what the pundits are saying: \"Jeb Bush, who entered Tuesday night's GOP debate with the most on the line, rose to the occasion and turned in his strongest debate performance to date,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"While Bush's ability to find his footing on the primetime stage should reassure nervous donors, it's unlikely to fundamentally change his position in the broader field\u2014a B grade, after all, only brings \u2013 Tuesday night's GOP debate in Milwaukee may have been the last before the Iowa caucuses, but it wasn't without its share of memorable moments. Here's a look at some of the lines generating the most buzz: Marco Rubio: \"I know that Rand is a committed isolationist. I know that the world is a safer and a better place when the United States is the strongest country in the world.\" Rand Paul: \"Marco, Marco, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure to the federal government?\u201d Paul shot back. \u201cYou cannot be a conservative if you\u2019re going to keep promoting \u2013 Tuesday night's GOP debate in Milwaukee wasn't as heated as the previous three, but there were still plenty of memorable moments. Here's what the pundits are saying: Ben Carson was \"more energetic (that's a pretty low bar given Carson's past performances) and more dialed in than I had seen him,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"He was helped by a moderator question on his past exaggerations/inaccuracies regarding his life story that would give the term 'softball' a bad name.\" Marco Rubio \"knocked it out of the park when debating military \u2013 The first Republican debate of the 2016 election is in the books, and the consensus seems to be that Donald Trump was the biggest loser. Here's what the pundits are saying: Trump was \"off his game,\" according to Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"When he did get time to speak, he simply repeated his now-familiar lines\u2014we don't win anymore, I have a great company, etc.\u2014and little else. His answers on foreign policy were not good. His random attack on Fiorina\u2014'why does she keep interrupting everybody?'\u2014earned him boos from the crowd \u2013 Tuesday night's debate was the first for Fox Business Network, and while the eight GOP candidates didn't exactly go on the attack, they did go at each other on issues including immigration and defense spending. Here's what the pundits are saying: \"It was a debate about policy,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"There were no knockout punches, no major gaffes, no made-for-opposition-research moments. Each of the candidates went silent for a stretch, but none completely disappeared as in previous debates\u2014perhaps because the stage had shrunk to only eight, the smallest primetime grouping \u2013 Tuesday night's GOP debate was the last before the Iowa caucuses take place in two weeks, and the front-runners\u2014Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich\u2014were all on the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Here's what the pundits are saying: Trump was \"by far the biggest star of the debate,\" according to Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post, who notes that he was \"on top of the board from the get-go.\" He \"never lost his temper, his focus, or his sense of humor,\" and \" \u2013 The two biggest talking points from last night's GOP debate were Marco Rubio's claim that he could beat Donald Trump in a head-to-head race and Ted Cruz's assertion that he was the only conservative who could beat Trump. Here's a look at some of the post-debate analysis: \"The reality that the night seemed not to move the needle in any significant direction was apparent from the tone and body language of campaign officials,\" writes Eliana Johnson at the National Review. \"Everyone took to the spin room looking pleased and relaxed if not especially triumphant or dejected, all of them satisfied with their candidate \u2013 The results of last night's Wisconsin primary are in, and they're not good news for anyone running for president. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called the race for Ted Cruz about an hour after the polls closed, and the GOP senator from Texas had a double-digit lead over the rest of the field. Here's what the pundits are saying: \"It was a good night for Cruz,\" writes Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post. \"He\u2019s now within striking distance of the magic delegate number of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (which he needs to avoid a brokered convention).\" \u2013 After a rocky few months for Jeb Bush's campaign, Tuesday night's debate was seen as a step in the right direction. Here's what the pundits are saying: Bush \"was a feistier and more assertive combatant, demanding more time from moderators, offering flashes of improvised humor and delivering crisper answers than he has in the past,\" writes Eliana Johnson at the Washington Post. \"He seemed, at times, more commanding,\" writes Tim Alberta at the National Review, though \"there were clenched smiles, obscure geographical references and hands that reflexively darted into his pockets.\" Bush \"generated a handful of \u2013 After last night's debate, Jeb Bush has a word of advice for his rivals: Don't make the same mistake he did. In an interview with the New York Times, Bush says he's learned a lot from the debate. \"I think the biggest lesson is that you have to be able to tell the truth,\" he says. \"You can't just say the same thing over and over. You have to have a plan.\" Bush, who hired debate coach Jon Kraushar last month, says he learned that \"answer the question you want, not the one you were asked\" during sessions with Kraus \u2013 After his terrible showing in the last debate, Jeb Bush spent the days leading up to last night's debate working to lower expectations and calm nerves, Politico reports. His campaign manager said Bush had been working with new debate coach Jon Kraushar, who specializes in helping clients connect with TV viewers, last week. His team even got in on the action with a conference call with New York donors. \"There's always nervous Nellies in every campaign,\" says former Sen. Mel Martinez, a Bush supporter. \"If they needed it, tonight certainly should have reassured them. This can be the start of a turnaround if he \u2013 Jeb Bush's camp is calling last night's debate a \"turning point\" for the candidate\u2014and it wasn't because he turned in a strong performance. Rather, it was because he changed his posture, brought in a top adviser who can help candidates connect with TV viewers, and went after Donald Trump more aggressively, Politico reports. \"I think last night was a turning point for him,\" says an adviser. \"He was more aggressive, he was more confident, and he looked like he was in a much better place than he had in the first three debates.\" Bush also brought in an adviser who specializes in \u2013 Tuesday night's GOP debate in Milwaukee was the last before the Iowa caucuses take place on Feb. 10, and analysts say it was a more substantive affair than the previous three debates\u2014and one that was won by four candidates.

    "document": "Shia LaBeouf won't be making his Broadway debut this season after all. The 26-year-old actor has quit the upcoming revival production of the play \"Orphans\" in New York over \"creative differences,\" according to a news release sent Wednesday. \n \n LaBeouf has left the show a month before preview performances are set to begin. \"Orphans\" is still scheduled to open at the Schoenfeld Theater on April 7, with previews commencing on March 19. The production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, also features Alec Baldwin, in the role of a powerful man kidnapped by two brothers. \n \n Wednesday's announcement did not elaborate on the nature of the creative differences that led to LaBeouf's departure, and no replacement for the actor has been announced. \n \n \"Orphans,\" by Lyle Kessler, debuted in 1983 at the Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles and is often revived at regional theaters across the country. Director Alan Pakula turned it into a movie in 1987, with a cast that included Albert Finney, Matthew Modine and Kevin Anderson. \n \n In 2005, Al Pacino appeared in a workshop production of the play, alongside Jesse Eisenberg, at the Greenway Court Theatre in L.A. \n \n LaBeouf rose to fame starring in the \"Transformers\" action movies and the most recent \"Indiana Jones\" installment. But the actor made waves earlier this year by saying that he is swearing off Hollywood blockbusters in favor of riskier, indie-flavor projects. \n \n He had virtually no theater experience going into \"Orphans.\" He began his career doing stand-up comedy, eventually landing a role on the Disney Channel program \"Even Stevens.\" \n \n His next movies include Robert Redford's \"The Company You Keep\" and Lars von Trier's \"Nymphomaniac.\" \n \n RELATED: \n \n David Mamet's 'The Anarchist': What did the critics think? \n \n Al Pacino in 'Glengarry Glen Ross': What did the critics think? \n \n Where's LaBeouf? Shia heading to Broadway, with Alec Baldwin ||||| Tom Hanks swears. Not a blue streak, no, but it\u2019s bracing to hear profanity from the man who has defined decency for three decades in Hollywood, playing white knights in \u201cSplash,\u201d \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cApollo 13\u201d and the \u201cToy Story\u201d series. If he is grandma-friendly on screen, he is looser and less predictable in person \u2014 as his old friend Nora Ephron was reminded several years ago when she sent him the screenplay for a biopic, \u201cLucky Guy.\u201d Mr. Hanks took an instant dislike to his character, Mike McAlary, the muckraking columnist of New York City tabloids in the 1980s and \u201990s. \n \n \u201cI told Nora that McAlary sounded like a real\u201d jerk, Mr. Hanks said, using a more piquant word \u2014 and a perceptive one, since McAlary\u2019s power came from his determination to be the biggest, baddest, bona fide ... jerk who ever dug into corrupt cops. \n \n Mr. Hanks reconsidered only years later, after running into Ephron while promoting his 2011 movie \u201cLarry Crowne.\u201d He was a co-writer, a star and the director of that picture, and it was a critical and commercial disappointment. Ephron, by contrast, represented happier days, during their collaborations on \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d \n \n They got around to talking about \u201cLucky Guy\u201d \u2014 she had turned it into a play, and Hugh Jackman had done a table reading \u2014 and Mr. Hanks asked to see the latest version. This time he felt drawn not only to McAlary\u2019s swagger, but also his drive to become the next Jimmy Breslin and to be worthy of his own celebrity. \n \n \u201cLook, the title is \u2018Lucky Guy.\u2019 It\u2019s about somebody who is almost good enough to deserve what he achieves. And I understand that,\u201d Mr. Hanks said during an interview on the stage of the Broadhurst Theater, where the play, his Broadway debut, is set to begin its 15-week run on Friday. \n \n \u201cI still feel sometimes that I\u2019d like to be as good as so-and-so actor,\u201d he continued. \u201cI see some other actors\u2019 work, and I think I\u2019ll never get there. I wish I could.\u201d \n \n Hollywood stars often come to Broadway to prove something to themselves or to audiences, though they rarely admit it. With Academy Awards for \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d and \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d Mr. Hanks is less hesitant. While he denied that, at 56, he is here because his film career has cooled \u2014 \u201cI have two movies in the can. I have plenty to keep me busy\u201d \u2014 he also appeared delighted that McAlary is pretty far from a predictable Tom Hanks part. \n \n Will audiences buy him as unlikable? Mr. Hanks is still a genial guy, who tends to cope with pressure by yukking it up. But he has also thrown himself into a role that calls for no vanity, his director and fellow actors say. He has a gray-flecked mustache, as did McAlary, and is trying to preserve the columnist\u2019s rough edges. \n \n \u201cAnytime you go off to do something new, you\u2019ve involved in a reinvention, and any actor who says otherwise is just trying to lower expectations,\u201d said Mr. Hanks, who trained to be a theater actor in the 1970s but quickly moved on to television and then movies. \n \n It has been a twisting path to Broadway for Mr. Hanks and \u201cLucky Guy,\u201d and a heartbreaking one. The sharp-elbowed McAlary, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for his columns about the brutalization of Abner Louima by police officers, died later that year from colon cancer, at the age of 41. Soon after, Ephron, a former reporter for The New York Post who cherished the tabloids of yesteryear, began to research McAlary\u2019s life and spent years rewriting the script, at one point calling it \u201cStories About McAlary.\u201d \n \n Once Mr. Hanks signed on, Ephron began meeting weekly with the play\u2019s director, the Tony Award winner George C. Wolfe (\u201cAngels in America\u201d), to sharpen the central device \u2014 other journalists sharing and arguing over anecdotes about McAlary \u2014 so that the lead character came into sharper focus. All the while, however, Ephron was quietly battling leukemia; to the shock of her \u201cLucky Guy\u201d collaborators and many friends, she died last June, at 71. \n \n \u201cNora was turning around new drafts of the play in a week, and it was confusing to me why she was working so quickly,\u201d Mr. Wolfe said. \u201cI had no awareness of the invisible timetable she was on. After she died, we were even more determined to do the play.\u201d \n \n Writers are a pretty hands-on lot, especially with new works going to Broadway. Without Ephron, Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Hanks have become keepers of the \u201cLucky Guy\u201d flame. Aside from Ephron\u2019s script, there are pages of discarded dialogue that Mr. Wolfe has cherry-picked for an extra dash of nuance or sprinkle of clarity. \u201cMy motto is, \u2018When in doubt, reference Nora,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Wolfe said, and he has done so with the blessing of her widower, the writer Nicholas Pileggi. \n \n Mr. Hanks, meanwhile, read many of McAlary\u2019s columns and interviewed some of his old friends, coming away agreeing with a point Ephron once made about him. \u201cNora said Mac was good when he was covering the stuff he knew, cops and cop scandals, while other times he was clearly struggling,\u201d he recalled. \n \n Seeing those imperfections has helped him avoid turning McAlary into a classically uplifting Hanks role. Or, as he put it bluntly: \u201cnot to\u201d screw \u201cthis up.\u201d",

    "document": "KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan will accept a Taliban liaison office in Qatar to start peace talks but no foreign power can get involved in the process without its consent, the government's peace council said, as efforts gather pace to find a solution to the decade-long war. \n \n Afghanistan's High Peace Council, in a note to foreign missions, has set out ground rules for engaging the Taliban after Kabul grew concerned that the United States and Qatar, helped by Germany, had secretly agreed with the Taliban to open an office in the Qatari capital, Doha. \n \n U.S. officials have held about half a dozen meetings with their insurgent contacts, mostly in Germany and Doha with representatives of Mullah Omar, leader of the Taliban's Quetta Shura, this year to prepare the way for face-to-face talks between the group and the Afghan government. \n \n A representative office for the group is considered the starting point for such talks and Doha has in the past served as a meeting ground for initial contacts. \n \n But the Afghan peace commission which has suffered a series of setbacks including the assassination of its head in September said that negotiations with the Taliban could only begin after they stopped violence against civilians, cut ties to al Qaeda, and accepted the Afghan constitution which guarantees civil rights and liberties, including rights for women. \n \n The council, according to a copy of the 11-point note made available to Reuters, also said any peace process with the Taliban would have to have the support of Pakistan since members of the insurgent group were based there. \n \n \"The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is in agreement regarding the opening of an office for the armed opposition, but only to move forward the peace process and conduct negotiations,\" the council said. \n \n The government would prefer such an office in either Saudi Arabia or Turkey, both of which it is close to, but was not averse to Doha as long as the authority of the Afghan state was not eroded and the office was only established for talks, officials said. \n \n \"We are saying Saudi or Turkey are preferable, we are not saying it has to be there only. The only condition is it should be in an Islamic country,\" said a government official. \n \n President Hamid Karzai's administration recalled its ambassador from Doha last week, apparently angry that it had been kept in the dark about the latest round of contacts with the insurgent group. \n \n Officials said Kabul was also deeply concerned about reports that the United States was considering the transfer of a small number of Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay military prison to Doha as a prelude to the talks. \n \n \"We are a sovereign country, we have laws. How can you transfer our prisoners from one country to another. Already it's a violation to have them in Guantanamo Bay,\" the official said. \n \n The Afghan government wanted the prisoners to be returned to its custody, the official said. \n \n Reuters reported this month that the United States was considering the transfer of an unspecified number of Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay into Afghan government custody as part of accelerating, high-stakes diplomacy. \n \n \"We have no problem with this. In fact we have been demanding this for a while. These are Afghan prisoners,\" said the official, who declined to be identified. \n \n The tension between the Karzai administration and the United States over engaging the Taliban underscores the challenges of seeking a political settlement as the West prepares to withdraw most combat troops from the country by 2014. \n \n Efforts to engage the insurgent group have faced a string of setbacks, the most recent being the assassination of the head of the peace council and former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, in September at the hands of a suicide bomber who pretended to be a Taliban emissary. \n \n HARDENING OF POSITIONS \n \n It led to a hardening of positions with Karzai saying the government could not talk to suicide bombers and that there should be an address for the Taliban so that negotiators know they are talking to the right representatives. \n \n \"We are committed to the reconciliation process, the experience of the last 10 years shows no military solution is possible. Talking to the armed opposition is the key in this regard,\" said presidential spokesman Aimal Faizi. \n \n White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the United States backed steps toward reconciliation that bring Afghans together and allow insurgents eschewing violence and abiding by the Afghan constitution to come off the battlefield. \n \n \"We will join initiatives that support Afghan-led reconciliation. Pakistan also has an important role to play in supporting the Afghan-led process,\" she said. \n \n A State Department official added Washington will continue to work very closely with Kabul authorities to draw in Taliban fighters who break from al Qaeda terrorists and agree to respect the rights of Afghans, including women and ethnic minorities. \n \n \"We believe it is in the interests of both of our countries, as well as the region as whole, to work together to support a stable, secure, and prosperous Afghanistan inside a stable, secure, and prosperous region,\" the State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \n The Afghan peace council, laying down the markers for engagement with the Taliban, said well known figures from both the Taliban and the government had to be involved in talks. \n \n It said that \"before any negotiations can take place, violence against Afghan people must stop and that the armed opposition must cut ties to al Qaeda and other terrorist groups\". \n \n It also said that the Taliban must accept the constitution and honor the gains made in the last 10 years since they were ousted from power, conditions that the Taliban have shown no sign of accepting. \n \n The Taliban do not accept the constitution and have vowed to carry on fighting until all foreign troops have left the country. \n \n The peace council said Pakistani support was necessary for talks to take place, another condition that makes the task harder because of fraught ties between the United States and Pakistan which fears it is being shut out of the process. \n \n Opening a Taliban office in a third country is seen as a way to create distance from Pakistan which has longstanding ties to the insurgent group. \n \n But the government official said he did not think the peace council had laid down such tough conditions that the talks would fail even before they started. \n \n \"We don't think it's a deal breaker. We are quite optimistic,\" he said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Laura MacInnis in Honolulu and Alister Bull and Jim Wolf in Washington; Editing by Robert Birsel, Ed Lane and Sandra Maler) ||||| An Afghan government body seeking a negotiated peace deal with the Taliban insisted Monday it would not tolerate foreign interference in any talks. \n \n The head of the foreign relations department of the High Peace Council, Mohammad Ismail Qasimyar, emphasized the government's position in reaction to Afghan media reports that the U.S. and other foreign governments with a stake in the war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban. \n \n \"Afghans must be in the lead in the talks,\" Qasimyar told The Associated Press. \"No foreign involvement in the Afghan peace talks is acceptable.\" \n \n The peace council is a group of about 70 influential Afghans and former Taliban appointed by President Hamid Karzai to try to reconcile with the insurgents. The former head of the council, Burhanuddin Rabbani, was assassinated on Sept. 20. Rabbani, a former president of Afghanistan, was killed by a suicide bomber posing as a peace emissary from the Taliban. \n \n After Rabbani's death, Karzai said peace efforts could only take place if the Taliban established a political office that would be authorized to conduct talks on a peaceful end to the 10-year war. He proposed that it be set up in Saudi Arabia or in Turkey if the insurgent movement did not want to establish it in Afghanistan. \n \n The Taliban have not publicly responded to Karzai's demands. The insurgents, who perceive themselves as winning the war, have repeatedly said they would not engage in peace talks with the government while foreign troops remain on Afghan soil. \n \n On Monday, the Taliban repeated that they were confident of ultimate victory and said that the NATO forces would face the same fate as the Soviet invaders who withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 after an almost decade-long war. \n \n The insurgents \"are successfully withstanding all the coalition forces led by the U.S. invaders and will make them all face the same fate that befell the Red Army,\" said statement marking the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet invasion in 1979. \n \n Meanwhile, a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform opened fire on coalition troops in western Afghanistan, military authorities said Monday. Several coalition troops were wounded and the gunman was killed, said an official who asked not to be named because the investigation was ongoing. \n \n The shooting took place Saturday at an outpost in Bala Boluk district, about 340 miles (700 kilometers) west of Kabul, said Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi. A NATO statement said there were no fatalities among alliance soldiers. \n \n If the probe confirms the gunman was a soldier, the shooting would be the latest in a series of attacks by Afghans against coalition partners. Those shootings have raised fears of Taliban infiltration as NATO speeds up the training of Afghan security forces. \n \n The expansion of the army and police is a critical element in NATO's exit strategy from Afghanistan. \n \n Coalition troops are to end their combat role in 2014, and the goal is to have 195,000 trained Afghan troops in service by next October. \n \n ___ \n \n Slobodan Lekic can be reached on Twitter at http://twitter.com/slekich",

    "document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Monday that farmers could not use Monsanto\u2019s patented genetically altered soybeans to create new seeds without paying the company a fee. \n \n The ruling has implications for many aspects of modern agriculture and for businesses based on vaccines, cell lines and software. But Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, emphasized that the decision was narrow. \n \n \u201cOur holding today is limited \u2014 addressing the situation before us, rather than every one involving a self-replicating product,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex and diverse. In another case, the article\u2019s self-replication might occur outside the purchaser\u2019s control. Or it might be a necessary but incidental step in using the item for another purpose.\u201d \n \n But Justice Kagan had little difficulty ruling that an Indiana farmer\u2019s conduct in the case before the court, Bowman v. Monsanto Company, No. 11-796, had run afoul of patent law. \n \n Farmers who buy Monsanto\u2019s patented seeds must generally sign a contract promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, which means they must buy new seeds every year. The seeds are valuable because they are resistant to the herbicide Roundup, itself a Monsanto product. \n \n But the Indiana farmer, Vernon Hugh Bowman, who had signed such contracts for his main crop, said he discovered a loophole for a second, riskier crop later in the growing season. \n \n For that second crop, he bought seeds from a grain elevator filled with a mix of seeds in the reasonable hope that many of them contained Monsanto\u2019s patented Roundup Ready gene. \n \n Seeds from grain elevators are typically sold for animal feed, food processing or industrial uses. But Mr. Bowman planted them and sprayed them with Roundup. Many plants survived, and he replanted their seeds. \n \n Monsanto sued, and a federal judge in Indiana ordered Mr. Bowman to pay the company more than $84,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent cases, upheld that decision, saying that by planting the seeds Mr. Bowman had infringed Monsanto\u2019s patents. \n \n Justice Kagan agreed, suggesting that Mr. Bowman had been too clever for his own good. \n \n Mr. Bowman\u2019s main argument was that a doctrine called patent exhaustion allowed him to do what he liked with products he had obtained legally. But Justice Kagan said it did not apply to the way he had used the seeds. \n \n \u201cUnder the patent exhaustion doctrine, Bowman could resell the patented soybeans he purchased from the grain elevator; so too he could consume the beans himself or feed them to his animals,\u201d she wrote. \n \n \u201cBut the exhaustion doctrine does not enable Bowman to make additional patented soybeans without Monsanto\u2019s permission,\u201d she added, and went on to say that \u201cthat is precisely what Bowman did.\u201d \n \n Justice Kagan said that allowing Mr. Bowman\u2019s tactic would destroy the value of Monsanto\u2019s patent. \u201cThe exhaustion doctrine is limited to the \u2018particular item\u2019 sold,\u201d she wrote, \u201cto avoid just such a mismatch between invention and reward.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Bowman acknowledged the general principle that he had no right to make a new product with Monsanto\u2019s seeds. But he said he had used the seeds precisely as they were intended to be used \u2014 planting them \u201cin the normal way farmers do,\u201d Justice Kagan wrote. \n \n Accepting that theory, she wrote, would create an \u201cunprecedented exception\u201d to the exhaustion doctrine. \u201cIf simple copying were a protected use,\u201d she wrote, \u201ca patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the item containing the invention.\u201d \n \n Mr. Bowman also argued in briefs that soybeans naturally \u201cself-replicate or \u2018sprout\u2019 unless stored in a controlled manner,\u201d meaning that \u201cit was the planted soybean, not Bowman,\u201d that created the new seeds. \n \n Justice Kagan rejected what she called \u201cthat blame-the-bean defense.\u201d \n \n \u201cBowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans\u2019 multiplication,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cPut another way, the seeds he purchased (miraculous though they might be in other respects) did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt was Bowman, and not the bean,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwho controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto\u2019s patented invention.\u201d ||||| Indiana farmer's effort to replicate soybeans that are resistant to weed killer is determined to be a patent infringement. \n \n The entrance to the Monsanto Company, headquartered in St. Louis, is seen in 2005. (Photo: James A. Finley, AP) Story Highlights Unanimous ruling protects biotechnology entrepreneurs from predators \n \n Justices gave little credence to Indiana farmer's argument \n \n Ruling does not settle all future cases involving self-replicating products \n \n WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court usually isn't friendly toward questionable patents, but it came down overwhelmingly on the side of agribusiness giant Monsanto Monday in a case that's bound to resonate throughout the biotechnology industry. \n \n The court ruled unanimously that an Indiana farmer violated Monsanto's patent on genetically modified soybeans when he culled some from a grain elevator and used them to replant his own crop in future years. \n \n \"If simple copying were a protected use, a patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the first item containing the invention,\" Justice Elena Kagan ruled in a short 10-page opinion. \"The undiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend not for 20 years as the Patent Act promises, but for only one transaction. And that would result in less incentive for innovation than Congress wanted.\" \n \n Who it helps: Inventors and entrepreneurs who have patents on products that can be self-replicated, from computer software to cell lines. While Kagan's decision is limited to the Monsanto case, it bolsters the argument that self-replicating products can be protected from patent infringement even if their challengers go through third parties. \n \n Who it hurts: Consumers paying high prices. The Center for Food Safety released a report in February that showed three corporations control much of the global commercial seed market. It found that from 1995-2011, the average cost to plant 1 acre of soybeans rose 325%. \n \n What's to come: Still pending is a decision on whether human genes can be patented. That case tests a company's patent on the genes that can identify an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. During oral arguments in April, the justices seemed far more skeptical of the merits of that patent. \n \n Monsanto's soybeans represent the cream of the crop because they are resistant to the weed killer Roundup. Farmers must pay Monsanto's price to plant the beans themselves. \n \n That's not what Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman did. After one year of going through Monsanto, he bought his second crop from a grain elevator. Then he used his own soybeans that resisted Roundup in future years -- in essence, the court said, making copies of a patented invention. \n \n Bowman's attorney, Mark Walters, had argued that the Monsanto seeds were acquired innocently enough from the grain elevator, and that Bowman's little operation never would threaten the company's monopoly. \n \n Two lower federal courts weren't impressed with Bowman's case, ruling in favor of Monsanto. And that argument carried little weight with the justices when the case was argued in February. They noted that Monsanto had spent hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade to perfect its soybeans -- something it would not have done if others could so easily replicate them. \n \n Bowman contended the soybeans were \"self-replicating,\" but Kagan said that \"blame-the-bean defense\" wasn't worthy. \n \n \"Bowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans' multiplication,\" she said. \"Or, put another way, the seeds he purchased, miraculous though they might be in other respects, did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops. \n \n \"It was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention,\" Kagan said. \n \n Monsanto officials applauded the decision, not just for the company but for innovators of all shapes and sizes. \n \n \"The court's ruling today ensures that longstanding principles of patent law apply to breakthrough 21st century technologies that are central to meeting the growing demands of our planet and its people,\" said David F. Snively, the company's executive vice president. \"The ruling also provides assurance to all inventors throughout the public and private sectors that they can and should continue to invest in innovation that feeds people, improves lives, creates jobs, and allows America to keep its competitive edge.\" \n \n Jim Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said the ruling will benefit all forms of biotechnology, \"as well as the patients, farmers and consumers who benefit from biotechnology's help in healing, feeding and fueling the world.\" \n \n But Center for Food Safety executive director Andrew Kimbrell called the ruling a setback for farmers. \"The court chose to protect Monsanto over farmers,\" he said. \"The court's ruling is contrary to logic and to agronomics, because it improperly attributes seeds' reproduction to farmers, rather than nature.\" \n \n Fordham University School of Law professor Mark Patterson noted the decision stops short of determining how self-reproducing inventions should be handled in all cases. \n \n \"Justice Kagan, in the last paragraph of the opinion, noted that 'such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse,'\" Patterson said. \"Either the court or Congress will have to address them again soon.\" \n \n Follow @richardjwolf on Twitter. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/165FPGy",

Seventy-six-year-old farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman has lost his Supreme Court battle with Monsanto over his use of patented soybean seeds, the New York Times reports. The court upheld an $84,000 lawsuit brought against Bowman by the agribusiness giant for growing and saving its seeds without paying a fee. Bowman had obtained the seeds from a grain elevator intended for animal feed, and argued that a doctrine called \"patent exhaustion\" allowed him to do as he pleased with the grain once he had purchased it. This may be true if he wanted to eat the seeds, but Justice Elena Kagan ruled that it does not extend to growing more seeds and replanting them without paying Monsanto for their use. But this case was about more than a few soybeans.

Her mysterious snake videos hint yes \n \n CLOSE Taylor Swift shared a cryptic video snippet Monday across her social media accounts of a snake. USA TODAY \n \n Yep, it's a snake. \n \n Taylor Swift continues to tease fans with mysterious videos on social media, her first posts since wiping her accounts on Friday. \n \n Just after 11 a.m. ET on Monday, Swift posted a ten-second video of what appears to be a snake's tail on Instagram and Twitter. \n \n On Tuesday, around the same time, she posted a second clip of the snake. \n \n On Wednesday, the snake finally reared its head in an additional, heavily-CGI'd video. With the tail, middle and head of the snake all represented, fans were left guessing whether Thursday will actually bring new music. \n \n The posts are the first updates on Swift's social media sites since her official pages were blacked out (including Twitter, Instagram and her own website) prompting speculation of a new album announcement. \n \n Coincidentally, last Friday marked the three-year anniversary of Swift's Shake It Off release and 1989 album announcement, hinting that her much-anticipated sixth album may be around the corner. \n \n More: Taylor Swift erased from social media and fans can't shake it off \n \n Joseph Kahn, Swift's go-to music video director, quoted her tweet with a smiley-face and cracked a joke about Monday's solar eclipse, with many Internet commenters speculating that the two events were related. \n \n In 30 minutes, as a show of power, @taylorswift13 will blot out the sun. \u2014 Joseph Kahn (@JosephKahn) August 21, 2017 \n \n Tswift trying to eclipse the eclipse https://t.co/0fThmqPB6n \u2014 Sydney Esiason (@sydneyesiason) August 21, 2017 \n \n Only Taylor Swift could out hype a solar eclipse\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb https://t.co/ZvGP8mlRxR \u2014 Brooklyn and Bailey (@BrookAndBailey) August 21, 2017 \n \n As fans have pointed out, Taylor has been associated with snake imagery since her drama with Kim Kardashian last year. Right around the time Kardashian \"exposed\" Swift on social media, she tweeted a string of snake emoji, which fans interpreted as her taking shots at Swift. \n \n And earlier this year, Swift fans commemorate the anniversary of the drama by celebrating \"National Snake Day\" on July 17 as a holiday in Swift's honor. \n \n Twitter had plenty of jokes about Taylor embracing the snake. \n \n Instead of being very much excluded from this narrative, I guess she's owning it https://t.co/WhxLTA4FUv \u2014 Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) August 23, 2017 \n \n No way...is Taylor Swift leaning totally into her supposed \"snake\" role people love giving her?!

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| About \n \n \"Taylor Swift Is a Snake\" is a catchphrase used to smear the American pop singer-songwriter as a deceitful manipulator in the light of her post-breakup dispute with Calvin Harris, Scottish musician and her ex-boyfriend, as well as an unrelated controversy stemming from her reaction to the lyrics of Kanye West's 2016 rap single \"Famous\", both of which became high publicized in July 2016. The phrase is mainly used in the form of emoji and comment spamming on her Instagram account. \n \n Origin \n \n The rocky relationship between Taylor Swift and Kanye West began with the latter's infamous interruption of Swift\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. A few years later, the two musicians seemed to have reconciled their differences at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, with Taylor Swift confirming that there were no hard feelings between them in an interview with MTV, while Kanye West publicly apologized for his previous stunt during his acceptance speech for the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Then in late June 2016, another feud arose between the two following the release of the music video for \"Famous,\" the first single from Kanye West's seventh studio album The Life of Pablo. \n \n \n \n \n \n The music video quickly became a popular subject of gossips and media attention due to its inclusion of provocative imageries of celebrities and public figures, as well as lyrical references alluding to his \n \n I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex \n \n Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn) \n \n I made that bitch famous \n \n \n \n \n \n Spread \n \n Taylor Swift's Response \n \n In response, Taylor Swift claimed she was offended and never approved the lyrics. But Kanye West claimed she did approve the lyrics, with Swift and her supporters denying the claim. \n \n Kim Kardashian's Snapchat Video \n \n However, on July 18th, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West's wife, uploaded videos on SnapChat of Kanye West and Taylor Swift having the conversation (which she then uploaded to her Instagram account). \n \n Online Reaction \n \n Since then, there were various reactions to videos, with hashtags on twitter like #KimExposedTaylorParty and #TaylorIsASnake started being used. Various websites and media outlets like BuzzFeed and 4chan's /mu/ (music) have been discussing and reporting on the drama and creating various image macros on the subject. \n \n Justin Bieber's Instagram Post \n \n On August 2nd, Justin Bieber posted a mobile screenshot of himself video chatting with Kanye West via FaceTime to his Instagram account, along with the caption that simply read \"Taylor swift what up.\" Within the first 12 hours, the post garnered over 1.5 million likes and 135,000 comments. \n \n \n \n \n \n Taylor swift what up. \n \n Bieber's dry greeting was largely interpreted as a subtle diss towards Swift in the light of her recent feud with West and it subsequently triggered a massive flood of spam comments on Taylor Swift's Instagram posts, in a very similar way to the raid that ensued on Miley Cyrus' Instagram account after Nicki Minaj confronted her by saying \"Miley, What's Good?\" during her acceptance speech for the Best Hip Hop Video Award at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. \n \n Snake Video \n \n On August 21st, 2017, Swift tweeted a short glitched video of what appeared to be a snake's tail on her Instagram and Twitter accounts (shown below). Since the video marked the artist's first social media since her accounts had been purged of all content, many speculated that it may have signaled a new album in the works. Meanwhile, others on Twitter made jokes about the video post coinciding with the 2017 solar eclipse. \n \n \n \n \n \n Examples \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Search Interest \n \n External References ||||| The new era of Taylor Swift is HERE, so please cancel all your plans and pray for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

Three days later, speculation is only growing after the singer posted a nearly inscrutable video to Instagram and Twitter. Is new music on the way? What kind of music will it be? Or, seriously, is this just a cry for help? The Ringer staff launched into full conspiracy mode and put forth their most viable theories. \n \n A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 21, 2017 at 8:00am PDT \n \n Justin Charity: Taylor Swift tweeting tentacle porn and we just acting like it\u2019s normal. \n \n Lindsay Zoladz: Look, it\u2019s a snake. Do not tell me that someone as image-conscious as Taylor Swift didn\u2019t Rorschach-test this on 50 of her closest besties to confirm that it does indeed look like a snake, which of course indicates that her new song will have something to do with the infamous Taylor-Kimye feud. \n \n I truly hope Taylor proves me wrong, though. This is already a precarious time for someone like Taylor Swift to be releasing new music\u2014what with the foundation of American democracy crumbling and all\u2014and it would be an especially petty time for her to microwave some year-old beef and pick a fight with another celebrity. Nobody needs \u201cBad Blood II\u201d right now\u2014the only person I\u2019m interested in hearing a T-Swift dis track about is Donald Trump. \n \n Amanda Dobbins: My first thought, just like everybody else, was that it\u2019s a snake. Fine; I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s gonna get through this press cycle without addressing the Kim/Kanye fiasco, and if she can have a sense of humor about it, all the better. Here\u2019s my issue: Why are you releasing this in the literal middle of the internet\u2019s Eclipse Insanity? I assume that this tease is related to the upcoming VMAs, and that Taylor is contractually obligated to promote her Single Release\u2013Katy Perry Peace Summit (it\u2019s happening, they both need the ratings) throughout the week. But there is no reason that can\u2019t wait until Tuesday, when the press cycle is free and clear of eye-burning memes and Game of Thrones complaints. This is my problem with late-period Taylor\u2014not the whining, which has always been part of her brand, but how incompetent the dissemination of said whining is. Get your messaging together. It\u2019s 2017. \n \n Michael Baumann: \n \n Andrew Gruttadaro: In ancient Greece\u2014likely around 585 B.C.\u2014a solar eclipse occurred during a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, inspiring the factions to put down their weapons and declare peace. In the United States of America\u2014in the year 2017 A.D.\u2014musician Taylor Swift saw that a solar eclipse was coming and picked up her weapons and aimed them at the famed tribe of the Kardashians. People interpret omens differently. [Shrugs.] \n \n Kate Knibbs: Remember when people kept leaving snake emoji on Taylor Swift's (now-deleted) Instagram posts? I barely do, because last summer feels like it happened 5,000 years ago and on a different planet, so to refresh: Taylor Swift bashed Kanye West's lyrics about her in \"Famous.\" Kim Kardashian West then posted a video on Snapchat showing Kanye on the phone with Taylor, who seemed to approve of the song. And thus Taylor was branded a snake, a disingenuous conniver. \n \n And now, after a low-profile 2017, Swift has deleted all her social media posts and uploaded a single, undulating reptile tail. It probably means that she's going to release new music, but I also hope it means that she's going to release new music and she's decided to set aside her gee-golly wallflower ingenue persona for good and embrace a public image that more accurately reflects her personality. Swift's a Slytherin. She muscled her way into songwriting fame by masterminding insanely catchy songs that simultaneously trashed the reputations of men who had wronged her. She got caught either flat-out lying or at least exaggerating for sympathy. Look what she did to Tom Hiddleston. \n \n Secretly Bad Taylor was no fun. It's time for Openly Bad Taylor. More feuds, more drama, absolutely no more hangouts with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. Instead of denying her snake side, I hope this weird video of a snake\u2019s butt means that Taylor Swift has decided to lean into her true trickster nature. \n \n Jordan Coley: Those close to me have probably heard me saying this privately for months, but after Taylor Swift\u2019s cryptic Instagram post Monday morning, I figured it was time I brought this theory forward. Prior to Monday morning\u2019s post, Swift had not really posted anything on her Instagram in many months. She was noticeably absent during the election and was nowhere to be found at the Grammys this past February. This is, of course, because Taylor Swift is trapped in the Upside Down. Yes, the dark, lifeless parallel reality that Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things famously brought to our attention. But didn\u2019t she make that video for Russell Westbrook? Nope, we all know the NBA is rigged; that video was recorded before the season even started. But didn\u2019t she promote Lorde and Haim\u2019s new releases on Instagram? Pfft\u2014automated PR content from her label. Listen, Taylor\u2019s trapped down there, and whatever\u2019s down there with her doesn\u2019t look too friendly. Monday morning\u2019s post was a cry for help. Now, we can either sit around and do nothing, or get off our butts and go buy some Christmas lights.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 First, Taylor Swift blacked out her entire online presence. Then, on Monday, she returned to social media\u2014but all she shared was a mysterious video of a snake. The internet is going nuts trying to figure out what she's up to: CNN speculates the snake video could be some sort of reference to the \"Taylor Swift is a snake\" meme beloved by her haters. Of course, the most obvious possibility is that Swift is building up hype for a new music release, and one of her collaborators, Joseph Kahn, seemed to confirm that possibility by retweeting her snake video along with a smiley face, Just Jared reports. Kahn has directed music videos for Swift including \"Bad Blood\" and \"Wildest Dreams.\" Us points out that Swift's social media blackout took place exactly three years after she announced her most recent album, 1989. The gossip magazine previously reported she's been working on an album to be released in the fall. Music lyrics site Genius posted lyrics for a new song supposedly from Swift called \"Timeless,\" but the page has since been taken down. Still, that hasn't stopped multiple outlets including Marie Claire from reporting that must be the name of her upcoming single and/or album. (And this might be the website for it.) The Ringer overanalyzes the snake snippet and offers up ideas for what it could be teasing, including an upcoming \"peace summit\" with (former?) rival Katy Perry.

WSJ's Tammy Audi takes a ride with Briles Wing & Helicopter. \n \n LOS ANGELES\u2014To help anxious Angelenos survive this weekend's shutdown of a chunk of one of the nation's busiest freeways, Kim Rodgers is offering to photograph their pets\u2014at a discount. \n \n \"You've got to be crazy to try to drive anywhere,\" says Ms. Rodgers, co-owner of Bark Pet Photography, which takes pet portraits at customers' homes. \"So if you're stuck, why not have your cat or dog photographed?\" The Santa Monica company is offering 20% off on account of the planned closure of Interstate 405. The \"4-0-fido\" deal extends to all pets. \n \n For 53 hours starting Friday night, the 405 will be closed for a 10-mile stretch through the Sepulveda Pass on the western side of Los Angeles so the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, can partially demolish a bridge to create a new lane for high-occupancy vehicles. The project won't be complete until 2013. \n \n The closure of a major artery already notorious for daily gridlock is expected to produce a traffic jam of epic proportions. Locals have dubbed it \"Carmageddon\" and \"Carpocalypse.\" \n \n Officials fear it will bring Los Angeles to a standstill. The 250,000 vehicles that normally use that part of the 405 daily are expected to overwhelm smaller highways and surface streets. \n \n The ensuing snarl will effectively cut off the San Fernando Valley in the north from shoreline communities like Santa Monica and Venice. \n \n \"It will be an absolute nightmare,\" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said at a press conference last month. \"Avoid the area, or stay home. Go on vacation that weekend.\" \n \n City officials enlisted the help of celebrities to spread the word, tapping \"CHiPs\" star Erik Estrada (\"Ponch\") to film a public service announcement. \"LAPD asked me 2tweet: 405fwy btwn 10 & 101 will be closed July16-17,\" actor Ashton Kutcher told his seven million followers on Twitter. \"In xchange I would like a free pass on that stoplight tickt IT WAS YELLOW.\" \n \n Bark Pet Photography Merchants hope to recover traffic-related lost business. \n \n Amid the pre-emptive panic, a cluster of Carmageddon capitalists is emerging to combat the shutdown's impact on the local economy. \n \n Fearful that the traffic will slow business, scores of merchants\u2014from hotels and bars to florists and jewelers\u2014are offering deals to lure spenders from their homes. Those located on shutdown-friendly thoroughfares, or neighborhoods with captive residents, see an opportunity to profit. \n \n \"It's the perfect time to get a tattoo. You can say, 'I got a tattoo the weekend they closed the 405.' It'll make it more special,\" says Howard Teman, owner of T-Man Tattoo on Ventura Boulevard, which is expected to clog during the 405 closure. \n \n Mr. Teman is offering 15% off \"any piercing or tattoo.\" He's not only hoping to attract people who live in his neighborhood, but also those stuck in the anticipated traffic crawl outside his location. To lure weary drivers out of their cars, Mr. Teman says he's thinking of hiring a man dressed in a chicken suit to stand on the sidewalk. \n \n On Wednesday, JetBlue Airways Corp. announced a \"Fly Over the 405\" deal with a $4 one-way flight from Burbank to Long Beach, 40 miles away. For $150, travelers fearing Carmageddon can fly over the snarl in the same luxury helicopters that ferry celebrities like Will Smith and, most recently, England's William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, during their Los Angeles visit. \n \n \"We're trying to make something good out of this,\" says Lance Strumpf, the chief pilot of Briles Wing & Helicopter Inc. in Van Nuys. The company usually charges at least $5,000 for a minimum two-hour charter flight in an Agusta copter, which features Italian leather seats, sound-proof interiors and subtle lighting. \n \n The price gets passengers a 15-minute flight (one-way) from the Van Nuys Airport, in the San Fernando Valley, over the 405 to the Los Angeles International Airport or the Santa Monica Airport. For no extra cost, passengers \"can look at all those people stuck in traffic down below,\" Mr. Strumpf says. \n \n \"Brave the 405 closure with a four-course dinner for $40.05,\" declares the Wilshire Restaurant on Los Angeles' west side. In Santa Monica, Harvelle's bar is offering $5 for an \"Irish Car Bomb\" or a \"Cadillac Margarita.\" \n \n The shutdown has spawned Car-mageddon.com, a website that has become the regional clearinghouse for shutdown events, deals and commentary. It sells T-shirts for $20 that read \"My gridlock is bigger than yours.\" \n \n On the upside, Angelenos can thank the closure for lowering the price they pay for diamonds. \n \n Fifth Generation Readers Fine Jewelers is offering 20% off all merchandise except single diamonds over half a carat. \n \n Avo Guerboian, whose family owns the Santa Monica shop, says he has offered discounts for Rose Bowl games and holidays, but never for a road closure. To distract potential customers from the nonromantic side of combining a gift of jewelry with the freeway shutdown, Mr. Guerboian says he will encourage clients to \"Think of it not like 'Oh, the highway is closed, and I got this necklace.' But like 'Oh, you're getting 20% off, why don't you get me the matching earrings?'\" \n \n Many businesses privately are worried the deals won't be enough to pry spenders from home. \n \n \"The idea of the 405 being closed for a critical weekend in the summer is unfortunate timing for us,\" says Jeff Klocke, marketing director for Pacific Park, the amusement park on the Santa Monica Pier. About 60,000 to 80,000 people visit the pier on a summer weekend day, Mr. Klocke said, most of them from outside Santa Monica. \n \n The park is offering 53 hours of free rides to anyone with a San Fernando Valley zip code on their driver's license. It also ordered special \"traffic-cone orange\" cotton candy for the weekend\u2014free with a day pass. Hard pressed to find an orange variety, the park got a local novelty food vendor to whip up the shade on short notice, using a banana-flavored base and experimenting with color and heat. \n \n The cotton-candy color: \"Caltrans Orange.\" \n \n Write to Tamara Audi at tammy.audi@wsj.com ||||| The army of men and machines chewed through the Sepulveda Pass, casting aside in a geological blink of an eye what had taken nature millions of years to make. From above, the Santa Monica Mountains, its crest splayed apart, looked as if it was undergoing open heart surgery \"This is the toughest highway job I've ever seen,\" project manager Gordon Bawden said at the time.This weekend's closure of the 405 Freeway, also known as the San Diego Freeway, through the Sepulveda Pass as part of a $1 billion widening project is being foretold as \"Carmageddon\" \u2014 a potential cataclysm that underscores the region's servitude to an overburdened freeway system.But in fact, the corridor has been under renovation for centuries. California's original commuter, Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola, rode a horse through the area in 1769 following Native American hunting trails. Wagon roads were carved on top of footpaths.The road that prefigured the 405, four-lane Sepulveda Boulevard, opened in 1935 and was hailed in the Los Angeles Times as a \"new and wondrous highway\" over the mountains, vastly superior to the overcrowded Cahuenga Pass and Laurel Canyon.Sepulveda would become a clogged deathtrap within a few years. It's hairpin curves claimed 65 lives during the 1950s alone in often-spectacular multi-car crashes. More than 40,000 vehicles a day squeezed through a three-lane tunnel at its crest like sausage into a casing. Northbound traffic routinely backed up to Sunset Boulevard.\"It could take you more than an hour to drive Sepulveda to West L.A. It was a long haul,\" said Chuck Mathews, 77. As a young man just out of the Air Force, he took a job as a surveyor for the highway department and would work on the corridor's next incarnation.In August 1960, work began on the 405 Freeway connecting western Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley \u2014 part of a 12-mile, $20 million project, then the most expensive California highway project to date.Newspaper accounts marveled at the supersized numbers involved. Eighteen million cubic yards of earth removed! Ninety thousand cubic yards of concrete poured! Six million pounds of steel holding it together! A 30-story building could be hidden within the depths of the so-called Big Cut.\"Back then it was bang, bang, bang \u2014 get them designed and get them built as fast as you can,\" Mathews said of the heady days when new freeways were embraced as the liberator of an expanding metropolis.Dec. 21, 1962, was a day to celebrate the opening of eight lanes of freeway that flowed through the mountains with the grace of a river.Some 800 people watched Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty cut a ribbon and then fly off in a helicopter, leading a caravan of cars southbound across the Sepulveda Pass.Motorists flooded the northbound lanes above Sunset Boulevard. Traffic backed up for more than a mile, causing the route's first SigAlert.Meantime, in the southbound lanes, police pulled over Ron Tamkin for going 72 mph in a 65 mph zone \u2014 the new freeway section's first ticket.\"I was driving my newborn son, Bobby, home from the hospital,\" said Tamkin, now 72. \"I told my wife not to tell anyone. I was embarrassed. Here I was speeding with a baby in the backseat.\"The next day's Times reported the incident \u2014 and Tamkin's name. Every detail about the new freeway was news. Tamkin clipped the story and put it in Bobby's baby book.The 405 would come to play an integral role in Tamkin's life.He and his business partners profited from land deals that led to new apartment complexes in the now easily accessible western San Fernando Valley. In 1970, Tamkin and his family moved from Mar Vista to a new home in Encino. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

For non-Angelenos: This is a big deal, hence the nicknames \"Carmageddon\" and \"Carpocalypse.\" Some of the most amusing developments: Some businesses are offering discounts to woo customers tempted to stay home, the Wall Street Journal reports. A pet photog who makes house calls will give you 20% off with her \"4-0-fido\" deal. A tattoo shop on a sure-to-be-clogged thoroughfare is offering 15% off. One restaurant will serve a $40.05 four-course meal; a bar is offering $5 Irish Car Bombs and Cadillac Margaritas. JetBlue ran a \"Fly Over the 405\" special\u2014$4 one-way tickets between Burbank and Long Beach, a 40-mile, 20-minute trip. That sold out in less than four hours, the Los Angeles Times notes, but you can still snag a $150 luxury helicopter ride over the traffic snarl, the WSJ adds. Best tweet? @latimestot quotes Jay Leno: \"2 days til Carmageddon closes the 405 freeway & u wont be able to go anywhere. As opposed to when the 405 is open & u cant go anywhere.\" In truth, the Los Angeles Times notes, the 405 has been under construction for centuries, and it traces its evolution dating back to a Spanish explorer who rode through in 1769. Is there mayhem in the works? The LA Weekly seems to think so. One \"after-hours bicycle mob\" may be planning a \"4PACOLYPSE\" ride on the empty freeway, while officials are also worried about skateboarders. And one group says it's filming a \"top secret\" flash mob publicity stunt. That's not all: Watch two of the best viral videos, in the gallery.",

    "document": "Mary Altaffer/Associated Press Guards try to wake a man sleeping in Zuccotti Park on Wednesday. \n \n The newly homeless Occupy Wall Street activists on Thursday plan a citywide day of demonstrations, an event that will test both the movement's resilience following its eviction from Zuccotti Park and the city's ability to deal with the decentralized protests. \n \n Protesters plan to start early. At 7 a.m., some say they'll try to march on Wall Street and disrupt the beginning of the work day. So far, a heavy police presence and a warren of barricades have kept protesters from holding serious protests on Wall Street. Others will gather in Zuccotti Park. \n \n WSJ's Jess Firger updates from the Occupy Wall Street protests, where protesters are being arrested after clashes with police. The end of the day suggests a heightening of protesting activities, with plans to march over the Brooklyn Bridge, she reports on Markets Hub. Photo: AP. \n \n In the afternoon, they're urging people to gather at transit hubs in each of the five boroughs. They've also called for student walkouts. \n \n Then, protesters plan to take trains to Foley Square, in Lower Manhattan. While on the subway, groups will talk about economic inequality, one organizer said. \n \n At Foley Square, plans call for a large rally that is being backed by some of the city's largest unions, one of which has obtained a permit for the rally. Protesters then plan to march across the Brooklyn Bridge's pedestrian path. The events are tied to the Occupy Wall Street movement's two-month anniversary. \n \n It's not clear how disruptive demonstrators plan to be, or what kind of police response they'll face. City officials on Wednesday said they're expecting problems and police are prepared to handle them. \n \n Following the Occupy Wall Street Protests See key dates since the Occupy Wall Street protests began. View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics \n \n \"Everything that we have seen and heard suggests that we may have tens of thousands of people tomorrow protesting,\" Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson told reporters on Wednesday. \"The protesters are calling for a massive event aimed at disrupting major parts of the city.\" \n \n Paul Browne, an NYPD spokesman, declined to comment on any police department plans for policing the various protests on Thursday. \"We don't talk about police tactics in advance,\" he said. \n \n After protesters were evicted from Zuccotti Park early Tuesday morning it's not clear if the demonstrations will end or if they'll enter a new phase. WSJ's Hilke Schellmann reports from downtown Manhattan. \n \n A police officer who works in a nonpatrol position in a Manhattan precinct said he has been ordered to report to duty policing the Occupy Wall Street protest at 4 a.m. Thursday. The officer, who asked not to be identified, said he has been told to muster at Broadway and Exchange Place and to bring \"hats and bats,\" terms for riot helmets and batons. He said he didn't know exactly how many officers like him have been ordered to the detail but supposed if they're pressing him into action, \"it will be a lot.\" \n \n Mr. Browne said that in general the protest has been peaceful but that there's been \"a small group\" of troublemakers. \n \n \"Our kind of overall posture has not changed,\" Mr. Browne said. \"We'll continue to accommodate peaceful protest.\" \n \n One widely circulated video showed a man outside Zuccotti Park on Tuesday yelling that protesters were going to burn New York City to the ground and \"you're going to see what a Molotov cocktail can do to Macy's.\" At about 5 p.m. on Wednesday at Zuccotti Park, police arrested Nkrumah Tinsely, 29, of the Bronx and charged him with making terroristic threats. He was awaiting arraignment last night. \n \n With a few exceptions, most of the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations haven't had much impact on commuters or the basic functioning of New York City beyond a few relatively small areas, like Wall Street and Zuccotti Park. \n \n The park was barricaded Wednesday, with police and private security guards manning checkpoints to keep protesters from re-establishing the camp that was dismantled early Tuesday in a surprise police raid. \n \n A few demonstrators gathered inside, but most of the construction workers and office workers who used to frequent the park stayed away. Many protesters were elsewhere, too, recovering after the drama and confusion that followed their eviction from the park. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency A woman makes a sign near the park where protests had been based. \n \n Some volunteers were working to help the movement regroup. Bill Mills, a 20-year-old from New Jersey, was at the United Federation of Teachers space where Occupy Wall Street has been storing its cache of donated supplies. He fielded requests from protesters who came looking for gear such as pants, umbrellas and food. \n \n He said he thinks the sweep of Zuccotti Park will make the protests stronger by stripping away the people who came only for fun and free food, not activism. \n \n \" Michael Bloomberg is my hero,\" Mr. Mills said. \"He catapulted us out of all this lethargy. He threw out all the drunks, all the hypocrites, all the liars, all the people who were here for a little bit of fun, and brought us down to the people who are smart enough to get things done and really have something invested in this.\" \n \n \u2014Alison Fox, Sean Gardiner \n \n and Sophia Hollander contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Andrew Grossman at andrew.grossman@wsj.com ||||| occupy wall street Thousands Assemble for Occupy Wall Street Day of Action [Updated] \n \n Update, 10:19 p.m.: The Daily News estimates that several thousand people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge. The bridge protest was largely peaceful and the marchers have now returned to Zuccotti Park. Some technologically adept Occupiers have been projecting a series of messages onto the giant Verizon building on the east side of Manhattan: \"You are a part ... of a global uprising ... from the heart ... another world is possible ... we are winning. Check out the video here. Update, 6:30 p.m.: The Times reports that 60 protesters have already been arrested at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, where they sat in the road and chanted, \"All day, all week, Occupy Wall Street.\" Among the arrested demonstrators was City Councilman Jumaane Williams. The police are going to need some more arrest buses. \n \n Update, 6:20 p.m.: Thousands of protesters have gathered in and around Foley Square, and next on the agenda is a giant march to the Brooklyn Bridge, which will cap off today's action-packed two-month anniversary of the protest's beginning. Way back at the start of October, remember, protesters marched on the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in hundreds of arrests. Today they've made damn sure the NYPD knows they're coming. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FFA18IvFyE \n \n Update, 4:33 p.m.: In an afternoon press conference, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said 177 people connected with the protests have been arrested so far today. The NYPD reports that the overtime tab for the city's cops is currently at $8 million. \n \n \"Unfortunately, some protesters today have deliberately pursued violence,\" said Mayor Bloomberg. \"Even in the face of this antagonism, the police maintained incredible restraint.\" In a dig at the day's action, he added, \"The real story for tomorrow morning's paper was there were just not that many people out here.\" \n \n Protesters are currently demonstrating at subway stations around the city and marching around Union Square, where the crowds look pretty strong, at least from the Internet. Plans call for the protest to move next to Foley Square, a few blocks from City Hall. \n \n Update, 2:13 p.m.: The clash appears to have subsided again, as people are being allowed to exit and enter the park. The Daily News reports that an injured cop may have been the reason for the rush, and quotes an officer as saying, \"There is an injured officer with a laceration to his hand. He is in stable condition. The protester had a glass object in his left hand. It's going to require stitches. The man who assaulted the officer is not in custody.\" The Times is now reporting that the protester with the glass has been apprehended. \n \n Eyewitnesses, meanwhile, are describing a protester who was kicking a barricade and caused a scuffle as police tried to detain him. \n \n Update, 1:53 p.m.: The NYPD is reportedly raiding Zuccotti Park again, entering with batons drawn and not allowing anyone to enter or exit the park. The scene is somewhat chaotic as journalists on the outside attempt to figure out what's going on inside. Mass arrests appear imminent as paddy wagons have pulled up and cops in riot gear surround the perimeter. The live-streaming of video persists. The videographer reports that a protester requesting to exit the barricades asked if he was stuck inside and an officer responded, \"Yup.\" Protesters can be heard chanting, \"We are the 99 percent,\" and \"Leave our park.\" \n \n The Daily News reports that a police officer was hit in the head with a bottle, and a protester bleeding from the head was also seen being escorted out of the park by police. Sound cannons have also been deployed against protesters. \n \n Update, 12:58 p.m.: After a frenzied attempt by marchers to break down heightened security at Zuccotti Park, barricades were placed back around the area by 12:30 p.m. as the struggle between police and protesters subsided. Police say there were at least 75 arrests in the morning. During the return to the park from the morning's Stock Exchange march, the Times reports, \"Officers could be seen shoving and hitting protesters and journalists.\" \n \n Update, 12:00 p.m.: Groups of demonstrators are now headed out of Zuccotti and towards the Brooklyn Bridge and City Hall, where there are plenty of police set up and waiting. Another group headed up Cedar Street, where police in riot gear mobilized. \n \n Update, 11:11 a.m.: The New York Times reports that protestors, amid chants of \"our park\", are trying to remove and jump the police barricades at Zuccotti. Police have moved in, and there have been several arrests. \n \n Update, 10:30 a.m: A group of protestors is headed back to Zuccotti; another is ensconced on Wall Street. Police say about 60 protestors have been arrested this a.m. There was a scuffle on William Street, as demonstrators took over the street, but it's now been cleared. Meanwhile, there were several arrests outside Trinity Church; one woman there spilled her tea while she was being arrested, then grabbed the container and threw the liquid on two cops. The church is also playing host to several topless women, who say they're protesting the treatment of women at Zuccotti Park. \n \n Update, 9:40 a.m: The Stock Exchange's opening bell rang on time at 9:30 a.m. Protestors responded by ringing a \"people's bell\" outside, where Wall Street workers struggled to press through the crowds to the office. \n \n \n \n Update, 9:21 a.m.: Nassau and Pine has been reopened to traffic, after arrested protestors were bussed away. There have also been arrests on Beaver Street, near New. And one arrestee this morning was a retired police captain named Ray Lewis, whom the crowd cheered as he was taken away. There's also a mini counter-protest, begun by people saying they want to get through to their offices \u2014 a group of men holding signs reading Get a Job and Occupy an Office. Elsewhere, an observer caught what looks like a Wall Streeter throwing a punch at a demonstrator. \n \n Update, 9:05 a.m: Here's the scene from Pine and Nassau, where the morning's first arrests took place. A group of perhaps 30 protestors sat down, to stake out their territory. Police told them they could be arrested for marching without a permit, and soon began to drag away the seated occupiers, batons unsheathed. \n \n Update, 8:24 a.m.: The march, which has swelled dramatically in size already, remains fairly peaceful: Lots of chanting, an ever-growing police presence, but no drama quite yet. Protesters have approached barricades at at least a couple sites, including Pine and Nassau and Wall and Hanover, but they've largely, it seems, either stopped to wait, or turned to continue marching. There's also been a sighting of Hipster Cop, who was apparently greeted with cheers \u2014 perhaps a sign that no one's in a truly combative mood yet today. ||||| Police officers clash with protesters affiliated with Occupy Wall Street in Zuccotti Park on November 17, 2011 in New York City.

Ten were injured in the process, including one with a head wound. \n \n \"Some people were intent on being arrested. There's no question about that. It's part of the tactic and strategy,\" said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who added that he was \"pleased\" with the performance of his officers. \n \n Seven police officers were injured during the mass protests, including five cops who had a liquid, possibly vinegar, tossed in their faces, Mayor Bloomberg said during a press conference at Bellevue Hospital, where one of the injured cops were being treated. \n \n Two officers were struck by objects thrown by protesters, including one, Matthew Walters, 24, who received 20 stitches in his left hand when he tried to deflect a star-shaped glass object that had been thrown at him. \n \n Another cop was treated and released for a hand injury. All of the officers were hospitalized but none was seriously hurt. \n \n \"We will ensure that everyone has a right to execute their First Amendment Rights,\" said the mayor, adding that most protesters \"have acted responsibly.\" \"But make no mistake about it, if anyone's actions cross the line, and jeopardize the health and safety of the first responders, we will act accordingly.\" \n \n Cops also confiscated a dozen metal devices that could have been used by protesters to lock themselves to objects, but none were used. \n \n Just before 2 p.m., police closed the exits to Zuccotti Park, which was jammed with protesters, sparking a fight for control of the barricades surrounding the plaza \u2014 the movement's lower Manhattan base until the space was cleared Tuesday morning in a pre-dawn raid. \n \n Shortly before that, 30 or 40 cops surged into the park, but protesters surrounded the officers and started yelling. Police then pushed some protesters to the ground and hit others with batons. \n \n About 50 cops then stormed into the park, moving demonstrators from one side to the other while protesters pushed back. Cops stood in a circle in the center of the park while the group chanted, \"This is a non-violent protest.\" \n \n In the melee, a man was seen laying on the ground bleeding from the head. Police said that the man, Brandon Watts, 20, tossed batteries and pieces of a plastic pen at police officers. He also allegedly stole a deputy inspector's hat. \n \n Watts then tried to shove metal barricades at the officers, who tackled him to the ground as he kicked at them, police said. The suspect, who hit his head on the ground, was treated and Bellevue Hospital and released. He was charged with attempted assault, resisting arrest and grand larceny, police said. \n \n The scuffle came just hours before a series of other actions including small protests on the subway in the afternoon and students rallying in Union Square and at Hunter College and a planned march on the Brooklyn Bridge, where more than 700 protesters were arrested in October. \n \n In Foley Square, ahead of the march to the bridge, thousands of protesters were joined by members of the Service Employees International Union and some 200 Verizon workers chanting \"we are the 99 percent\" and \"this is what a police state looks like.\" Also among the throng were rappers Fab 5 Freddy and KRS ONE. \n \n As the group streamed through Lower Manhattan, funneled by police barricade, several protesters who had already gathered at the foot of the bridge were arrested, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, according to his Twitter account. According to a witness, about 100 demonstrators wearing white shirts sat down and linked arms before being taken into custody. \n \n As protesters marched across the bridge chanting \"Whose bridge? Our bridge?\" cars honked their horns in support. Cheers erupted as a giant \"99%\" symbol was projected onto the Verizon building, near the base of the bridge. \n \n Earlier in the day, protesters said they thought their actions had delayed the stock exchange's opening bell, but an NYSE spokesman said trading started on time at 9:30 a.m. \"For us, it's business as usual,\" said NYSE spokesman Ray Pellechia. \n \n But at Zuccotti Park demonstrators rang cow bells and climbed trees to celebrate their attempt to shut down the global trading hub. \n \n \"I think it was a success,\" said 26-year-old Karen Jenson, a Wyoming resident who's been participating in the Occupy Wall Street protests for the past five weeks. \"I was not overwhelmed with our success, but I felt like we were humble about it.\" \n \n Outside the stock exchange, some of the thousands of protesters that amassed formed a human chain to block workers from heading toward the financial center, sparking a clash with police. During the scuffle cops were seen repeatedly hitting a protester with a nightstick near Broad and Beaver streets. \n \n A protester in a wheelchair joyfully recounted how cops arrested her near William Street as demonstrators linked arms and refused police orders to disperse. \n \n \"They asked me if I really wanted to be arrested,\" said 63-year-old Nadina LaStina, who uses a wheelchair because of a childhood bout with polio. \"I said, that's why I'm here, so they arrested me.\" \n \n But police weren't able to load LaStina and her wheelchair into a paddy wagon to central booking with other arrested protesters. Instead took her mugshot in the street and handed her a summons for disorderly conduct on the spot. \n \n \"It was extremely important to me as a disabled person,\" said LaStina of her arrest. \"I am very angry. I want our democracy back.\" \n \n Many angry commuters were caught up in the fracas as they tried to make their way to work. \n \n \"These a--holes need to get a job and stop keeping us from ours,\" said Jenn Bobics, 42, who works at an investment firm. \"I can't get to work now, or at least I don't know how to.\" \n \n A 23-year-old security guard on her way to work from Queens called the protest \"ridiculous.\" \n \n \"I have to get to work,\" said Shareema Williams. \n \n Police had barricaded Wall Street at Broadway only allowing those with employee IDs to pass. They also closed Hanover and Pine streets, as well as Thames Street from Nassau Street to Broadway, and Nassau Street from just south of Cedar to Wall Street. \n \n Cops in riot gear tried to keep protesters on the sidewalk, but their swelling numbers caused many of them to spill into the street. At least eight police officers were stationed in front of Wall Street's famous bronze bull sculpture. \n \n Marchers heckled Wall Street workers as they showed up for work, shouting, \"Get your corporate ID out, this is a police state\" and \"God Bless America.\" \n \n Tylee Robinson, a 23-year-old actor, tried to sneak past a police barricade wearing a suit and tie and carrying a fake corporate ID. \"I'm prepared to get arrested, I'm prepared to get beaten,\" he said. \n \n But he drew the line at being the first to jump barricades. \"I would follow someone else jumping over the barricade, but I wouldn't lead it,\" he said. \n \n Some protesters said it was Tuesday's police raid at Zuccotti Park that inspired them to join the day's events. \n \n Among them was Alison Bell, a 54-year-old lawyer from Stowe, Vt., who was with her 20-year-old son, Cameron, in Zuccotti Park. \n \n \"I participated in these sorts of things at [my son's] age. It makes me hopeful for the first time in a long time,\" Bell said. \n \n \"We want a big show of support from people who haven't been here before like me, and people who've been here from the beginning.\"",

While the film is based on his original script, Botkin claims it was \"heavily rewritten by 13 other writers,\" 12 of which went uncredited. \n \n Botkin says he did not participate in the rewrites and \"didn't get to see the film until it was in its final stage of completion, and had zero say in creative choices the second I signed away the rights to my work.\" \n \n \"I absolutely condemn any suggestion or act of non-consensual touching in any form, as well as disassociation as a coping mechanism for abuse of any kind,\" he said in a statement. \"I understand and empathize with the parents' and groups' concerns regarding the message the movie may impart.\" \n \n NCOSE, an anti-pornography organization, has asked Global Road Entertainment to halt distribution of the film and recut it \"so that it no longer contains such unsafe themes,\" it said in its statement.",

    "document": "Russell Armstrong was found dead, apparently by suicide in California. Did his participation in 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' contribute to his death? \n \n Successful venture capitalist Russell Armstrong was found dead in his Los Angeles home Monday night, apparently by his own hand. \n \n No official cause of death has yet been declared. The coroner is still conducting an investigation. \n \n But that hasn't stopped the speculation that Armstrong's involvement in a reality TV show \u2013 \u2018The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u2019 starring his estranged wife, Taylor Armstrong \u2013 may have somehow led to his death. \n \n \u201cHe was down in the dumps over the latest allegations that he had abused Taylor. I told him people don\u2019t believe everything they read and he told me, \u2018It\u2019s funny how a reality show can ruin your entire life,\u2019\u201d Armstrong\u2019s friend Tom Vickers told RadarOnline. \n \n The couple\u2019s relationship has often been rocky, and, through it all, the cameras have been rollilng. Responding to Taylor\u2019s claims that he had been an abusive husband while she was filing for divorce on July 15, Armstrong told People Magazine, \u201cDid I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit.\u201d \n \n Russell and Taylor are not the first reality TV couple whose marriage faltered on screen. Jon and Kate Gosselin, who starred together with their eight children in \u2018Jon and Kate Plus 8\u2019, ended their 10-year marriage in 2009. From then on, the show was called \u2018Kate Plus 8.' It was just canceled. \n \n Industry insiders say that \"reality\" TV is often far from an accurate presentation of events. Small slights are exaggerated, peacemaking is ignored or left on the cutting room floor in the pursuit of a dramatic narrative. So, it's not clear that what the audiences saw \u2013 or even what the \"actors\" said about the show \u2013 bears much resemblance to the truth. \n \n Still, Mark Andrejevic, University of Iowa associate professor of communications studies, has said that keeping people on the threshold of mental breakdown is a tactic that has been used on some reality television shows. In a United Press International article on Aug. 2, 2009, Prof. Andrejevic said that \u201cThe bread and butter of reality television is to get people into a state where they are tired, stressed and emotionally vulnerable.\u201d \n \n He wasn't talking about \u2018The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u2019 which only debuted in 2010. But one doesn't have to go far to find the destructive effects of living in a celebrity culture. Rabbi Schmuley Boteach, who once counseled Michael Jackson, told the Monitor last summer: \n \n \"... [the] essentials for surviving celebrity are the same as for everyone else, he says: \u201cYou need a life to keep you grounded \u2026 someone to make you take out the garbage.\u201d Next, he says is spiritual values. He points to musician Bono, who he he says has been married for 27 years and is a devout Roman Catholic, as the \u201cperfect\u201d celebrity. The Irish rocker also has a cause that is much higher than himself \u2013 Africa \u2013 and longtime friends, his band mates who will tell him when he\u2019s being stupid \u2013 the last two tools for navigating fame. \u201cIf you have these in place, as Bono does,\u201d adds Boteach, \u201cyou have a chance at a real, meaningful life.\u201d \n \n Armstrong leaves behind a daughter, Kennedy, and two sons from previous relationships. ||||| Obituary \n \n Russell Armstrong, estranged husband of Taylor Armstrong of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d was found dead last night, an apparent suicide. The couple\u2019s relationship fell apart on camera. \n \n Russell Armstrong, the 47-year-old husband of Taylor Armstrong of Bravo\u2019s hit show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, was found dead Monday night, an apparent suicide. The news was first reported by TMZ. The couple had been married for six years and had one daughter, Kennedy, age 5. Russell also had two sons from a previous marriage. \n \n A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office told The Daily Beast Tuesday afternoon that Armstrong\u2019s death does appear to be a suicide. But an autopsy will be done within two days. \n \n \n \n Armstrong had been staying with a friend in West Los Angeles on Mulholland Drive. According to a detective from the Los Angeles Police Department speaking with The Daily Beast, the friend discovered Armstrong hanged in his bedroom. Paramedics found him dead at the scene, a police spokesman said. \n \n \n \n Taylor Armstrong, 40, had filed for divorce in July, citing irreconcilable differences. But in an interview with People magazine around the same time, she said that her husband had physically abused her. Russell Armstrong told People: \u201cDid I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit.\u201d \n \n The divorce petition filed by Taylor Armstrong on July 15 in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court makes no mention of abuse or domestic violence. \n \n \n \n On the show\u2019s first season, Russell had been seen as a grumpy-at-best partner, with Taylor often lamenting the sadness in their marriage to other cast members. \u201cMy marriage is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d she said to the cameras. \u201cI just feel that something has to change.\u201d \n \n In January, Russell Armstrong talked to The Daily Beast for a story about the husbands of Real Housewives, \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what we were getting into.\u201d He said that times when he was shown leaving parties, disappointing his wife, were in fact late at night. \n \n He agreed that his decision to stay in the background of the show \u201cbackfired.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to be more engaging next season,\u201d Armstrong said. In person, he appeared more at ease than he had on camera and seemed eager to show reporters speaking with him at a party that he was kinder than audiences had seen him being. \n \n During the same interview with The Daily Beast, he cited financial pressures and working all the time as things that added to his stress. Armstrong had filed for bankruptcy in 2005, and recent reports indicated that he was again in financial trouble. \n \n In a reunion special for the show, broadcast in early February, Armstrong responded to questions about what it was like watching his marital troubles on television. \u201cIt was difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last three years have been very challenging for the entire country. I, candidly, have been working 80-hour weeks. It\u2019s very easy to get preoccupied with kids and business and the day-to-day grind.\u201d \n \n The show\u2019s first season ended with Russell and Taylor Armstrong trying to reconcile. \u201cWe definitely agreed that we wanted to keep our family together,\u201d she said during the reunion, which had been filmed in early January. On the Beverly Hills reunion, Taylor\u2019s cast mate Lisa Vanderpump said of Russell, \u201cI have been quite honest that I don\u2019t connect to him on any level at all. He seems quite cut off. And I think that must be very difficult to be married to.\u201d \n \n On Tuesday, Russell Armstrong\u2019s attorney Ronald Richards said the marriage suffered damage at the hands of the TV production. Richards represented him in the divorce and in a $1.5-million lawsuit filed against the couple last month alleging they had bilked people in an Internet medical scam. \u201cPeople start making financial decisions based upon what\u2019s best for the TV show instead of what\u2019s best for them,\u201d Richards told The Daily Beast. \u201cSo it creates a horrible cycle of bad decisions that start to pile upon one another. At this point, they were set on getting divorced.\u201d Richards recalled Russell Armstrong as \u201ca very nice guy who was very compassionate about the support of Taylor\u2019s career. He was instrumental in getting her a lot of the brand licensing deals that she\u2019s currently dealing with.\u201d Richards talked to Russell Armstrong regularly and said that when he spoke to him two days ago he seemed depressed about his divorce and the pending lawsuit, but not at a level that worried Richards. \u201cHe had the normal depression that you would expect based on being in a lawsuit and a divorce but nothing beyond the ordinary,\u201d Richards said. \u201cI was not concerned. This is very tough on all levels. He had a very good relationship with all of his kids.\u201d \n \n After the news of Armstrong\u2019s death broke on Tuesday, Andy Cohen, Bravo\u2019s executive vice president of original programming and development, who also hosts the channel\u2019s talk show Watch What Happens: Live, tweeted, \u201cI am so very sad about today\u2019s news. My prayers and thoughts are with Taylor Armstrong and her family.\u201d The network issued a similar statement. \n \n Through her manager, Robert Thorne, Taylor Armstrong issued this statement: \u201cTaylor Armstrong is devastated by the tragic events that have unfolded. She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter. Her thoughts and prayers are also with Russell\u2019s 11- and 13-year-old sons.\u201d \n \n \n \n Bravo launched the successful Real Housewives franchise in 2006 with The Real Housewives of Orange County. In subsequent years, the show expanded to New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Miami, and Beverly Hills. Before cameras, women in the casts have experienced divorce, problems with their children, foreclosure, and bankruptcy. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

The death that garnered the most attention was the sudden passing of Capt. Phil Harris on Discovery\u2019s Deadliest Catch in 2010, who appeared to be recovering from a stroke he suffered while filming. Harris asked for production to continue, which allowed the cameras to capture his unexpected death and earned the series an Emmy nomination. \n \n \u201cWhat happened on Housewives is a tragedy,\u201d Beers said Tuesday. \u201cThe challenge is that when it happens, the shows are already in the can. It casts a pall over the whole production because the shows start airing, and there\u2019s nothing you can do. This thing has happened that you\u2019re not addressing because the show was in the can already, and it just becomes very weird. It really affects the spirit of the entire production.\u201d \n \n Season 2 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills was scheduled to premiere on Sept. 5. In a trailer for the upcoming episodes, Taylor Armstrong appears several times, at one point tearfully saying to cast mate Adrienne Maloof, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m breaking.\u201d Maloof responds: \u201cYou are. You\u2019re having a nervous breakdown.\u201d \n \n The Daily Beast emailed Bravo for a response to Russell Armstrong\u2019s attorney\u2019s accusation that being on the show created undue financial pressure on the couple, and to ask whether the season premiere will air as planned, how much the dissolution of the Armstrong marriage would be featured during the season, and whether the show would be changed or reedited at all because of the news. A network spokesperson said no decisions have been made as of yet. ||||| Unscripted \n \n Two weeks before the season-two premiere of 'Beverly Hills,\u2019 Taylor Armstrong\u2019s estranged husband, Russell, is dead in a suicide. Kate Aurthur and Maria Elena Fernandez on the couple\u2019s money woes and on-camera unraveling\u2014and Bravo\u2019s plans for the show. \n \n Update: On Wednesday afternoon, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner's office confirmed the police department's early findings that Armstrong hanged himself. Toxicology results are pending, the spokesman said. \n \n \n \n The women of Bravo\u2019s phenomenally successful Real Housewives reality TV franchise have experienced\u2014on camera\u2014divorce, problems with their children, foreclosure, and bankruptcy. Off camera there have been three deaths as well: the fianc\u00e9 of Gretchen Rossi and the ex-husband of Tammy Knickerbocker, both of Orange County, died of natural causes; and the ex-fianc\u00e9 of Atlanta\u2019s Kandi Burruss was beaten to death in a fight at a club. \n \n And now there has been an apparent suicide. Russell Armstrong, the 47-year-old husband of Taylor Armstrong, 40, of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, was found dead Monday night, two weeks before the premiere of the show\u2019s second season. He had been staying in West Los Angeles on Mulholland Drive with a friend, who discovered Armstrong hanged in his bedroom, according to a detective from the Los Angeles Police Department who spoke with The Daily Beast. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene, a police spokesman said. A representative from the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office said Armstrong\u2019s death does appear to be a suicide but that an autopsy will be conducted within two days. The news was first reported by TMZ. \n \n During the first season of Beverly Hills, Russell was portrayed as a grumpy-at-best partner, leaving parties in a sulk, buying his daughter a dog she was allergic to without seeming to care, and coming across as cold and uncomfortable. Taylor often talked about the sadness in her marriage to other cast members. \u201cMy marriage is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d she told the cameras. \u201cI just feel that something has to change.\u201d The season ended with the couple trying to work out their problems. \u201cWe definitely agreed that we wanted to keep our family together,\u201d Taylor said during a reunion of the cast, filmed in early January. The couple had been married for six years and had a 5-year-old daughter, Kennedy. \n \n But the reconciliation did not last. Taylor filed for divorce on July 15, citing irreconcilable differences. In an interview with People magazine around the same time, she said that her husband had physically abused her. Russell told People: \u201cDid I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. This show has literally pushed us to the limit.\u201d (The divorce petition filed in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court, viewed by The Daily Beast on Tuesday, makes no mention of abuse or domestic violence.) \n \n Season two of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2014part of a franchise that has expanded since the 2006 launch of Orange County to New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Miami\u2014is scheduled to premiere on Sept. 5. Asked whether the show will air as planned, how much the dissolution of the Armstrong marriage will be featured during the season, and whether the show will be changed or reedited in the wake of Russell\u2019s death, a network spokesperson said no decisions have been made. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the channel\u2019s executives plan to wait \u201cat least 24 hours to make a decision about whether they\u2019ll postpone the show.\u201d \n \n Russell does not appear in the premiere, which has already been sent out to the press. \u201cHe was not happy about how he thought the show would portray him,\u201d Russell Armstrong\u2019s attorney, Ronald Richards, reached on Tuesday, told The Daily Beast. But the couple\u2019s marital problems are front and center, plot-wise. In her first scene, Taylor goes shopping for lingerie with friends in order to \u201cspice up my love life\u201d with Russell. She says they are in couple's therapy. \n \n The therapy comes up again later in the episode under more fraught circumstances. At a dinner party with the whole cast and their spouses\u2014except for Russell\u2014Taylor feels that Ken Todd, the husband of Lisa Vanderpump, is judging her for needing professional help to save her marriage. She breaks down in tears and leaves the table. \n \n When she returns, the confrontation continues. \u201cWe were at the end of our rope,\u201d she tells Todd. \u201cI\u2019m really fragile right now. I\u2019m going through so much\u2014it\u2019s a lot.\u201d \n \n In confessional interviews to the camera, fan favorites Ken and Lisa do not appear to be sympathetic to Taylor. Ken says, \u201cIt seems to me that Taylor can turn on the waterworks whenever she wants to.\u201d \n \n \u201cTaylor\u2019s very manipulative,\u201d Lisa says. She later adds, \u201cHer mood goes up and down like the whore\u2019s drawers.\u201d \n \n In a trailer for the upcoming season, Taylor appears to be crying several times, at one point tearfully saying to cast mate Adrienne Maloof, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m breaking.\u201d Adrienne responds: \u201cYou are. You\u2019re having a nervous breakdown.\u201d \n \n Reality television has faced dilemmas over whether to air tragedies before. In 1994, MTV\u2019s third season of The Real World cast the HIV-positive Pedro Zamora, and his death that same year was memorialized in a special tribute program. At the opposite end of the spectrum, when in 2009 Ryan Jenkins, a contestant on VH1\u2019s dating show Megan Wants a Millionaire, murdered his wife and then committed suicide rather than be arrested, the network pulled the show off the air and scrapped it. \n \n Thom Beers, executive producer of several testosterone-fueled documentary-style programs that follow men whose livelihoods force them to confront death on a regular basis, has dealt with the passing of three cast members. The sudden death, on camera, of Capt. Phil Harris of Discovery\u2019s Deadliest Catch in 2010 garnered the most attention.

It takes many forms: private planes, posh mansions, thousand-dollar shopping sprees. And it seemed Russell Armstrong and his wife, Taylor, who appeared on \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" had been living up to the lifestyle. Last season, Taylor threw a $60,000 party for their then-4-year-old daughter, frequently conferred with a private stylist and devoted much of her free time to philanthropy.On Monday night, Russell Armstrong, 47, was found dead in an apparent suicide, and facts began to emerge Tuesday that raise questions about how the program presented the couple and whether the resulting glare of publicity played any role in his death.For one, it appears the Armstrongs were far less wealthy than viewers might have surmised. Russell Armstrong, who described himself as a venture capitalist, was a struggling entrepreneur who racked up $12 million in debts in the tech bust and was recently sued with his wife for allegedly diverting investors' money to redecorate a Bel-Air mansion and hobnob with the truly wealthy.\" 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,' I think, was [Russell's] downfall. The TV show put a lot of pressure on him to produce financially. You're on a show with a couple like the Maloofs, who are verifiable billionaires, and you're not,\" said friend William Ratner, referring to \"Housewives\" personality Adrienne Maloof, whose family owns the Sacramento Kings and their home arena as well as Las Vegas' Palms casino resort.In July, Taylor Armstrong, 40, filed for divorce from her husband (the difficulties in the couple's marriage were evident in the show's first season). As a result, he had been staying with a friend at his home on the 1400 block of Mulholland Drive. On Monday night, the friend discovered Russell Armstrong's body: He had hanged himself and left no suicide note behind, according to authorities.A statement released by Taylor Armstrong's publicist said she was \"devastated by the tragic events that have unfolded. She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter.\"The second season of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" is scheduled to premiere Sept. 5, according to Bravo, the cable network that airs the program. At press time, a Bravo representative said a decision had not yet been made on whether the season will be postponed or episodes re-edited.The \"Real Housewives\" franchise, which launched in 2006 and followed five women living in Orange County, has become one of Bravo's most lucrative brands, expanding into multiple locations including New Jersey, New York City and Atlanta. Much of its appeal centers on its protagonists' opulent lifestyles and the over-the-top drama surrounding them. Though many of the women on the shows boast about their rich and seemingly picture-perfect lives, in the tabloids, another reality has often been revealed: At least half a dozen \"Housewives\" have begun divorce proceedings and roughly the same number have filed for bankruptcy since signing on to the show.The first season of the \"Beverly Hills\" edition came to a close in January, when its finale episode drew an impressive 2.76 million viewers. In the series, Russell was portrayed as the strait-laced husband \u2014 he left parties early and his wife complained he was unaffectionate, which seemed to be at the core of the couple's struggles. Taylor, at one point, referred to their marriage as a \"business partnership.\"Much of the second season was supposed to document her struggle to keep the marriage intact. In the upcoming season premiere, which already has been made available to the television media, Taylor is shown buying lingerie in an attempt to spice up their love life and discussing their attempt at couples therapy; Russell is the only husband not shown in the episode.Ratner, a Los Angeles restaurant investor, said he last saw Armstrong in June and that his friend already knew a divorce was coming.\"I went in and talked with him, and he said, 'I don't know why she's doing this. Why can't she do this off the show?' He said there were still two weeks left of shooting and he didn't want to be in it,\" Ratner explained. \"He said the producers at Bravo told Russell and Taylor that they picked them as the 'disaster couple,' and if they weren't going to have drama in the second season, they would cut them and replace them with someone else.\"Asked to respond to Ratner's assertions, a Bravo representative said \"Production has assured us that there is no truth to these claims.\" A network statement expressed sympathy for the Armstrong family \"at this difficult time.\"But Ronald Richards, the attorney who is representing Russell Armstrong in the divorce and in previous litigation, agreed that his client's behavior changed once he became a part of a show \u2014 something he did in an effort to help build his wife's \"brand.\"\"He helped build the brand and the show, and it's unfortunate how things worked out because right when her brand became valuable and he thought he could get endorsements for different products, this happened,\" he said. \"When you join these shows, you end up trying to support an imaginary lifestyle that's on the show. He was forced to do that because a character loses their brand value if they don't and diverts the segment on to other characters.\"In a July interview with People magazine , Taylor Armstrong said that Russell was verbally and physically abusive, sometimes \"grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.\" (None of these allegations was included in her divorce filing.)\"Did I push her? Yes, maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were,\" Russell Armstrong responded in the article. \"This show has literally pushed us to the limit.\"However, in March 1998, Russell Armstrong pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery involving his first wife. He was sentenced to three days in county jail, 50 hours community service and 36 months summary probation. ||||| By Radar Staff \n \n Russell Armstrong broke down just days before he committed suicide and admitted to a friend that reality TV had destroyed his life. \n \n In an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com Tom Vickers reveals how in his final days Russell was \u2018somber\u2019 and \u2018withdrawn\u2019 and blamed Real Housewives for turning his life upside down. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s terrible news,\u201d said the photographer, who forged a friendship with Russell over recent months and last spoke to him on August 4. \u201cBut during our phone call he didn\u2019t sound like the Russell that I knew. \n \n PHOTOS: Russell Armstrong and Taylor Armstrong In Happier Times \n \n \u201cHe was down in the dumps over the latest allegations that he had abused Taylor.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 After Russell Armstrong's suicide, one question is apparently on everyone's mind: Is Real Housewives to blame? The Los Angeles Times, Christian Science Monitor, and two separate Daily Beast stories all delve into that question, noting that Armstrong's marriage troubles were splashed all over television during the first season of the franchise's Beverly Hills version. Sources say the show pressured the Armstrongs to live beyond their means\u2014they were actually millions in debt and being sued by investors\u2014and also pressured them to ramp up the drama in their relationship. Radar reports that Armstrong told a friend, days before his death, that reality TV had ruined his \"entire life.\" But Armstrong's ex-wife blames estranged wife Taylor, from whom Armstrong was getting divorced. \"She's bad news and she drove him into this,\" the ex tells Radar. \"I don't think it was the show. I think she drove him into financial stress and it just ruined him.\" Radar offers up another possible reason: A tell-all was about to be published, and would reveal that he was bisexual and may have had affairs with men.
