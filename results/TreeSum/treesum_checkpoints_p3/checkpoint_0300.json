According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. \n \n Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. \n \n \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. \n \n Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. \n \n Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers\u2019 discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. \n \n Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA\u2019s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. \n \n \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking. \n \n Source: Crotty Alexander L, Matthew D, Hwang J, et al. Analysis of the Effects of Cigarette Smoke on Staphylococcal Virulence Phenotypes. Infection and Immunity. 2015. ||||| Cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses, according to a new study led by UC San Diego scientists. \n \n In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill, said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. \n \n Crotty Alexander is senior author of the paper, published Monday in the journal Infection and Immunity. \n \n The study is similar to one published last May, in which the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance was examined. \n \n Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. \u2014 Hayne Palmour IV Share Photo \uf610 \n \n \uf611 \n \n Reddit \n \n \u2709 Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. \u2014 Hayne Palmour IV \n \n Cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, Crotty Alexander said. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. \n \n MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, the study stated. \n \n In addition, Crotty's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. \n \n Worse, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions. At that rate, a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. \n \n \"When we put these cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality,\" compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed, Crotty Alexander said in a phone interview Thursday. \n \n The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. \n \n \"The cigarette smoke helped the bacteria kill more mice, whereas the e-cigarette vapor was just on the borderline,\" Crotty Alexander said. \"It did make it a little more aggressive, but not as much as the cigarette smoke.\" \n \n Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. \u2014 NIAID Share Photo \uf610 \n \n \uf611 \n \n Reddit \n \n \u2709 Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. / NIAID \n \n The study stated it was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative. \n \n \"Because MRSA causes severe pneumonia more often than MSSA, and because MRSA commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and airways and thus is exposed to inhaled substances, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke on MRSA resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice,\" the study stated. \n \n Tests on human cells found the same result, Crotty Alexander said. Previous research has shown that cigarette smoke harms human respiratory and immune cells, she said. \n \n So the picture now is that cigarette smoke both harms smokers and assists pathogens. \n \n Study co-authors include Elisa K.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)",

It says, 'Let his days be few, let another have his office,\u2019\u201d Perdue added. \n \n After some laughter, he went on to say, \"In all seriousness, I believe that America is at a moment of crisis.\" \n \n The next verse, which he did not recite, reads \u201cmay his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.\u201d \n \n Democrats accused Perdue of wishing for Obama\u2019s death. \n \n \u201cIf Republicans are still wondering why Donald Trump is their nominee, look no further than today\u2019s Faith and Freedom conference where a sitting Republican senator left the impression he was praying for the death of President Obama,\u201d Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada wrote in an email. \n \n In response to questions about the phrase, a spokeswoman for Perdue accused the media of \u201cpushing a narrative to create controversy.\u201d \n \n \"Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that,\u201d spokeswoman Megan Whittemore said in a statement. \n \n The passage is one of the Bible\u2019s \u201cimprecatory psalms,\u201d which as Harvard Divinity School professor Michael Coogan explained to ABC News, is \u201cone of the best examples of an extended series of calling upon God to punish or curse one\u2019s enemy.\u201d \n \n \u201cAbout half the [imprecatory] psalms are individuals praying to God for help in various situations, and often those situations is one in which the praying individual precedes that he is being persecuted, perhaps unjustly by enemies who are often described in hyperbolic terms like \u2018raging lions\u2019 or \u2018a pack of dogs\u2019 or something like that,\u201d Coogan said. \n \n When asked what he thought about the use of this psalm in a political speech, Coogan responded, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that he meant this literally. I think it was tongue in cheek.\u201d \n \n Graham A. Cole, the dean and vice president of education at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, also weighed in. \n \n \"It puzzles me that this psalm was used in this way. It is technically a psalm of lament. That is to say, that it expresses anguish over the state of affairs the psalmist is in. The senator clearly feels such anguish. \n \n \u201cHowever, the line quoted does not make much sense in the present context. President Obama will indeed be out of office soon and another will take his place. I do not think that the senator's use of the line necessarily means he wishes death for the president,\" Cole wrote in an email. \n \n This isn\u2019t the first time a public official\u2019s use of this 109th chapter of the Old Testament book has elicited some measure of controversy. \n \n A Florida sheriff\u2019s deputy was suspended without pay in 2010 when he left an open Bible with the verse highlighted on a colleague\u2019s desk with a note that said \u201cThe Obama Prayer.\u201d ||||| Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) joked at a conservative Christian event on Friday that he prays President Barack Obama\u2019s days will be \"few.\" \n \n The first-term senator began his opening statement at the Faith & Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority conference by telling attendees to pray for Obama. With a smirk, Perdue said, \u201cWe should pray like Psalms 109:8 says. It says: 'Let his days be few and let another have his office.'\u201d \n \n The large crowd laughed. \n \n Perdue did not continue reciting the words, but Psalm 109 is a death wish for one of David\u2019s enemies. \n \n It goes on: \"Let his children be fatherless; and his wife a widow. Let his children wander about and beg; and let them seek sustenance far from their ruined homes. Let the creditor seize all that he has; and let strangers plunder the product of his labor. Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him; nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off; in a following generation let their name be blotted out.\" \n \n Caroline Vanvick, a spokeswoman for Perdue, issued the following response: \n \n Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that. However, we should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of. \n \n The Christian Science Monitor noted that conservatives have used this verse in the past to talk about the end of Obama\u2019s days in office. ||||| There are a few axioms to live by in American politics, even in this degraded age: All politics is local. If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. Politics stops at the water\u2019s edge. And, uh, don\u2019t pray for the death of the sitting president of the United States. \n \n At least, that last one seemed like common sense. Yet Senator David Perdue appeared to break the rule Friday morning. In his remarks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority conference, Betsy Woodruff reported, the freshman Georgia Republican encouraged attendees to pray for President Obama. According to Perdue\u2019s office, he said: \n \n I think we\u2019re called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and yes, even our president. In his role as president I think we should pray for Barack Obama. But I think we need to be very specific about how we pray. We should pray like Psalms 109:8 says. It says, \u201cLet his days be few, and let another have his office.\u201d \n \n As many people quickly pointed out, the quotation is not exactly a benign plea for a new president in its original context. Here\u2019s a chunk of the psalm: \n \n 8. Let his days be few; and let another take his office. \n \n 9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. \n \n 10. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. \n \n 11. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. \n \n 12. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. \n \n 13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. \n \n That\u2019s pretty ugly stuff. As frightening as the imprecation is in its original Old Testament version\u2014its really masterful, bitter language\u2014it takes on an even more chilling aspect in Christian theology. In the New Testatment book of Acts, Peter quotes the psalm as foretelling the ruin of Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of Jesus. \n \n Perdue didn\u2019t make this up. In fact, this verse\u2014sometimes labeled \u201cthe Obama Prayer\u201d\u2014has been circulating for years among conservatives. Gawker\u2019s John Cook noted the prevalence of the reference on internet message boards and in CafePress t-shirts and bumperstickers back in November 2009.

A spokeswoman for Perdue, however, tells ABC the media is \"pushing a narrative to create controversy.\" \"Senator Perdue said we are called to \u2013 Sen. David Perdue joked about praying for President Obama during his opening statement at a Christian conference Friday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. \"We should pray like Psalms 109:8 says. It says: 'Let his days be few and let another have his office,'\" the Georgia Republican said, drawing laughter from the crowd. A spokeswoman for Perdue later said the senator \"in no way wishes harm towards our president\" and that he \"should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of.\" A spokesman for the First Amendment Institute, however, says Perdue's use of the line \"doesn't necessarily mean he wishes death for the president,\" the Hill reports. \u2013 Georgia Sen. David Perdue is in hot water after telling a prayer conference that the nation should pray for President Obama. \"I think we\u2019re called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and yes, even our president,\" he said, according to Betsy Woodruff of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. But \"we need to be very specific about how we pray,\" he added. \"We should pray like Psalms 109:8 says, 'Let his days be few, and let another have his office.' ... Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. ... Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children. 13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in generation following let their name blotted out. That\u2019s pretty ugly stuff.\" A Perdue spokeswoman later told the Huffington Post that the senator \"in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that. However, we should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of.\"",

    "document": "BRUSSELS Two weeks ago, the mayor of Molenbeek ordered the closure of a neighborhood bar where Brussels police had found young men dealing drugs and smoking dope over the summer. \n \n Last Friday, the owner blew himself up at another laid-back corner cafe, this time in Paris, on a mission of retribution from Islamic State. \n \n Brahim Abdeslam's journey from barkeeper to suicide bomber remains a mystery, along with the whereabouts of his younger brother Salah, now on the run as Europe's most wanted man but until recently the manager of Brahim's bar, Les Beguines. \n \n The brothers sold the business just six weeks ago. \n \n There is a seeming disconnect between the ownership by Muslims - whose religion forbids the use of alcohol and tobacco - of a bar, where drugs were being dealt, on a quiet street in the low-rent Brussels borough of Molenbeek who have become the focus of a manhunt for violent Islamists with ties to Syria. \n \n Yet time and again, investigations after attacks like those that killed 129 people in Paris have uncovered tales of workaday Arab immigrant lives, assimilated to the profane daily cares and pleasures of European cities, that have turned, unseen to family and friends, into explosions of pious, suicidal fanaticism. \n \n \"It's shocking, especially when it's people you've hung out with,\" said 25-year-old Nabil, as he walked home from work to his apartment nearby, past the cafe on rue des Beguines, now shuttered by court order, which Brahim Abdeslam, 31, had owned. \n \n \"They were regular guys, who enjoyed a laugh,\" he said, still wearing his workclothes and a Nike baseball cap. \"There was nothing radical about them. ... They were here just last week hanging out. ... I think they were indoctrinated. ... There is some mastermind behind it all.\" \n \n \"LIKE SYLVESTER STALLONE\" \n \n Hicham, also 25 and in blue tracksuit and sneakers, echoed that view of Brahim and Salah: \"They smoked. They didn't go to the mosque or anything. We saw them every day at the cafe,\" he said. Brahim, with a voice \"like Sylvester Stallone,\" could, he conceded, at times be \"a bit crazy\". \n \n \"We played cards. We talked about football,\" he added. \"We talked about the everyday. Nothing jihadist, not about Islam.\" \n \n Those sentiments were echoed by family including a third brother, a local council employee, who was released on Monday after two days in custody, and by former workmates of Salah at the tram repair shop - though the latter told public radio that the \"joker\" Salah lost that job in 2011 for absenteeism. \n \n Belgian media also reported that Salah spent time in jail for robbery five years ago alongside another Molenbeek man, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 28. French investigators believe Abaaoud may have ordered the Paris attacks from Syria, where he has become an Internet propagandist for Islamic State under the nom de guerre Abu Omar al-Belgiki - the Belgian. \n \n Belgian police could not confirm any previous record for the brothers or whether they had been under surveillance. \n \n \"STRONG SMELL OF DRUGS\" \n \n What is clear is that the bar the brothers ran had annoyed some of its neighbors and, in August, been raided by police. \n \n Details posted on the door, on the ground floor of a typical brick-built 19th-century townhouse and confirmed by police to Reuters, stated: \"The premises have been used for the consumption of banned hallucinogenic substances.\" \n \n The notice ordered a five-month closure from Nov. 5, and said police found \"a strong smell of drugs\" and ashtrays containing \"partially smoked joints\", while a number of customers were found to be carrying drugs on their persons. \n \n The notice said the manager had been given a chance, on Sept. 4, to object. \"But he did not reply to our invitation\". \n \n Molenbeek Mayor Francoise Schepmans has described Molenbeek as a \"breeding ground for radical violence\", suffering from high youth unemployment and overcrowding. Belgian ministers have promised to \"clean it up.\" \n \n The Abdeslams do not appear to have figured among the jobless. Legal documents reviewed by Reuters and first reported by Belgian newspaper L'Echo show that Brahim, a French citizen born in Brussels, formed a company in March 2013 to run the bar. \n \n In December that year, Brahim stepped aside as manager of the company in favor of Salah, but remained the main owner. Two other family members held small stakes at various times. \n \n On Sept. 30 this year, after the closure warning, the family sold out to an individual who gave an address in southern Belgium. That person could not be contacted by Reuters. \n \n The documents listed both brothers' address as the family home in a four-storey house facing Molenbeek town hall across a cobbled square. There, Mohammed Abdeslam, the brother held by police, told reporters the family were stunned by events. \n \n \"We've never had problems with the law,\" he said on the doorstep. \"My parents are in shock and can't quite take in what's happened,\" he added, saying they had had no idea Brahim was going to Paris on Friday or where Salah now was. \n \n According to French police, Brahim detonated a suicide vest at the Comptoir Voltaire, a cafe close to the Bataclan music hall where gunmen killed 89. The explosion seriously wounded several other people. \n \n Salah, police say, rented a Volkswagen car that was found near the Bataclan with Belgian plates and he was later checked, but not arrested, near the Belgian border, in a car with two others. \n \n GIVING A FRIEND A RIDE \n \n A lawyer for Mohammed, who works for the town hall, said Mohammed was released because he had an alibi putting him in the French northern border city of Lille, where he was helping renovate a bar. \n \n Lawyers say the two men in the car with Salah when he was stopped by French police early on Saturday near Cambrai are among three people in Belgian custody. The lawyer for one, Mohamed Amri, said he had taken a call from a friend saying he had broken down in Paris and drove south to fetch him. Amri said he had known nothing of any involvement in the attacks. \n \n Outside Les Beguines, just over a mile from Molenbeek town hall, another acquaintance of the Abdeslam brothers, 23-year-old Amir, who works installing shop tills, said a friend had called him on Friday night asking him to drive the 280 km (180 miles) to Paris to pick up Salah. Amir told him he could not go. \n \n He was told Salah offered to pay the fuel costs, but Amir did not want to run up such big mileage on his leased car. \"It's incredible,\" he said of the arrests of those who did drive Salah. \"It could have been me. ... I had no idea.\" \n \n With television running hours of live coverage on Monday from the armed police siege of a house in Molenbeek in the hunt for Salah, his brother Mohammed stressed that Salah had been found guilty of nothing: \"But with things as tense as they are,\" he said, \"we don't know if he'll dare give himself up.\" \n \n So what took Brahim from running a marijuana-scented beer joint named for a mediaeval order of Christian lay nuns to blowing himself up at a bar named for Voltaire, the 18th-century critic of religion? \n \n His brother Mohammed had seen \"absolutely nothing\". Brahim and Salah were, he said, \"two brothers who were totally normal\". \n \n (Additional reporting and writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Leslie Adler) ||||| A Paris suicide bomber drank, smoked and ran a drug den, friends who visited the bar he ran have said. \n \n Ibrahim Abdeslam, who blew himself up outside the Comptoir Voltaire caf\u00e9 on Friday night during a terrorist rampage, enjoyed activities banned under Islamic law. \n \n Abdeslam ran Les Beguines caf\u00e9 in Rue des Beguines, Molenbeek, a poor district of Brussels notorious for Islamist extremism, from 2013 to August this year, when it was shut by the local commune due to drugs. It is now boarded up. \n \n His brother Salah is now subject to an international manhunt, while another sibling, Mohammed, has been interviewed by police before being released. \n \n A neighbour, who declined to be named, told the Telegraph: \"Ibrahim was the proprietor, but the cafe is closed now. I used to go there every day after work, on my way home. We would go there to smoke hashish, drink alcohol, no problem. \n \n \u201cIbrahim and I played cards together, we laughed and joked. He talked to everyone, he was very generous. I would have a drink and he would say don't worry about playing. I used to play cards with Salah too, he was often at the cafe. \n \n \u201cIbrahim used to go to parties, he would drink alcohol, smoke. But he stopped drinking alcohol in the last year. \n \n \u201cNow I am scared because I talked to them, I know them. Everyone is disgusted and shocked. No one thought it was possible that it was them. \" \n \n Another man, aged 30, who lives just down the road from Les Beguines caf\u00e9 said: \u201cI used to play football with Salah, he played very well. He used to go out to a lot of parties. \n \n \"I also saw Ibrahim a lot at the cafe. They are good guys, like any other guys in this area.\" \n \n A police raid in August found the bar was \u201cused for the consumption of illegal hallucinogenic substances and had a strong smell of drugs and half smoked joints at the tables,\u201d according to the closure order posted on the front door. \n \n \u201cThe bar appears to be a point where you can buy and consume drugs, causing problems for the neighbourhood and public order in general,\u201d the order said. \n \n During the raid customers were found with drugs and five were booked by police for possession, the order said. \n \n The requirement to close came into force last week but locals said Ibrahim had sold the bar after the police raid, and made \u201ca lot of money\u201d. \n \n The Belgian newspaper L'Echo reported that Les Beguines cafe was set up by Ibrahim in March 2013, who remained the majority shareholder, according to company records. \n \n His brother Saleh, who has been dubbed 'the most wanted manin Europe', was a manager at the cafe. \n \n He chaired the most recent general meeting on September 30, documents reveal, at which he and another family member resigned from the business. \n \n Ibrahim, who seriously injured a bystander when he detonated his suicide bomb, rented a Seat Leon used in the attacks. \n \n The car was used by the terrorists who murdered diners outside the Casa Nostra pizza restaurant and the La Belle \u00c9quipe cafe. \n \n It was later found abandoned with a cache of weapons inside. \n \n The area has been described as an \u201cairbase\u201d for jihadists, and has been linked to plots including the 2004 Madrid bombing, the 2014 Jewish Museum shooting and this year\u2019s botched attack on a Thalys commuter train. \n \n Jan Jambon, the Belgian interior minister, this week vowed to \u201cclean up\u201d the area, saying that the government had lost control of it.",

Six weeks later, Brahim blew himself up outside a Paris cafe and Salah is on the run from a continent-wide manhunt. Authorities shut down Les Beguines, located in a heavily Muslim area of Brussels, on Nov. 5 after a police raid in August found patrons selling drugs and smoking marijuana, Reuters reports. And a neighbor tells the Journal the bar was \"a rough hangout with regular fights and frequent visits by police.\" Brahim and Salah were reportedly known to police for drug violations despite the use of drugs\u2014in addition to alcohol and tobacco\u2014being banned in Islam. \"The history of the two fits a pattern in which many Islamist terrorists in Europe have been radicalized from the ranks of petty criminals and drug users,\" the Journal states.

    "document": "Okay folks, we\u2019re live at Facebook\u2019s press event for\u2026 sure enough, its new mobile App Center, the one that started leaking out earlier today. The company shared most of the details about how the store will work during a May press announcement, but to review: it\u2019ll be one central store for finding any app across web, iOS, Android, mobile web, etc. You\u2019ll get app suggestions based on ratings and what your friends play, similar to previous recommendation features that Facebook has provided over the years. And, paid apps are also part of the deal. \n \n We\u2019re following up with further details, but for now, here\u2019s the official announcement. \n \n The App Center is launching tonight with more than 600 social apps, including Nike+ GPS, Ubisoft Ghost Recon Commander, Stitcher Radio, Draw Something, and Pinterest. \n \n Each person will have a personalized experience in the App Center, with recommendations based on the apps they and their friends use, whether that be games or fashion, food, fitness, travel, or other lifestyle apps. \n \n You\u2019ll only see high quality apps in the App Center, based on user ratings and engagement. \n \n The App Center is available on mobile via the Facebook apps for iOS and Android, or by accessing Facebook.com on mobile. \n \n Stats: ||||| Facebook has launched an app store, similar to that for the Apple iPhone, in a bid to turn the social network into a key entertainment platform online. \n \n The network announced its \"App Centre\" in a blogpost late on Thursday, confirming its first major move into a booming market of gaming, lifestyle and productivity applications. \n \n The app store will be available only to US users from Friday, opening to each of Facebook's 901 million users in the coming weeks. It will feature 600 apps, including the popular Draw Something and Pinterest, and new games such as Jetpack Joyride and Ghosts of Mistwood. \n \n \"The App Centre gives you personalised recommendations, and lets you browse the apps your friends use,\" said Facebook's Matt Wyndowe in the blogpost. \n \n \"It only lists high-quality apps, based on feedback from people who use the app.\" \n \n The move is designed to keep Facebook users on the social network for longer, giving them less reason to leave the site for a rival platform. \n \n However, the focus on mobile apps is likely to attract criticism from those who see them as harmful to the future of the open web. Facebook has already faced criticism from internet rivals such as Google for its so-called \"walled garden\" approach to what can and cannot be released on its platform. \n \n The app store will be available on Facebook's iOS and Android apps, as well as on the main website. Users can send an app on the website to be downloaded onto their mobile device. \n \n Apps have quickly become a part of daily life for smartphone owners across the globe. Ushered in by Apple's iPhone and, later, by Google's Android and other mobile operating systems, an estimated 31bn apps were downloaded to mobile devices last year, according to industry analyst Juniper Research. \n \n Although most apps are free to download, the still-nascent medium is delivering significant revenues for hugely popular games such as Angry Birds. Juniper Research predicts that by 2016 mobile apps will generate $52bn of revenues \u2013 75% from smartphones and 25% from tablets. ||||| The social network just unveiled its App Center, and it's accessible on iOS and Android devices, as well as through the Web on Facebook.com. Here's what you can expect to see. \n \n (Credit: Facebook) \n \n Facebook's App Center has arrived, and it's got more than 600 apps in tow, including big hitters like Pinterest, Draw Something, Nike+, Path, and Ghost Recon. Let's take a look at how it all works. \n \n The first thing you should know is that App Center is not a Facebook marketplace akin to Google Play or Apple's App Store. Rather, it's a hub for discovering new and interesting apps based on your Facebook activity and your friends' activity. In fact, whenever App Center recommends a mobile app, it actually links out to Google Play and iTunes so you can easily download it. \n \n On the Web, you can access the App Center through a bookmark on the top left of your news feed page. Once you're in, you are greeted, front and center, with recommended apps and friends' apps. Also, along the left is a menu of categories like Games, Entertainment, Music, and News, through which you can browse. \n \n App Center recommends apps based on the apps that you are already using. The more apps you use with Facebook log-in, the more attuned it will be to your tastes. The Friends' apps section also shows you recommendations, but these are based on, you guessed it, the apps that your friends are using. \n \n Once you find an app you're interested in, you can click through to get all the details. If you'd like, you can also play it right then and there (if it's a Web app) or send an iTunes or Google Play link to your mobile device (for mobile apps). This latter feature is hugely convenient, but when using it, be sure to check what platform the mobile app is available for first. Case in point, I was able to send a Pinterest app link to my Android phone, when in fact, Pinterest is only available on iOS. This caused a Google Play error on my phone. Perhaps a more prominent display of the platform compatibility would help, because as it is now, that information is tucked away at the bottom of the app details page. \n \n (Credit: Facebook) \n \n Meanwhile, on a mobile device the App Center provides a significantly pared-down experience. In fact, it looks quite different from the desktop App Center, which, to me, was a bit disorienting. The App Center on mobile opens up directly to your Friends' apps, but on the phone it's called \"Social Picks.\" Top Apps is another section that you can explore, which lists the most popular mobile apps for Facebook users. \n \n One thing that needs work on the mobile interface is browsing. You can browse through Apps or Games, and that's about it. There are no other categories to help you navigate, like there are on the full desktop version of App Center. \n \n Conceptually, App Center seems like a winner to me. I found its recommendations helpful and the Friends' apps list very interesting, to say the least. All that said, I can honestly say that I'll use it. Still, the interface has some kinks to work out, especially on mobile devices. \n \n If you can't find App Center yet (it is gradually rolling out to users over the next few weeks), you can go to facebook.com/appcenter on your desktop browser or m.facebook.com/appcenter on your mobile device to try it now.",

The phased rollout will ultimately give all its US users access to 600 apps, like Pinterest and Draw Something, reports TechCrunch.

Frank was pronounced dead at 3:35 p.m. Friday. \n \n UPDATE: Federal investigators launch probe into Woodland Hills mail carrier\u2019s death on 117-degree day \n \n Temperatures soared to 117 degrees in the Woodland Hills area on Friday, surpassing the record of 106 degrees for that day, July 6, that was set in 1976. (The National Weather Service has kept records there since 1949, according to Keily Delerme, a NWS meteorologist.) \n \n But Winter could not say Monday whether the heat was a factor in Frank\u2019s death. \n \n While her autopsy had been completed, the cause of death was deferred pending additional tests, Winter said. She also had some type of medical history that Winter declined to specify until the final cause of death is determined. \n \n \u201cWe want to express our thoughts and prayers for the employee\u2019s family at this difficult time,\u201d said Evelina Ramirez, a spokesperson with the U.S. Postal Service. \n \n She noted that carriers deliver mail in \u201call kinds of weather, including high temperatures.\u201d \n \n \u201cSafety is our top priority for all of our employees,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cThe Postal Service strives to ensure that they have the tools and training to do so safely.\u201d \n \n Carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, she said. \n \n \u201cThe most important thing is to make sure they have water and ice for their entire route,\u201d Ramirez said. \n \n Employees at the Woodland Hills Post Office remembered Frank, a dog lover who had some 28 years working at the post office, as always upbeat and positive despite her health challenges. \n \n \u201cShe was a sweetheart \u2013 always happy, even when she wasn\u2019t feeling good,\u201d said co-worker Cindy Pritchard. \n \n Frank had recently returned from medical leave, according to colleagues. \n \n Co-worker Joni Hogan Salvatore, who started working at the Woodland Hills Post Office before Frank, called her colleague \u201camazing\u201d and \u201ca very hard worker.\u201d \n \n \u201cNone of us are 20 (years old) anymore; it\u2019s a hard job,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cIt\u2019s a super-hard job, but she always had something nice to say. Never was a complainer or anything. She was just a really good person.\u201d \n \n Salvatore said that when it\u2019s 100 degrees outside, it can be 10-15 degrees hotter inside the mail trucks, which do not have air conditioning. \n \n \u201cThey make us lock them and seal them for safety of the mail, but it\u2019s horrible in there,\u201d she said. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued an excessive heat warning on Friday for the region. \n \n A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which has jurisdiction over federal employees, could not be reached late Monday for comment. \n \n In the fall of 2014, an administrative law judge upheld a willful citation to a U.S. Postal Service station in Independence, Mo., by the federal OSHA after a mail carrier died in July 2012, according to media reports. \n \n The mail carrier had collapsed while working his route and died as a result of his exposure to excessive heat, according to an OSHA investigation. \n \n That investigation found that the Postal Service \u201cdid not have procedures in place to address worker concerns during times of excessive heat,\u201d according to the administrative agency. A willful violation is one that is committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law\u2019s requirements or with plain indifference to worker or safety health. \n \n The Postal Service was required to pay a penalty of $70,000 in that case, according to the news site Fox4KC.com. \n \n In October of 2016, OSHA cited the Postal Service after two Des Moines, Iowa, workers suffered heat-related illness while delivering mail that past summer. The agency found that the two mail carriers, one of whom was told to continue walking her route despite feeling ill, were exposed to excessive heat. \n \n RELATED STORY: Employees should \u2018force breaks\u2019 in extreme heat, top LA County health official says",

I'm 99.9 percent sure that it wasn't an accident or a suicide.\" Crosby agrees. \"He was not street-smart, so he did hurt himself, from the standpoint \u2013 The autopsy of John Fuller, the former child star who was found dead in his El Paso home last month at the age of 29, has been released, and it shows that the cause of death was accidental, the El Paso Times reports. The medical examiner determined that Fuller, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, died from a \"single, self-inflicted\" gunshot wound to the head. The autopsy also found that Fuller had a blood-alcohol content above the legal driving limit, but below the legal limit for driving in Texas, where the shooting took place. Fuller's former girlfriend, Kristi Williams, who called 911 after finding the body, told the Times that the gunshot was fired from a .38-caliber revolver that Fuller was holding when he died. She said he had been drinking heavily, and that she didn't know why he had taken his own life. Williams said she last saw him the day before he died, when she dropped him off at a friend's house. Fuller, whose early career included roles in The Monkees, Full House, and The Drew Carey Show, had been working as a chef at a Mexican restaurant in El Paso when he was killed. His body was found in his home by his girlfriend's mother \u2013 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is asking the public to keep an eye out for two men\u2014one white, one Hispanic\u2014seen in surveillance video walking away from a West Hollywood apartment building last week with a gun, the Los Angeles Times reports. The men, who have not been identified, are seen at the building's front door on two separate occasions, the Times notes, adding that the surveillance video was taken by a camera worn by one of the men, as well as by another man who was in the building at the time. The other man has been identified as a man in his mid-20s who lives in the same building, but it's not clear if he's the same one seen in the video. The sheriff's department is asking anyone with information on the men to call its tip line.",

    "document": "Well, that was certainly worth the wait. \n \n On Thursday night (March 11), after months of anticipation, leaked on-set photos and rather excellent adventures in hairstyling, Lady Gaga's epic video for \"Telephone\" finally premiered during E! News, and, honestly, if there's something she didn't cram into the clip, well, then we missed it. \n \n Part hyperkinetic pop-culture joyride \u2014 nods to everything from films like \"Caged Heat\" and \"Kill Bill\" to seizure-inducing Japanese television and the color-drenched photography of David LaChapelle \u2014 part electric dance extravaganza, \"Telephone\" is nine-plus minutes of everything you could possibly love about Gaga (and Beyonc\u00e9, who, we're sure you know by now, co-stars in the clip), only amped up to the Nth degree. \n \n It's ambitious, funny and clever, playing much more like a short film than a music video. There are opening and closing credits \u2014 it's important to know that the video was written by Gaga and director Jonas \u00c5kerlund, after all \u2014 elaborate, over-the-top (or barely there) costumes, and a whole lot of celebrity cameos. This cost money, this took time, this was a work of love and blood and sweat and tears (and a whole lot of hairspray). This was worth it. \n \n Opening in an ominous women's prison, we first see Gaga being led to her cell by a pair of, well, let's just call them \"beefy guards.\" She is stripped of her impossibly shoulder-padded dress and left nude, while the other inmates howl, and as the guards shut the door behind them, the one cracks to the other, \"I told you she didn't have a di--\" (a joking nod to those nasty hermaphrodite rumors, of course). \n \n From there, we get glimpses of Gaga's life behind bars \u2014 make-out sessions in the exercise yard (where she is inexplicably wearing sunglasses made out of half-smoked cigarettes), the occasional catfight in the commissary \u2014 and then, after nearly three minutes of introduction, Gaga takes a phone call and the song finally begins, first with just some gentle electronic notes and LG's tender vocals, then morphing into a stuttering electro-pop stomper, complemented by a dance sequence (Gaga and her inmates strutting and climbing dressed only in studded underwear, fishnets and stiletto heels) that's sure to make the censors rather nervous. \n \n Gaga is then bailed out, but not before she busts a Michael Jackson shuffle while one of the guards surfs around on the dating site PlentyOfFish.com (a scene which isn't even the strangest example of product placement in this video). Waiting for her outside the gates is none other than Beyonc\u00e9, driving the so-called \"P---y Wagon\" from \"Kill Bill.\" The two engage in some seriously stilted dialogue \u2014 \"You know what they say: Once you kill a cow, you gotta make a burger\" \u2014 though Gaga's dead-eyed stares at the camera make it very clear that it's all intentionally bad (as the acting in all good \"women in prison\" flicks should be). They then go screaming off into the desert. \n \n They pull into a diner, where Beyonc\u00e9 pours herself into a booth opposite Tyrese Gibson, who is a total jerk \u2014 so much so that B poisons his coffee. We then cut to a delightfully campy sequence titled \"Let's Make a Sandwich\" featuring Gaga standing in a kitchen wearing a folded-up telephone on her head while dancers cavort behind her, wielding salad tongs and assorted cutlery. She then, well, makes a sandwich, being sure to show off the Wonder Bread and Miracle Whip logos (this is the strangest example of product placement), whips through a tightly choreographed \u2014 and, really, pretty clever \u2014 dance sequence and then chomps down on the sandwich. And when was the last time you got to see her do something like that? \n \n It turns out she also makes poison, which she dumps into some honey and delivers to Beyonc\u00e9's booth, dressed as a towering waitress with a telephone dangling in her eye. Gibson smothers his breakfast in the stuff and dies. Unfortunately, everyone else in the joint \u2014 including Gaga's pals the Semi Precious Weapons \u2014 does the same, and they all suffer the same fate. Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9 begin the video's third over-the-top dance number, popping and strutting while the dead bodies lay around them. It's sort of creepy, to be honest. \n \n The two then pile back into the Wagon and head out onto the highway (not before Gaga does a solo performance in front of the vehicle while dressed in an ultra-tight leopard-print number), and as the video reaches its conclusion, they deliver some more of those cheesy lines, join hands and zoom toward the horizon, police sirens wailing in the background. The last thing we see onscreen is text, which promises us \"To Be Continued ... \" because, hey, why not? \n \n So now that it's finally here, what else can really be said about the \"Telephone\" video? To be honest, I'm not sure. It is electric and excellent and alive. It is certainly the best big-budget clip since, well, Gaga's last big-budget clip and probably the best video you'll see all year (well, either that or OK Go's new one). It more than lived up to the hype, which, frankly, few thought it would. But, perhaps most notably, it is an event. You will remember where you were when you first saw it. And when was the last time you could say that about a music video? \n \n With \"Telephone,\" Gaga has entered the rarest of pop stratospheres, up there with the Madonnas and the, gasp, Michael Jacksons. I'm not comparing talent, just ability: ability to wow, to enthrall and put on a show \u2014 one I can only hope is continued sometime very soon. \n \n What did you think of the \"Telephone\" video?

MTV dubbed the high-budget, 9-minute extravaganza a \"hyperkinetic pop-culture joyride\" with homages to films like Caged Heat and Kill Bill. In fact, Bill director Quentin Tarantino acted as a kind of consultant on the video. \"There certainly is a Tarantino-inspired quality in the video,\" Gaga explains to E!

A chartered aircraft with 81 people on board, including the Brazilian first division Chapecoense... (Associated Press) \n \n MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) \u2014 A chartered plane with a Brazilian first division soccer team crashed near Medellin while on its way to the finals of a regional tournament, killing 76 people, Colombian officials said Tuesday. Five people survived. \n \n The British Aerospace 146 short-haul plane, operated by a charter airline named LaMia, declared an emergency at 10 p.m. Monday (0300 GMT) because of an electrical failure, aviation authorities said. \n \n The aircraft, which had departed from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was transporting the Chapecoense soccer team to Medellin's Jose Maria Cordova airport. \n \n The team, from southern Brazil and which had started its journey in Sao Paulo, was scheduled to play Wednesday in the first of a two-game Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional of Medellin. \n \n It wasn't immediately clear if the team switched planes in Bolivia or just made a stopover with the same plane. \n \n \"What was supposed to be a celebration has turned into a tragedy,\" Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez said from the search and rescue command center. \n \n The club said in a brief statement on its Facebook page that \"may God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests traveling with our delegation.\" \n \n Brazil as well as South America's soccer federation extended its condolences to the entire Chapecoense community and said its president, Luis Dominguez, was on his way to Medellin. All soccer activities were suspended until further notice, the organization said in a statement. \n \n Elkin Ospina, mayor of La Ceja, near where the crash took place, said rescuers working through the night had been heartened after pulling three passengers alive from the wreckage. \n \n Authorities and rescuers were immediately activated but an air force helicopter had to turn back because of low visibility. Heavy rainfall complicated the nighttime search, and authorities urged journalists to stay off the roads so ambulances and other rescuers could reach the site. \n \n Images broadcast on local television showed three male passengers arriving to a local hospital in ambulances on stretchers and covered in blankets connected to an IV. All were apparently alive and one of them was reportedly a Chapecoense defender named Alan Ruschel. \n \n The plane was carrying 72 passengers and nine crew members, aviation authorities said in a statement. Local radio said the same aircraft transported Argentina's national squad for a match earlier this month in Brazil, and previously had transported Venezuela's national team. \n \n British Aerospace, which is now known as BAE Systems, says that the first 146-model plane took off in 1981 and that just under 400 \u2014 including the successor Avro RJ \u2014 were built in total in the U.K. through 2003. It says around 220 of are still in service in a variety of roles, including aerial firefighting and overnight freight services. \n \n A video published on the team's Facebook page showed the team readying for the flight earlier Monday in Sao Paulo's Guarulhos international airport. \n \n The team, from the small city of Chapeco, was in the middle of a fairy tale season. It joined Brazil's first division in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s and made it last week to the Copa Sudamericana finals \u2014 the equivalent of the UEFA Europa League tournament \u2014 after defeating two of Argentina's fiercest squads, San Lorenzo and Independiente, as well as Colombia's Junior. \n \n The team is so modest that its 22,000-seat arena was ruled by tournament organizers too small to host the final match, which was instead moved to a stadium 300 miles (480 kilometers) to the north in the city of Curitiba. \n \n \"Chapecoense was the biggest source of happiness in the town,\" the club's vice-president, Ivan Tozzo, told Brazil's SporTV. \"Many in the town are crying.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Joshua Goodman reported from Bogota. Associated Press writer Mauricio Savarese contributed to this report from Rio de Janeiro. ||||| LA UNION, Colombia/CHAPECO, Brazil (Reuters) - The pilot of a LAMIA Airlines plane that crashed in Colombia, virtually wiping out a Brazilian soccer team, had radioed that he was running out of fuel and needed to make an emergency landing, according to the co-pilot of another plane in the area. \n \n The crash on Monday night killed 71 people. Six survived, including just three members of the Chapecoense soccer squad en route to the biggest game in their history, the Copa Sudamericana final. \n \n Avianca co-pilot Juan Sebastian Upegui said in a chat message with friends that the LAMIA pilot told the control tower at the airport in Medellin that he was in trouble. \n \n Priority had already been given to a plane from airline VivaColombia, which had also reported problems, Upegui said. Reuters confirmed the audio message, which local media played on Wednesday, was from Upegui. \n \n After reporting being low on fuel, the LAMIA pilot then said he was experiencing electrical difficulties before the radio went silent. \n \n \u201cMayday mayday ... Help us get to the runway ... Help, help,\u201d Upegui described the pilot as saying. \u201cThen it ended ... We all started to cry.\u201d \n \n The BAe 146, made by BAE Systems Plc, slammed into a mountainside. Besides the three players, a journalist and two crew members survived. \n \n One survivor, Bolivian flight technician Erwin Tumiri, said he only saved himself by strict adherence to security procedure, while others panicked. \n \n \u201cMany passengers got up from their seats and started yelling,\u201d he told Colombia\u2019s Radio Caracol. \u201cI put the bag between my legs and went into the fetal position as recommended.\u201d \n \n Bolivian flight attendant Ximena Suarez, another survivor, said the lights went out less than a minute before the plane slammed into the mountain, according to Colombian officials in Medellin. \n \n Of the players, goalkeeper Jackson Follmann was recovering from the amputation of his right leg, doctors said. \n \n Another player, defender Helio Neto, remained in intensive care with severe trauma to his skull, thorax and lungs. \n \n Fellow defender Alan Ruschel had spine surgery. \n \n Suarez and Tumiri were shaken and bruised but not in critical condition, medical staff said, while journalist Rafael Valmorbida was in intensive care for multiple rib fractures that partly collapsed a lung. \n \n Investigators from Brazil have joined Colombian counterparts to check two black boxes from the crash site on a muddy hillside in wooded highlands near the town of La Union. \n \n Bolivia, where LAMIA is based, and the United Kingdom also sent experts to help the probe. \n \n HOMAGES PLANNED \n \n The plane \u201ccame over my house, but there was no noise,\u201d said Nancy Munoz, 35, who grows strawberries in the area. \u201cThe engine must have gone.\u201d \n \n Wreckage from a plane that crashed into Colombian jungle with Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense, is seen near Medellin, Colombia, November 29, 2016. REUTERS/Fredy Builes \n \n By Wednesday morning, rescuers had recovered all of the bodies, which were to be sent to Brazil and Bolivia.

    "document": "A British biotechnology company called Oxitec has genetically engineered a new breed of olive tree fly that could stop their natural counterparts from ravaging olive trees in Spain. \n \n The altered flies are implanted with a gene that causes female offspring to die in the larval stage. Males will grow old with the gene, and soon won't have anyone to mate with. In a controlled experiment conducted by the UK scientists, according to New Scientist, the population crashed in about 10 weeks. \n \n SEE ALSO: 9 Bug Videos That Will Make You Squirm \n \n Olive tree fly larvae eat through 15% to 30% of the crop each year, making them much more than a nuisance to anyone whose income depends on the fruit. \n \n For now, Oxitec is waiting for the go-ahead from the National Biosafety Commission in Spain. But in Brazil, a similar experiment is well under way in the wild. The scientists have engineered dengue-carrying mosquitoes around the city of Mandacaru to produce offspring that will all die before they can reproduce. \n \n The company claims to have killed off 96% of the dengue mosquito, but there are those who believe their method of doing so is dangerous. \n \n GeneWatch UK, a nonprofit dedicated to investigating how genetic science and technology affects everything from food to society in general, is concerned that this method of species control doesn't have enough oversight. They believe that the relationships this species of mosquito has with other mosquitoes have been oversimplified, meaning the insects could intermingle and cause other populations to deteriorate. \n \n But Oxitec CEO Hadyn Parry says that its method is much more practical and safe than, say, using insecticide. \n \n \"Insecticides will kill many species \u2014 whether the target or a beneficial insect so they can have quite a broad impact in the environment,\" Parry wrote in an e-mail to Mashable. \n \n He also suggested that his method is better for people, too. \n \n \"The mosquito lives and breeds very close to humans \u2014 so they live in and around the home,\" Parry said. \"So with pesticides you need frequent and total access to people\u2019s homes to spray or fog.\" Many people don't want those chemicals near where they live, of course. \n \n Oxitec's main focus for now is on the mosquitoes, but they have developed a few more bugs for different purposes, including one that can control populations of cotton-eaters. \n \n Does controlling populations through genetic tweaking sound safe to you? Let us know in the comments. \n \n Image: Flickr, Reini68 ||||| GM insects are go. Genetically modified versions of a fly that decimates olive trees could soon be released in Spain in an attempt to control the pests. And in Brazil, GM mosquitoes are already at large as part of the biggest project yet involving engineered insects. The aim is to stamp out their natural counterparts, which carry dengue fever. \n \n The techniques are opposed by anti-GM groups, but advocates say they offer a real alternative to spraying insecticides, and have the potential to provide a better and more precise tool to combat agricultural pests and insects that spread human diseases. \n \n The olive fruit fly is a major pest to olive growers in the Mediterranean and California. Females lay their eggs in the fruit and the larvae destroy 15 to 30 per cent of the crop each year as they munch their way to freedom. To tackle this, Oxitec, a biotech company based in Oxford, UK, has submitted an application to the National Biosafety Commission in Spain to release a small contingent of male GM olive flies, in what would be the first field trial of its kind in Europe. \n \n The males are equipped with genes that cause any female offspring they sire to die while they are still in the larval stage, before they have had a chance to reproduce. The idea is that the male offspring inherit the lethal genes and continue to propagate them through the population, until the number of females dwindles to zero and the species crashes. \n \n In lab experiments, the designer flies successfully competed with non-GM males for mates and caused the population to nosedive within 10 weeks (BMC Biology, doi.org/nvd). To check this happens in the wild, the trial would involve releasing the engineered flies under six olive trees in the Tarragona province, draped in mesh netting to prevent escape. \n \n As the Spanish authorities mull the application, Oxitec is continuing with an even bigger trial to combat dengue fever in Jacobina, a city of 50,000 people in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The aim: to run local mosquitoes that transmit dengue out of town. \n \n The principle is almost the same as with the olive flies \u2013 send out an army of male mosquitoes equipped with genes that prevent any offspring, male or female, from reaching breeding age. \"Our males are mating at the frequency we'd hoped,\" says Luke Alphey, co-founder of Oxitec. \n \n In a preparatory field study elsewhere, the team showed its mosquitoes reduced the native population by between 80 and 96 per cent within six months. \"The new programme is less about 'does this work?', and more about the first operational roll-out of this technology,\" says Alphey. \n \n The main benefit of the GM insect method, says Tony Nolan from Imperial College, London, is that it is \"strictly species-specific\" as the insects only seek out mates of the same species. Controlling the pests with insecticides wouldn't be so discriminating. \n \n However, opponents, such as GeneWatch UK, say there are unanswered questions about the insects, whether they will spread unpredictably, for example. They also point out that sites cleared of insects would eventually be reinvaded. Alphey counters that similar work using males sterilised with radiation has shown that reinvasions can be controlled for decades by simply releasing more insects. \n \n This article appeared in print under the headline \"Designer insects join fight against pests and disease\" \n \n New Scientist \n \n Not just a website! \n \n Subscribe to New Scientist and get: \n \n New Scientist magazine delivered every week \n \n Unlimited online access to articles from over 500 back issues \n \n Subscribe Now and Save \n \n If you would like to reuse any content from New Scientist, either in print or online, please contact the syndication department first for permission.

Brown Convention Center that has been set up as a shelter in Houston, Texas, Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017. (AP Photo/LM Otero) (Associated Press) \n \n HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Major dangers for the U.S. Gulf Coast area loomed after an explosion at a Texas chemical plant early Thursday and the threat of major flooding further east near the Texas-Louisiana line as Harvey's floodwaters began receding in the Houston area after five days of torrential rain. \n \n Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, struggled with rising water as the area was pounded with what remained of the weakening storm, while Houston's fire department said it would begin a block-by-block search Thursday of thousands of flooded homes. Assistant Fire Chief Richard Mann said the searches were to ensure \"no people were left behind.\" \n \n The confirmed death toll climbed to at least 31, including six family members \u2014 four of them children \u2014 whose bodies were pulled Wednesday from a van that had been swept off a Houston bridge into a bayou. \n \n \"Unfortunately, it seems that our worst thoughts are being realized,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said after the van that disappeared over the weekend was found in 10 feet of muddy water. \n \n The Houston-area chemical plant that lost power after Harvey engulfed the area in extensive floods was rocked by two explosions early Thursday, the plant's operator said. The Arkema Inc. plant had been left without refrigeration for chemicals that become volatile as the temperature rises. \n \n The Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a tweet that a deputy was taken to the hospital after inhaling fumes. Nine other deputies drove themselves to the hospital as a precaution. \n \n The company shut down the Crosby site before Harvey made landfall last week, but a crew of 11 had stayed behind. That group was removed and residents living within a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) radius were told to evacuate Tuesday after the plant lost power. \n \n Another threat was emerging east of Houston where weather conditions deteriorated close to the Louisiana line. \n \n Beaumont and Port Arthur worked to evacuate residents after Harvey completed a U-turn in the Gulf of Mexico and rolled ashore early Wednesday for the second time in six days. It hit southwestern Louisiana as a tropical storm with heavy rain and winds of 45 mph. \n \n When Harvey paid its return visit to land, it hit near Cameron, Louisiana, about 45 miles from Port Arthur. \n \n Port Arthur found itself increasingly isolated as floodwaters swamped most major roads out of the city. \n \n More than 500 people \u2014 along with dozens of dogs, cats, a lizard and a monkey \u2014 took shelter at the Max Bowl bowling alley in the city, said the establishment's general manager, Jeff Tolliver. \n \n \"The monkey was a little surprising, but we're trying to help,\" he said. \n \n Floodwaters also toppled two oil storage tanks in South Texas, spilling almost 30,000 gallons of crude. It was not immediately clear if any of the spilled oil was recovered. More damage to the oil industry infrastructure is expected to emerge as floodwaters recede. \n \n Forecasters downgraded Harvey to a tropical depression late Wednesday from a tropical storm but it still has lots of rain and potential damage to spread, with 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) forecast from the Louisiana-Texas line into Tennessee and Kentucky through Friday. Some spots may get as much as a foot, raising the risk of more flooding. \n \n For much of the Houston area, forecasters said the rain is pretty much over. \n \n \"We have good news,\" said Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District. \"The water levels are going down.\" \n \n Houston's two major airports were up and running again Wednesday. Officials said they were resuming limited bus and light rail service as well as trash pickup. \n \n At Hermann Park, south of downtown, children glided by in strollers and wagons, joggers took in midday runs and couples walked beside cascading fountains and beneath a sparkling sun. People pulled into drive-thru restaurants and emerged from a store with groceries. \n \n At the same time, many thousands of Houston-area homes are under water and could stay that way for days or weeks. And Lindner cautioned that homes near at least one swollen bayou could still get flooded. \n \n Officials said 911 centers in the Houston area are getting more than 1,000 calls an hour from people seeking help. \n \n Altogether, more than 1,000 homes in Texas were destroyed and close to 50,000 damaged, and over 32,000 people were in shelters across the state, emergency officials reported. About 10,000 more National Guard troops are being deployed to Texas, bringing the total to 24,000, Gov. Greg Abbott said. \n \n In Orange, Texas, about 30 miles east of Beaumont, residents of a retirement home surrounded by thigh-deep water were rescued by National Guardsmen and wildlife officers, who carried them from the second floor and put them aboard an airboat. \n \n Harvey initially came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane in Texas on Friday, then went back out to sea and lingered off the coast as a tropical storm for days, inundating flood-prone Houston. \n \n Harvey's five straight days of rain totaled close to 52 inches, the heaviest tropical downpour ever recorded in the continental U.S. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Frank Bajak, Matt Sedensky and Michael Graczyk in Houston; Diana Heidgerd and David Warren in Dallas; Seth Borenstein in Washington; Paul J.

There was Mali the puppy, his mother recalled, a tabby he called Blu and a Tibetan spaniel named Coco. \n \n So it surprised no one that on Tuesday, Andrew set out to retrieve his sister Alyssa\u2019s cat, D\u2019Artagnan, who had been left behind as the floodwaters rose in Houston. \n \n Andrew drove to the home with his childhood friend, Sean Stuart, and they began wading through several feet of water toward his sister\u2019s two-story house. \n \n Suddenly, the two felt the jolt of an electrical current in the water, said Andrew\u2019s mother, JoDell Pasek. \n \n \u201cYears ago, Andrew had had an accident and broken his ankle severely, and he had plates and pins in his ankle,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that electricity started going to everything in his ankle and he started jumping around.\u201d \n \n Andrew fell into a mailbox on a metal post. \u201cHe told Sean, \u2018Get away from me, I\u2019m dying,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pasek said, through tears. \u201cHe knew immediately that if Sean touched him, he would be electrocuted too.\u201d \n \n Officials in Harris County attributed his death to accidental electrocution, the ninth confirmed storm death in the county. \n \n Sean\u2019s mother called Ms. Pasek to tell her what had happened. \u201cI get that phone call, my son is no longer alive,\u201d she said. \u201cI just started screaming. We\u2019ve been friends since the kids were in kindergarten, so I know it was the hardest thing she had to do.\u201d \n \n Gathered at home in Houston, Andrew\u2019s family was left wondering if they could have stopped him from trying to rescue D\u2019Artagnan. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve all decided that no matter what we would have said, he would have gone anyway,\u201d Ms. Pasek said. \u201cThat was just his nature.\u201d \n \n Donald and Rochelle Rogers \n \n Thelma Hooker has barely begun to mourn her brother, Donald Rogers, 65, and his wife, Rochelle, 58, who drowned in floodwaters on Wednesday while driving their Toyota pickup truck to check on a relative. \n \n \u201cIt just don\u2019t feel real,\u201d she said. \n \n Ms. Hooker is mostly worried about their 91-year-old mother, Lola, who lives at home and is in poor health. The family has yet to tell her the news.

(Associated Press) \n \n HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Now that the sun is finally shining and the murky, brown floodwaters are slowly receding in much of the Houston area, grim reality is setting in. \n \n Harvey is about to release its dead. \n \n In Texas, the official death toll surpassed 30 on Wednesday and was expected to climb as authorities investigated several other deaths to determine whether they were storm-related. Officials fear that the number of fatalities will climb sharply in coming days as neighbors, emergency workers and family members search for the missing \u2014 and discover the bodies of people trapped in waterlogged homes or encased in underwater graves inside cars. And the death toll might rise even further in the recovery phase, from car crashes, carbon monoxide poisoning or other accidents during cleanup. \n \n \"Historically all estimates of deaths are wrong in the beginning,\" said Craig Fugate, who was the Federal Emergency Management Agency director from 2009 until earlier this year. \n \n Already, the nation is shocked by the horrors revealed as the storm moves out of the area and east toward Louisiana and points north. \n \n The first confirmed fatality came early: A man in the Gulf coastal city of Rockport was killed in a fire late Friday as the storm raged ashore. \n \n On Wednesday, officials located a submerged van that seven members of a Houston family had been traveling in when it was swept off a bridge and into a storm-ravaged bayou. Samuel Saldivar told police he was trying to bring his elderly parents and his brother's four grandchildren to safety from their flooded home on Sunday when the van he was driving was tossed by a strong current into the bayou as it crossed the bridge. He escaped through a window but the six others were trapped when the van's partially submerged sliding door wouldn't open. \n \n Also Wednesday, authorities said 65-year-old Donald Rogers and his 58-year-old wife, Rochelle, drowned when they were swept away by a current after driving their pickup truck into floodwaters in a rural area southwest of Houston. Fort Bend County Sheriff's Maj. Chad Norvell said the couple was on the phone with 911 asking for help when the line went silent. When officers found the truck, it was completely submerged. \n \n On Tuesday afternoon, a 3-year-old girl was found alive in a rain-swollen canal, clinging to the body of her drowned mother in Beaumont, Texas. A second woman was confirmed dead in Beaumont on Wednesday. \n \n Earlier Tuesday, the body of 61-year-old Houston Police Sgt. Steve Perez was found in his car. He'd been swept down a flooded road as he drove to his precinct, determined to serve his community. \n \n Eleven other confirmed deaths, some of which were listed on a Harris County database, showed people were found floating in waters \u2014 some in homes or businesses, others near cars. Among those victims was Ruben Jordan, a high school basketball coach, who was last seen late Saturday helping people through floodwaters. His family was informed on Monday that he had died in the floods. \n \n \"The sad thing is, of the deaths we've seen, we're going to see more, unfortunately,\" said Jeff Schlegelmilch, the deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. \"That number doesn't stop moving up until we're well into the recovery phase.\" \n \n No official number of the missing has been released, and a spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff's Office, where Houston is located, said there isn't a specific strategy in place to look for additional bodies. \n \n \"We are going to go out and try to find any potential victims that may be there,\" said the spokesman, Jake Smith. \"We are also encouraging the public if they come across anything, we strongly urge them to call 911 if they find a body or a potential victim.\" \n \n Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said the department had received 47 missing persons reports since Harvey inundated the city and 27 of those individuals have been located. \n \n Photos with pleas for help have been posted on social media, cut-and-pasted and retweeted by thousands of people as desperate family members seek loved ones they fear may be dead \u2014 but who may only have a cellphone without power. The uncertainty is terrifying. \n \n One of the worries, said Schlegelmilch, is that many of the severely flooded neighborhoods weren't in evacuation areas. \n \n Additionally, the people most likely to be found dead are the elderly, the infirm and the people who were isolated from others \u2014 along with folks who didn't have the means or wherewithal to flee. Sometimes it's a matter of having the strength to wade through floodwaters a few blocks to safety, or to pull one's self up onto a roof. \n \n \"Those who are the most vulnerable when the sky is blue, they are also the most vulnerable when the sky is gray,\" Schleglemilch said. \n \n Fugate, the former FEMA head, said it's also common for people to die during the recovery phase, when stress levels are high and people aren't making clear-headed decisions. \n \n \"Stay safe, stay home, stay off the roads if you can. Don't go sightseeing,\" he warned. \n \n Still, experts say there is some good news: They don't expect the death toll from Harvey to come anywhere close to that of Katrina, when 1,800 people died. Many of those flood-related fatalities came when a levee broke and water inundated New Orleans. People were stranded in extreme heat and the federal response was slow. Emergency managers learned painful lessons during Katrina, and have put those lessons to use in this storm. \n \n Residents of New Orleans during Katrina saw top-to-bottom failures at every level, experts said. \n \n During Harvey, \"state and local officials and FEMA were mobilizing, water rescue teams were prepared, in anticipation of this,\" said Fugate, adding that safe shelters were almost immediately in place for Texas residents, unlike New Orleans. \"That provided faster rescues.\" \n \n One other thing seems to have helped Houston in its time of need: the residents themselves. \n \n \"Neighbors helping neighbors,\" Fugate said. \"That will keep the death toll down.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at Http://twitter.com/tamaralush",

    "document": "At some point in the not too distant future, Tom Hardy needs to book himself in for a new tattoo. The 39-year-old British actor has already got quite a few, as the markings protruding from his T-shirt \u2014 and the many topless shots that exist of him on the internet \u2014 attest. He's had the London skyline, a Chinese dragon, his wife's name (and his ex-wife's initials), a Madonna and child and a Buddha with an AK47. This latest one though, he's dragging his heels about. \"I haven't got it yet,\" he says cheerily, taking a deep lungful from his electronic cigarette, \"because it sucks.\" \n \n Hardy had a wager with Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom he starred in last year's The Revenant, a story of betrayal and vengeance among 19th-century fur trappers. DiCaprio predicted that Hardy would get an Oscar nomination for his supporting role as a feral frontiersman who leaves DiCaprio's character for dead after the latter is mauled by a grizzly bear. Hardy bet a tattoo of the winner's choosing that he wouldn't. Hardy lost. Hardy recreates DiCaprio's design on a Post-it note for me. \"He wrote, in this really shitty handwriting: 'Leo knows everything.' Ha! I was like, 'OK, I'll get it done, but you have to write it properly.'\" \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n And he probably will. Hardy's body art is very much a statement of his commitment: to his lovers, to his family, to himself. Also, to his agent. He has her name, Lindy King, tattooed on the inside of his arm, which he said he would do if she ever got him into Hollywood. Thanks to gigs like The Revenant, in which Hardy brought a magnetic savagery to every scene; or 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road, which saw him knock the stuffing back into the moth-eaten action movie franchise; or playing Bane in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises and thereby creating an instantly iconic super-villain who was as terrifying as he was kinky \u2014 she most certainly did. \n \n But Hardy is both in Hollywood and not in Hollywood. He's matinee-idol handsome, with plump lips, smouldering eyes and those much-papped pecs, but he resists playing the pretty, heroic roles his physiognomy was made for. He prefers to play gangsters, villains and psychopaths. And he's very, very good at it. He has an innate, undeniable charisma on screen that puts him at the top of every director's wish list \u2014 all right, as we'll get on to, perhaps not all of them \u2014 but often forgoes behemoth movies in favour of smaller, weirder films in which he can experiment, cut loose. He is steadfastly tightlipped about his personal life, but refreshingly candid about his profession. His friendship is something to be treasured; his enmity is something to be feared. \n \n Also, have you seen the pictures that go with this article? They were Hardy's idea. All of them, from the makeup to the location, to the outfits, to the gun and fruit props. Amazing, right? But also, WTF? Tom Hardy is not your average actor, not your average movie star. In fact, he's not your average man. \n \n He started out averagely enough but quickly demonstrated a reluctance to stay so. Tom Hardy was born on 15 September 1977, the only child of Edward (aka \"Chips\"), an advertising executive and sometime comedy writer, and Anne, an artist. He was raised in East Sheen, a pleasant suburb of west London. He went to nice private schools, where, he told me when we met once before, he \"wasn't the best student\". Drama was a passing interest, though it was encouraged by Chips and Anne because, as he said, \"from a very privileged position I was underachieving and my desperate parents were like, 'Fucking hell, we've got to find something for Tom to do.'\" \n \n Then things got worse. Underachieving turned into serious misbehaving \u2014 including getting caught with a friend in a stolen Mercedes-Benz with a firearm \u2014 which eventually spiralled into a debilitating drink and drug addiction. \"Inside I wanted it to stop,\" he told me when I interviewed him last time for the cover of the May 2015 issue of Esquire, \"but if you get caught out you keep putting your hand in the fire because you're a bad dog and that's what's expected of you. And it's just a waste. Such a waste. I know plenty of people who were born with a nice silver spoon or whatever \u2014 very dead. And died painfully, and unnecessarily.\" \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n He did find his way to the Drama Centre in London and got his first professional gigs in Steven Spielberg's WWII drama Band of Brothers and Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down, both of which came out in 2001. But even with such a high-calibre start, he was in serious danger of losing it. He once admitted, \"I would have sold my mother for a rock of crack,\" and has described the moment he woke up lying in a pool of blood and vomit on London's Old Compton Street with a crack pipe in his hand. He's also told a story of the time he was supposed to meet director John Woo in Hollywood but instead found himself passed out in a bed in downtown LA alongside a naked man he didn't know with a gun and cat (whom he didn't know either). \n \n Eventually, he says, reality bit. \"There were systematically, constantly, things that were put across my path where it was, 'Tom, you need to wake up because there are more important things to do. And you keep on doing stuff that's nonsense, and you of all people have been born with opportunities.' So I had words with myself about the reality of wanking about when there's such a lot to be getting on with.\" He's been sober since 2003, though the impulses are still there. In Canada, he told me about \"Arthur\", the orangutan who is the metaphorical manifestation of his destructive urges, which he likens to Winston Churchill's \"black dog\" of depression. Always present, never to be ignored. \n \n There's an idea that actors should come to roles as blank slates, so that your knowledge of their real lives doesn't detract from the role they're playing, but with Hardy it feels that his experiences add another layer to his performances. It's why he was so captivating as a homeless drug addict in the 2007 BBC adaptation of Stuart: A Life Backwards, so terrifying as Britain's most notorious prisoner Charles Bronson in 2008's surreal biopic Bronson, so convincing as both Ronnie and Reggie Kray in Brian Helgeland's Legend, the 2015 film about east London's most feared mobsters (though they did love their mum). He doesn't have to channel the time his pet goldfish died in order to play characters who have been brutalised or broken; he can play men who stare into the existential abyss because he has stared into it himself. He's got a unique perspective. Or as he told a fellow addiction survivor in a video for The Prince's Trust charity, \"I'm an addict and an alcoholic so I have my ups and downs. My head is a bit wonky.\" \n \n It's early November when we meet in a postproduction house in Soho, central London, and Hardy has a deadline. He needs to finalise the edit on the third episode of Taboo, an eight-part BBC drama which he created with his father, and which he both stars in and is executively producing. Taboo is set in 1814, and Hardy plays James Delaney, an adventurer who returns home from 10 years in the Congo to discover that his recently dead father has bequeathed him an unusual inheritance, which is of interest to both the British and American governments and the East India Company. But, of course, given that it's come from the brain of Hardy, Taboo is not your average costume drama. \n \n However, on that front you're going to have to take my word for it. Before we sit down in an edit suite to watch the episode, I have to sign a non-disclosure agreement. \"You can write what you think,\" says Hardy, \"just not why you think it.\" So we sit there side by side on a black leather sofa as an editor called Serkan plays back the episode on a large screen, Hardy scribbling continuously on an A4 pad and working his way through a stack of four (yes, four) pizzas and a bottle of Diet Coke; me making notes in my own notebook, mostly about the pizzas. \n \n What I can tell you is that Taboo is seedy, gritty, knotty and complex. There are twists and subversions \u2014 even perversions \u2014 of character tropes that make most period dramas look like an episode of Peppa Pig. It was conceived in some ways, says Hardy, to be an \"anti-Downton\", and despite having lush production values that make London, where it is mostly set, look dank and grubby and decadent and sumptuous all at the same time, and boasting a cast of period drama stalwarts including Jonathan Pryce and Tom Hollander, Taboo goes to places that other shows of that genre don't. Let's just say, the title of the show is no accident. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n When it finishes, we move to the kitchen area of the production house, which is off a windowless corridor of closed doors, next to each of which is a sign identifying the programme being edited inside: Poldark, Endeavour, Fortitude. Our conversation is occasionally interrupted by vitamin-D-starved TV types popping in to make cups of coffee, as well as some loud male and female groans repeating over and over from an edit suite across the hall (fighting or schtupping? \"Sounds like a bit of both,\" says Hardy). \n \n Hardy seems fairly relaxed, given that he's under a reasonable amount of pressure. His production company, Hardy Son and Baker, which he runs with a producing partner, Dean Baker, has to send the finished series to the BBC and the American broadcaster, FX, by Christmas so that it can air in January. \"And I've just handed in 14 pages of notes on episode three,\" he points out, without much evident contrition. I ask him how he feels watching the episode back. \"I know every line, and I know where everything is in every scene, and I know where most candles are,\" he says. \"So yeah, I'm never happy.\" \n \n Hardy had the idea for the show when he was playing Bill Sikes in a 2007 BBC adaptation of Oliver Twist, and conceived the character originally as \"a Sherlock Holmes-type detective, a bit more physical as well as smart, but who has that hyper-vigilance; a spiritual, hybrid shaman-cum-cannibal-serial-killer-type thing\". He spent the next nine years going through many different iterations of the idea trying to get it made; and now he has. As Dean Baker puts it, who lets me into the edit suite before Hardy arrives: \"It's very much Tom's baby.\" \n \n Black wool hat, \u00a3145; black denim jeans, \u00a3480,both by Gucci. Necklace, trunks, watch, Hardy's own. \n \n To make matters more complicated, Hardy also had an actual baby at the end of October, with his wife, the actress Charlotte Riley, whom he met on a 2009 ITV adaptation of Wuthering Heights. (He also has an eight-year-old son, Louis, with his ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed.) Three weeks later, he started shooting Taboo, and during those months of production he says he was getting between four and six hours of sleep a night, waking up between 12 and two with \"the little one\" (he lets slip the baby's gender, though he asks me not to print it; he never tells me \"its\" name) and then getting up for work again at 4.30 or 5.30. The sleep deprivation, he says, was a killer: \"If anyone else did that to you you'd have them up at the Hague for war crimes.\" \n \n Now he's nearly finished on Taboo, he plans to book some time off as he's officially \"pantsed\". To be fair, he doesn't look too shabby. In dark jeans and trainers and a The Wolf of Wall Street T-shirt, with a neat-but-not-too-neat beard and short back and sides, he is handsome and looks positively fresh. Which is not exactly how I remembered him. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n When I interviewed Hardy before, it was in Calgary, where he was already several months into shooting The Revenant, which was being filmed in the foothills of the Rockies. (The production would later relocate to Argentina in search of snow.) He was living in a rented house with some friends who were also in the film, apparently whiling away his downtime playing computer games and boxing. He looked hunched, smaller than his 5ft 9in, with a wiry beard and sensible, outdoorsy clothing. He could almost have passed for a local. We were supposed to go to a shooting range; we ended up going to a paint-your-own-pottery shop in a retail park on the outskirts of town. His suggestion. \n \n It was only upon seeing what he did in The Revenant \u2014 his character John Fitzgerald is wild, amoral and animalistic and yet somehow still sympathetic and human, a balance that Hardy is a master at striking \u2014 and then meeting him again in London that I understand quite how much the role must have been absorbing him (and why dabbing glaze on a mug might have made a pleasant change from the day job). Though he resists the pompous terms that surround the craft of acting, calling it \"just face-pulling at the end of the day\", you can't help but feel there's a bit of Method in his madness, whether it's intentional or not. \n \n In Calgary, he was having a little contretemps with the director, Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu over \"some sexy stuff\" I\u00f1\u00e1rritu wanted his character Fitzgerald to do, which Hardy was resisting. \"It's just fucking nauseating having to listen to it every day. Going, 'Yeah yeah yeah; love it, love it, love it; but no.'\" A little later, when he was calmer, he added, \"He's a scallywag, and I'll end up doing it to please him, and there'll be no Oscar at the end of it for me\u2026. Ha ha ha! There might be for him.\" (He was, on both counts, correct.) Later, photos will emerge of Hardy wearing a T-shirt of his own design featuring a picture of Fitzgerald putting I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in a choke-hold. \n \n In London, he admits he's only just recovering. \"Because it's a good two years away it feels\u2026 There are still echoes of exhaustion from it, but I think it's a beautiful film,\" he says. \"I want to watch it again now because I have got a really healthy distance. It's always the way, when people say, 'It was a really tough time in my life when I was in it,' in hindsight it's a very fond memory. At the time it was aarararaghgh\" \u2014 he makes a noise like a fatally wounded buffalo \u2014 \"never ending! The Forevernant. It went on forever and it was confusing. The Forever-and-evernant! It was never-ending, confusion, chaos, none of us were in any form of control, we were being controlled, you know? And that was frustrating and stressful.\" \n \n It's worth noting how unusual that statement is. Not least because it gives you a glimpse into how he speaks \u2014 how his synapses fire off at a mile a minute and you have to grab on to the subject and object of the sentence, if you can find them, and then just hang on for the ride \u2014 but because it's so frank. Though he will add, \"I love Alejandro\", it was very clear that there were large periods during the making of that film that he did not. Unlike so many \u2014 maybe all \u2014 actors at his level, there's none of that game-faced, media-trained blandness from Hardy. And thank God for that. \n \n It's why stories seep out from productions he's been involved with of spats between him and directors or fellow cast members. About how he told a journalist he was \"ready to punch\" Nicholas Winding Refn, his director in Bronson. Or the reports, from both sides, that he'd had a fist-fight with Shia LaBeouf, his co-star in the bootlegging drama Lawless (Hardy said LaBeouf, somewhat implausibly, \"knocked me out sparko\"). Or how he had run-ins with both his co-star Charlize Theron and director George Miller on the set of 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road; he publicly apologised to the latter at the film's Cannes Film Festival press conference. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n But you don't hire Tom Hardy if you don't want Tom Hardy, and for the most part, he'll make it worth your while. It's the friction that creates the spark. \"If I come in as an actor,\" he says on the sofa outside the edit suite in London, \"I check the fragilities and the breaking points for the whole piece and the team, because that's what I get paid to do. So if I don't do that, then I'm not doing you a service or me a service, because that's what we came to do. If someone says, 'No Tom, I don't want you to do that, I just want you to come down the middle in a bat suit,' \u2014 not the Batman suit, I mean literally, in a bat suit \u2014 then you know what? I probably won't do that film.\" \n \n Hardy obviously inspires loyalty in those directors who know how to handle him. On the subject of Batman suits, Christopher Nolan is clearly one such employer, having cast Hardy first in 2010's Inception, as louche dream-cracker Eames, and then in the career-rocketing role of Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, whose costume included a restrictive respirator that proved Hardy could eye-act with the best of them. He has recently finished shooting a few days in an unspecified role in Nolan's Dunkirk, a drama based around the 1940 evacuation of Allied troops from the coast of northern France, which is due to come out in summer 2017 and which, like all Nolan productions, is largely shrouded in secrecy until then (though pictures that leak online appear to show Hardy in the guise of a Spitfire pilot). \n \n Nolan is a director whose approach stands up to Hardy's scrutiny. \"He's a great on-set leader,\" he says, \"as well as a fucking brilliant film-maker and a visionary. I do have thoughts, but the thing about him is that he can contain them \u2014 they don't shock him. And he doesn't want to miss a trick, so if you've got something he'll want to use it. He'll soon tell you, 'That's enough now, thanks,' which is great. Because then you know your boundaries.\" \n \n (Another director who seems more than happy to see Tom Hardy is Daniel Espinosa, the Swedish director of Child 44, a 2015 crime thriller in which Hardy starred as a Soviet soldier on the trail of an infanticidal maniac. Espinosa is in the postproduction house editing something of his own and during our interview he bounds in to say hi, sporting what must be a newly grown ponytail, as Hardy's first reaction upon seeing him is to cry out, \"Yo! You look like a girl!\" before hugging him warmly.) \n \n It's not surprising to hear Hardy describing the usefulness of boundaries. He is a person for whom structure is clearly essential \u2014 not surprisingly then, he shows a keen interest in the military and has lots of soldier friends \u2014 as he seems to possess an internal drive towards flux, maybe even chaos. His mood, as some reporters have discovered, can change with the wrong question, and you won't necessarily be able to predict which one it will be and why. Interviewing him, you feel like you could ask him anything, but you also have to be prepared for any response: it's a definite don't-give-it-if-you-can't-take-it deal. \n \n Tan gabardine trench coat, \u00a31,840; dark red mohair-wool suit, \u00a31,600; Grey silk tie, \u00a3140; sky blue/white cotton shirt, \u00a3345; brown leather belt, \u00a3220, all by Gucci \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n My experiences with him have only been good ones \u2014 he's friendly, entertaining and funny \u2014 but you still feel you have to be on your toes. At one point I bring up his accent, which often meanders from well-spoken London public school boy (which he is), to London rude boy (which he isn't, though like many London public school boys he probably learned the art of camouflage). At our second meeting, unlike our first, he seems to have acquired a northern twang, saying things like \"loovely\" and \"fuhn\". I ask him, innocently enough, if he's rehearsing something set in the north of England. He replies, with a flicker of annoyance, that his wife is from Middlesbrough and his mum is from Yorkshire and it's probably that. Right you are, Tom. I beat a hasty retreat. \n \n On the face of it, it might look like Hardy is starting to toe the Hollywood line. With the release of Mad Max: Fury Road he became a bona fide box office star \u2014 as well as garnering critical acclaim, it grossed close to $400m worldwide \u2014 and with The Revenant he got his first Academy Award nomination. When DiCaprio won the Oscar for best actor, the first person he thanked in his acceptance speech was Hardy, whom he called \"my brother in this endeavour\". Hardy was in the audience, too, with Charlotte, to watch Mark Rylance beat him to the award for best supporting actor. On the TV coverage, Rylance appeared to say something to Hardy as he walked up to the stage; I ask Hardy if he remembers what it was. \"I think he said, 'Fucking amateur.' Hur hur! Or, 'This is how it's done.' Hur! I can't remember. But it was just amazing to be there.\" \n \n The year before, he had watched the ceremony on TV in Calgary with his friends while, for reasons best known to themselves, prancing about in ladies' clothing. Then suddenly he was there in his dickie bow, being praised by DiCaprio and applauded by the establishment. \"I don't think I ever expected to be welcomed to one of those events,\" he says. \"I always felt like a bit of a naughty boy, and I always thought part of me would be like, 'Nah'. And then actually I was like, 'Oh yeah! I'll have a sniff of that.'\" \n \n The whole Oscars experience was made even more surreal by the fact it was the Hardys' first trip away from their new baby. \"Obviously there's that pull and we were both jetlagged and nervous, but fuck me, if you're going to leave home and do anything we really ought to do this,\" he says. \"I've got a photo of us in our outfits underneath the 88th Academy Awards logo, and that's a piece of history, isn't it? That's mum and dad in their heyday. They were there. Wicked.\" [When a reporter approached Hardy while he waited outside the Dolby Theater, he explained, with perfect Enlightened Dad poise, that he was waiting for Charlotte to finish breast-pumping in the bathroom.] \n \n Whether he likes it or not, Tom Hardy is now a major movie star. So what should his next career move be? A romantic comedy? A superhero flick? Somehow you can't quite see him in tights and a cape (unless the Elton John biopic he's been signed onto for ages finally gets off the ground \u2014 and wouldn't that be something?). With his artistic singularity and his mercurial temper and his mutating accent and his scattergun syntax and his monstrous pizza consumption, he's just too wonderfully, blessedly odd. Even if he does have a nice jawline, sticking him in the Batsuit would be a wasted opportunity. \n \n And sure enough, one of the projects that is looming at the start of next year is Fonzo, from director Josh Trank, in which Hardy will play \u2014 wait for it \u2014 an ageing and syphilitic Al Capone. Yes, it's another baddie, and another gangster for that matter, but that hasn't escaped his notice, either. There's clearly something in his psyche that is lured to the darker side of the human experience, perhaps because he's been there himself. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n \"There's a part of me that wants to do different stuff,\" he says, \"but there's a part of me that goes: do you know what? I want to carry on playing gangsters because every time you go a little bit deeper in that study. Why switch it up and be rice-paper thin? 'Oh, he's good because he's doing a musical now!' You know what I mean? It's like, 'Look at me! I'm trying to please people!'\" \n \n Or as he put it to me more bluntly in Calgary, \"I enjoy the nuttery in my work. So that's probably why when somebody goes, 'Do you want to play another loony?' I go, 'Yeah, I would actually, yeah.'\" \n \n There's also supposed to be another Mad Max film, though he's hazy on the timings, plus McCullin, a feature film about the war photographer Don McCullin that Hardy Son and Baker will produce and he will star in. The experience of working on his own stuff should, says Hardy, give him a certain catharsis when returning to his bread-and-butter work as an actor for hire. \"That energy that I had is just misdirected on other people's shows,\" he says. \"As long as I've got an outlet elsewhere then I'm happy to go and fit bathrooms. If someone's built their own house and they want me to come and fit a bathroom, just tell me what you want and I'll come and do it.\" \n \n Maybe. But part of you hopes he won't. Part of you hopes he'll reimagine your bathroom so it's not at all what you were expecting. Or maybe he'll take a sledgehammer to your bathroom and build you a kitchen instead. Or a jungle gym. Or a fucking submarine. \n \n Because you don't hire Tom Hardy if you don't want Tom Hardy. And who wouldn't? \n \n Styling by Nicole Schneider. \n \n Taboo is on BBC1 from 7 January. ||||| Getty Images \n \n Tom Hardy recently added to his extensive tattoo collection, courtesy of Leonardo DiCaprio. \n \n While filming 2016\u2019s The Revenant together, the actors made a super high-stakes bet. Leo was convinced that Hardy\u2019s performance would earn him an Oscar nomination, and Hardy humbly disagreed. As we know now, DiCaprio was correct, and Hardy kept his end of the bargain by getting a tattoo of his oh-so-wise costar\u2019s choosing. Yep, seriously. \n \n Originally, as Hardy told Esquire UK in an interview, the art design wasn\u2019t particularly to his liking. \n \n \u201cHe wrote, in this really shitty handwriting: \u2018Leo knows everything,\u2019\u201d Hardy said. \u201cHa! I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll get it done, but you have to write it properly.\u2019\u201d \n \n And Hardy eventually came through. A photographer in San Francisco recently posted a selfie with the actor, and you can clearly see the words \u201cLeo knows all\u201d peeking out from under his T-shirt, on his right bicep. \n \n Last year, Hardy told Vanity Fair about the unfairness of the bet, saying, \u201cFucker. He would never get a tattoo if he lost that bet! It was just one-way. I\u2019m covered in shit tattoos anyway, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference to me. If I got a big bold \u2018Leo\u2019 right across my thigh or across my face. It\u2019s just that, isn\u2019t it? You bet a tattoo, you lose. That\u2019s what happens.\u201d \n \n Yes, Hardy. Yes, it is. And while it isn\u2019t the world\u2019s most glamorous ink, there are certainly worse things than being a successful actor with a dumb tattoo designed by a fellow movie star that symbolizes your Academy Award nomination. Worse things, indeed.",

A spokesman says the church has received \"mixed response\" to its decision. \"It is a demonstration of our support for freedom, civility, and the peaceful transition of power,\" he says. \u2013 The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is scheduled to sing at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20\u2014but a Change.org petition calling for the choir's ouster is gaining steam, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. According to the petition, the choir is \"not in harmony with the values and principles of Mormonism\" and has \"demonstrated sexist, racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic behaviors\" that don't \" align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" \"The Church's participation will harm this spectacularly talented and beloved Choir's image, misrepresent the diversity of Mormons worldwide, and sends the wrong message to LDS children as they will perceive the church's involvement as endorsement of a man whose words and actions do not align with our values,\" the petition states. The choir has declined to comment on the petition. \u2013 A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir has resigned over the choir's decision to sing at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Jan Chamberlin wrote in a resignation letter to the choir president that she has spent many sleepless nights thinking about the decision. \"I have reflected carefully on both sides of the issue, prayed a lot, talked with family and friends, and searched my soul,\" she wrote. She says she has \"tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man.\" Chamberlin says she believes singing at the inauguration is a \"demonstration of our support for freedom, civility, and the peaceful transition of power\" and she \"certainly could never sing for him.\" Thousands of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have signed an online petition calling on the church to reverse its decision.",

(Associated Press) \n \n One protester was killed in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in clashes with security forces, after a crowd of protesters set fire to a KFC and an Arby's restaurant. Protesters hurled stones and glass at police in a furious melee that left 25 people wounded, 18 of them police. \n \n Protests were held in cities from Tunisia to Pakistan after weekly Friday Muslim prayers, where many clerics in their mosque sermons called on congregations to defend their faith, denouncing obscure movie produced in the United States that denigrated the Prophet Muhammad. \n \n The numbers were not huge _ in most places, only a few hundred took to the streets, mostly ultraconservative Islamists _ but the mood was often furious. The spread of protests comes after attacks earlier this week on the U.S. Embassies in Cairo and the Yemeni capital Sanaa and on a U.S. consulate in Libya, where the ambassador and three other Americans were killed. \n \n After standing aside earlier this week in the face of protesters, security forces in Yemen and Egypt fired tear gas and clashed with protesters Friday to keep them away from U.S. embassies. \n \n Egypt's Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, went on state TV and urged Muslims to protect foreign diplomatic missions _ his first direct public move to contain protests. \n \n \"It is required by our religion to protect our guests and their homes and places of work,\" he said. He also condemned the killing of the American ambassador in Libya, saying it was unacceptable in Islam. \"To God, attacking a person is bigger than an attack on the Kaaba,\" he said, referring to Islam's holiest site in Mecca. \n \n His speech was an apparent attempt to repair strained relations with the United States, which was angered by his slow response to Tuesday night's assault on the embassy in Cairo. Police did nothing to stop protesters from climbing over the embassy walls, and Morsi was largely silent about the breaching for days afterward. \n \n Ahead of the expected wave of protests on Friday _ a tradition day for rallies in the Islamic world _ U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered an explicit denunciation of the anti-Muhammad video, aiming to pre-empt further turmoil at its embassies and consulates. The movie, called \"Innocence of Muslims,\" ridicules the Prophet Muhammad, portraying him as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester. \n \n \"The United States government had absolutely nothing to do with this video,\" she said before a meeting with the foreign minister of Morocco at the State Department. \"We absolutely reject its content and message.\" \n \n \"To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible,\" Clinton said. \"It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage.\" \n \n Nonetheless, protests in several places attempted to move on American diplomatic missions _ and other Western countries were pulled into the dispute. \n \n Several thousand demonstrators protested outside the US embassy in Tunis and battled with security forces, throwing stones as police fired volleys of tear gas and shot in the air. Some protesters scaled the embassy wall and stood on top of it, planting a black flag with the Islamic profession of faith, \"There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.\" \n \n Police chased them off the wall and took the flag down. \n \n In Sudan, a prominent sheik on state radio urged protesters to march on the German Embassy to protest alleged anti-Muslim graffiti on mosques in Berlin and then to the U.S. Embassy to protest the film. \n \n \"America has long been an enemy to Islam and to Sudan,\" Sheik Mohammed Jizouly said. \n \n Soon after, several hundred Sudanese stormed into the German Embassy, burning a car parked behind its gates and setting fire to trash cans. Protesters danced and celebrated around the burning barrels as palls of black smoke billowed into the sky. \n \n Part of the embassy building was also in flames, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told reporters in Berlin. \"Fortunately... the employees are safe,\" he said. \n \n Police firing tear gas drove the protesters out of the compound. Some then began to demonstrate outside the neighboring British Embassy, shouting slogans, while others left, apparently heading to the American Embassy, which is outside of the capital. \n \n In east Jerusalem, Israeli police stopped a crowd of around 400 Palestinians from marching on the U.S. consulate to protest the film. Demonstrators threw bottles and stones at police, who responded by firing stun grenades. Four protesters were arrested. \n \n Security forces in Yemen shot live rounds in the air and fired tear gas at a crowd of around 2,000 protesters trying to march to the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Sanaa. Though outnumbered by protesters, security forces were able to keep the crowd about a block away from the mission. \n \n A day earlier, hundreds of protesters chanting \"death to America\" stormed the embassy compound in Sanaa and burned the American flag. The embassy said nobody was harmed. Yemen's president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, quickly apologized to the United States and vowed to track down the culprits. \n \n In Egypt, several hundred people, mainly ultraconversatives, protested in Cairo's Tahrir Square after weekly Muslim Friday prayers and tore up an American flag, waving a black, Islamist flag. \n \n A firebrand ultraconservative Salafi cleric blasted the film and in his sermon in Cairo's Tahrir Square said it was upon Muslims to defend Islam and its prophet. \n \n Many in the crowd then moved to join protesters who have been clashing for several days with police between Tahrir and the U.S. Embassy. \"With our soul, our blood, we will avenge you, our Prophet,\" they chanted as police fired volleys of tear gas. \n \n Ahead of the clashes, the president spoke for more than seven minutes on state TV, saying, \"It is required by our religion to protect our guests and their homes and places of work.\" \n \n \"So I call on all to consider this, consider the law, and not attack embassies, consulates, diplomatic missions or Egyptian property that is private or public, \" he said. \n \n He denounced the killing of the American ambassador in Libya. \"This is something we reject and Islam rejects. \n \n His own Muslim Brotherhood group called for peaceful protests in Tahrir to denounce the film. \n \n A small, peaceful demonstration was held Friday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. \n \n Hundreds of hardline Muslims held peaceful protests against the film throughout Pakistan, shouting slogans and carrying banners criticizing the U.S. and those involved in the film. \n \n Police in Islamabad set up barricades and razor wire to prevent protesters from getting to the diplomatic enclave, where the U.S. Embassy and many other foreign missions are located. Protests were also held in Karachi, Peshawar and Lahore, where protesters shouted \"Down with America\" and some burned the U.S. flag. About 200 policemen and barbed wire ringed the U.S. Consulate in Lahore. \n \n About 1,500 protest in the eastern city of Jalalabad, shouting \"Death to America\" and urge President Hamid Karzai to cut relations with the U.S. \n \n A prominent cleric in Indonesia urged Muslims there to remain calm despite their anger about the film. But Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, a branch of the international network that advocates a worldwide Islamic state, on its website blamed the U.S. government for allowing the film to be produced and released, calling it \"an act of barbarism that cannot go unpunished.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the airport in Benghazi, the city where Tuesday's attack on the consulate took place, was closed for several hours on Friday. An airport official said the closure was due to security concerns, and the airport re-opened in the afternoon. \n \n _____ \n \n Additional reporting by Osama Alfitory in Benghazi, Libya; Ahmed Al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen; Bouazza Ben Bouazza in Tunis; Mohamed Osman in Khartoum, Sudan; Elizabeth A.

    "document": "Rep. Michele Bachmann has been propelled into the 2012 presidential contest in part by her insistent calls to reduce federal spending, a pitch in tune with the big-government antipathy gripping many conservatives.But theMinnesota Republican and her family have benefited personally from government aid, an examination of her record and finances shows. A counseling clinic run by her husband has received nearly $30,000 from the state ofMinnesota in the last five years, money that in part came from the federal government. A family farm in Wisconsin, in which the congresswoman is a partner, received nearly $260,000 in federal farm subsidies.And she has sought to keep federal money flowing to her constituents. After publicly criticizing the Obama administration's stimulus program, Bachmann requested stimulus funds to support projects in her district. Although she has been a fierce critic of earmarks \u2014 calling them \"part of the root problem with Washington's spending addiction\" \u2014 the congresswoman nonetheless argued recently that transportation projects should not be considered congressional pork.As Bachmann prepares to formally launch her presidential bid Monday in Waterloo, Iowa, Republican strategists warned that she needs to square her record with her public pronouncements.\"She's kind of built an area in the field of candidates where she's the hawk on those kinds of issues, so any sort of issue that will show her record is not totally consistent will affect some of her support,\" said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Iowa GOP. \"I don't think it's a deal-breaker, but I think it's something she's going to have to be willing to confront head-on.\"For now, Bachmann is declining to answer questions on the topic. Her congressional and campaign staff did not respond to numerous requests for comment.Bachmann has long sought to distance herself from those who benefit from public money. \"I don't need government to be successful,\" she proudly told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in fall 2009 when he asked why she inspired such ire among liberal critics.Yet despite her broadsides against \"socialized medicine,\" Bachmann's husband, Marcus, applied for public funds for his counseling clinic, Bachmann & Associates. Since 2006, he has received nearly $30,000, according toMinnesota state records. The bulk of the money \u2014 $24,041 \u2014 came in the form of grants from the state Department of Human Services to train staff how to deal with clients suffering from chemical dependency and mental illness. That program was financed in part by the federal government.Michele Bachmann lists the Lake Elmo, Minn.-based clinic \u2014 which aims to provide \"quality Christian counseling in a sensitive, loving environment,\" according to its website \u2014 as one of her assets on her financial disclosure forms.Another of Bachmann's assets \u2014 a family farm owned by her late father-in-law, Paul Bachmann \u2014 received nearly $260,000 in federal money between 1995 and 2008, largely from corn and dairy subsidies, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research organization that scrutinizes such subsidies. Paul Bachmann died in May 2009, but the congresswoman retains a partnership in the farm.Bachmann said in December that the subsidies went to her in-laws and she never received \"one penny\" from the farm, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. However, in financial disclosure forms, she reported receiving between $32,503 and $105,000 in income from the farm, at minimum, between 2006 and 2009.Publicly, Bachmann has objected strongly to federal farm payments.When she voted against the 2008 farm bill, a $307-billion package that would govern federal agriculture policy for five years, Bachmann declared that it was \"loaded with unbelievably outrageous pork and subsidies for agricultural business and ethanol growers.\" She was one of two nays cast byMinnesota's eight-member delegation.Just a year later, however, Bachmann wrote to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, praising the federal government for helping prop up the prices of pig products and dairy by directly buying the commodities, a move that benefited her constituents.\"I would encourage you to take any additional steps necessary to prevent further deterioration of these critical industries, such as making additional commodity purchases,\" she wrote on Oct. 5, 2009. The Los Angeles Times/Tribune Washington Bureau obtained the letter through a Freedom of Information Act request.The USDA that year had stepped up its purchase of pork and dairy products for use in school lunches and other government food programs, seeking to stabilize prices in the then-flagging industries.While not technically a subsidy, commodity purchase programs are \"a deliberate effort of the government to prop up these industries,\" said David DeGennaro, legislative analyst for the Environmental Working Group.More recently, Bachmann objected strongly to the Obama administration's $830-billion stimulus package, saying before the 2009 congressional vote on the matter: \"I cannot support this new direction for the American economy.\" ||||| While Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., has forcefully denounced the Medicaid program for swelling the \"welfare rolls,\" the mental health clinic run by her husband has been collecting annual Medicaid payments totaling over $137,000 for the treatment of patients since 2005, according to new figures obtained by NBC News. \n \n The previously unreported payments are on top of the $24,000 in federal and state funds that Bachmann & Associates, the clinic founded by Marcus Bachmann, a clinical therapist, received in recent years under a state grant to train its employees, state records show. The figures were provided to NBC News in response to a Freedom of Information request. \n \n The clinic, based in Lake Elmo, Minn., describes itself on its website as offering \"quality Christian counseling\" for a large number of mental health problems ranging from \"anger management\" to addictions and eating disorders. \n \n The $161,000 in payments from the Minnesota Department of Human Services to her husband's clinic appear to contradict some of Michelle Bachmann's public accounts this week when she was first asked about the extent to which her family has benefited from government aid. Contacted this afternoon, Alice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Bachmann, said the congresswoman was doing campaign events and was not immediately available for comment. \n \n Questions about the Bachmann family's receipt of government funds arose this week after a Los Angeles Times story reported that a family farm in which Michelle Bachmann is a partner had received nearly $260,000 in federal farm subsidies. \n \n Read more reporting by Michael Isikoff in 'The Isikoff Files' \n \n When asked by anchor Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the story's assertion that her husband's counseling clinic had also gotten federal and state funds, Bachmann replied that it was \"one-time training money that came from the federal government. And it certainly didn't help our clinic.\" \n \n At another point, she said, \"My husband and I did not get the money,\" adding that it was \"mental health training money that went to the employees.\" \n \n But state records show that Bachmann & Associates has been collecting payments under the Minnesota's Medicaid program every year for the past six years. Karen Smigielski, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said the state's Medicaid program is funded \"about 50-50\" with federal and state monies. The funds to Bachmann & Associates are for the treatment of low-income mentally ill patients and are based on a \"fee for service\" basis, meaning the clinic was reimbursed by Medicaid for the services it provided. \n \n Smigielski added that these were not the only government funds that Bachmann & Associates has received. The clinic also participates in managed-care plans that are reimbursed under a separate state-funded Minnesota Health Care program. But the state does not have any records of payment information to the individual clinics that participate. (During her Fox News appearance, Bachmann was not asked about Medicaid payments, and she made no mention of them.) \n \n Another state official, Patrice Vick, communications manager for the Human Services Department, said she was puzzled by Michelle Bachmann's assertion on the broadcast that the funds under the state grant went to employees. While the grant was to train employees to help them treat chemical dependency, the money did not go directly to those being trained, she said. \"It went to the clinic,\" Vick said. \n \n \"The contract was with the clinic,\" Vick added later. But she had no immediate information about whether the clinic passed it along directly to the employees being trained or used it to cover its costs of training. \n \n Rep. Michele Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, recite the Pledge of Alligence, before she announced her presidential candidacy Monday in Waterloo, Iowa. \n \n The issue of her receipt of government aid has gotten attention because Bachmann, a Tea Party favorite, has been a fierce critic of federal spending programs and has called for drastic cutbacks. This has especially been the case on health care, including the expansions of Medicaid called for under the new health care law. \n \n When Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton signed an executive order earlier this year expanding the state's Medicaid program for more than 95,000 state residents, Bachmann was joined state Republican lawmakers in denouncing the move. \n \n \"Right now, Governor Dayton is wanting to commit Minnesota taxpayers to add even more welfare recipients on the welfare rolls at a very great cost,\" Bachmann said at a news conference in St. Paul in January. \n \n \"She's giving hypocrisy a bad name,\" said Ron Pollock, executive director of Families USA, a consumer health care advocacy group, when asked about the Medicaid payments to Bachmann & Associates. \"It's clear when it feathers her nest she's happy for Medicaid expenditures. But people that really need it \u2014 folks with disabilities and seniors \u2014 she's turning their backs on them.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A clinic run by Michele Bachmann's therapist husband has collected $137,000 in payments from a program lashed by the GOP presidential candidate: Medicaid. Those payments are on top of an additional $30,000 in government grant money for employee training at Marcus Bachmann's clinic. The clinic, which advertises \"quality Christian counseling\" for a range of mental health issues, also participates in a state subsidized health insurance program, notes MSNBC. Revelation of the health care payments\u2014in addition to some $260,000 in subsidies for a Wisconsin farm owned in part by the Bachmanns\u2014is proving an embarrassment to the Tea Party candidate who rips such \"big government\" aid on the campaign stump.

If true, this sucks.https://twitter.com/avnindera1/status/1055903558170824704 \u2026 ||||| Back in April, The Simpsons attempted to address the growing controversy surrounding the character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon with the episode, \u201cNo Good Read Goes Unpunished,\u201d which was heavily criticized for not so much addressing the issue as basically dismissing it. In response to the controversy, Indian-American producer Adi Shankar announced that he was holding a crowdsourcing contest for fan submissions to come up with a better script to be produced by either Fox or as a fan film. \n \n Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t appear that the episode will ever come to fruition because, in a recent interview with IndieWire, Shankar said that he\u2019s heard from sources that The Simpsons is planning to instead quietly write the character off the show. \n \n Shankar blasted the decision as \u201ccowardice\u201d on the show\u2019s part. \n \n If you are a show about cultural commentary and you are too afraid to comment on the culture, especially when it\u2019s a component of the culture you had a hand in creating, then you are a show about cowardice. It\u2019s not a step forward, or step backwards, it\u2019s just a massive step sideways. After having read all these wonderful scripts, I feel like sidestepping this issue doesn\u2019t solve it when the whole purpose of art, I would argue, is to bring us together. \n \n Twitter predictably also had thoughts about the decision to remove the character.

RIP My Mentions \u2014 Hari Kondabolu (@harikondabolu) October 27, 2018 \n \n For what it\u2019s worth, the winning script that Shankar selected was written by Vishaal Buch, an Indian-American family doctor from Bethesda, Maryland, who envisioned Apu going from owning the Kwik-E-Mart to being a thriving businessman. The episode would have focused not just on Apu but would have incorporated \u201cother prominent Indian Americans in hilarious ways to highlight the importance of diversity and individuality through the lens of The Simpsons,\u201d according to Indiewire. \n \n It\u2019s unclear whether Apu would have been voiced by Hank Azaria or an Indian-American voice actor, but either way, it sounds like a huge missed opportunity on Fox\u2019s part. \n \n Update 7:30am CT, Oct. 29: Executive producer and writer Al Jean has pushed back against reports that The Simpsons is writing Apu out of the show. On Twitter, Jean noted that Shankar isn\u2019t a producer and that \u201che does not speak for our show.\u201d \n \n H/T Indiewire ||||| As \"The Simpsons\" side-steps the controversy and character altogether, Shankar will produce the contest winning script through his Bootleg Universe site. \n \n In April producer Adi Shankar launched a spec script contest for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to solve what has become known as the show\u2019s \u201cApu Problem.\u201d The long-running character, a convenience store owner voiced by Hank Azaria, has become a controversial figure because many believe him to be an inaccurate and hurtful portrayal of Indian-Americans. \n \n It was Shankar\u2019s intention to crowdsource a script that \u201cin a clever way subverts him, pivots him, writes him out, or evolves him in a way that takes a creation that was the byproduct of a predominately Harvard-educated white male writers\u2019 room and transforms it into a fresh, funny and realistic portrayal of Indians in America.\u201d \n \n Shankar\u2019s primary hope was that Fox would produce the script as an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d but now that he has found what he calls the \u201cperfect script\u201d and announces the winner of his contest, he told IndieWire that he has heard from people who work for the show that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d is eliminating the character. \n \n \u201cI got some disheartening news back, that I\u2019ve verified from multiple sources now: They\u2019re going to drop the Apu character altogether,\u201d said Shankar in an interview with IndieWire. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to make a big deal out of it, or anything like that, but they\u2019ll drop him altogether just to avoid the controversy.\u201d \n \n Shankar clarified that he got this news from two people who work for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and a third source who works directly with creator Matt Groening. \n \n Reached for comment on Shankar\u2019s allegations, a representative for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d at Fox provided a cryptic response: \u201cApu appeared in the 10/14/18 episode \u2018My Way or the Highway to Heaven.\u2019\u201d In the episode, Apu only appears in a single wide shot (below) that showed dozens of characters gathered around God. \n \n Following Hari Kondabolu\u2019s 2017 documentary \u201cThe Problem with Apu,\u201d \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d poked fun at the controversy in the ironically titled episode \u201cNo Good Read Goes Unpunished\u201d that took a jab at the political correctness of the shows\u2019 critics. Then in May, Matt Reiss, the only original writer still at the show, told Vanity Fair that the show dealt with the Apu problem back in 2016 episode, with the episode \u201cMuch Apu About Something,\u201d and the character has \u201cbarely had a line in the past three seasons.\u201d \n \n Shankar believes the decision to yank the Apu character and avoid the controversy is a mistake, especially for a show known for its social satire. \n \n \u201cIf you are a show about cultural commentary and you are too afraid to comment on the culture, especially when it\u2019s a component of the culture you had a hand in creating, then you are a show about cowardice,\u201d said Shankar. \u201cIt\u2019s not a step forward, or step backwards, it\u2019s just a massive step sideways. After having read all these wonderful scripts, I feel like sidestepping this issue doesn\u2019t solve it when the whole purpose of art, I would argue, is to bring us together.\u201d \n \n Shankar who viewed his contest as an olive branch to the show, has picked a winning script from hundreds of submissions that he believes will be enjoyed by fans on both sides of the controversy. The Grand Prize winner is Vishaal Buch, a family doctor in Bethesda, Maryland. \n \n Courtesy of Coverfly \n \n In Buch\u2019s script, Apu goes from a single store owner to a thriving businessman in Springfield. The spec episode doesn\u2019t just focus on Apu, but pulls in other prominent Indian Americans in hilarious ways to highlight the importance of diversity and individuality through the lens of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe contest was never meant to be an attack against anyone, but I think in a lot of ways we weren\u2019t asking for anything too radical than to be viewed in three-dimensions,\u201d said Shankar. \u201cI think the beauty of Vishaal\u2019s script is it did just that. It wasn\u2019t preachy. It wasn\u2019t hammering us over the head. When a lot of people hear \u2018The Problem with Apu\u2019 they roll their eyes, \u2018there is no problem with Apu, it\u2019s these millennials, they\u2019re out of control.\u2019 I think in a lot of ways those people will really like this episode.\u201d \n \n Buch was like a number of the spec script contestants in that he had never written a screenplay before. In fact, Coverfly, the screenplay submissions management software company that administered the contest for Shankar, is helping the doctor this week translate his winning script into proper screenplay formatting. \n \n \u201cI think as entertainers we can be myopic in our view and it was really refreshing to read a script that was outside of our bubble, our ecosystem,\u201d said Shankar. \u201cIt was clever and authentic.\u201d \n \n What Buch, a former US Air Force pilot, lacked in creative writing experience, he made up for with life experiences and a deep love and knowledge of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d \n \n \u201cI was born in Oklahoma, moved to California, and have gone through all the ups and downs that comes with being an Indian-American,\u201d said Buch. \u201cTo no one\u2019s surprise I ended up in medicine, but what is different is that I actually practice in the US military. When you think of the US military you don\u2019t necessarily think of an Indian guy, but that is how much the Indian-American has evolved. I grew up a huge fan of \u2018The Simpsons,\u2019 so to be able to help tell this story is a testimony to not only my hard work, but the hard work of others like me. It\u2019s been a pleasure to work with Adi and his team, and I am incredibly excited for the journey.\u201c \n \n Shankar noted that the number of doctors who applied to the contest was enormous. He also noted that the guest star most often written into submitted spec scripts, by an extremely wide margin, was Elon Musk. \n \n Project Bootleg \n \n Shankar is working under the assumption \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d will not produce and air Buch\u2019s script, which Shankar is in the process of helping to hone, so he will do it himself through his Bootleg Universe YouTube page. In addition to producing big-budget action films like \u201cDredd\u201d and \u201cThe Grey,\u201d Shankar\u2019s Bootleg Universe has been his outlet to produce short films that reimagine well-known franchises and characters, like James Bond, The Punisher, and most notably a 14-minute short based on the The Power Rangers \u2014 directed by Joseph Kahn, starring Katee Sackhoff and James Van Der Beek \u2014 which racked up over 11 million views in its first 24 hours online and that many believe Saban Film took its cue from in rebooting the \u201cPower Ranger\u201d franchise. \n \n In addition to his work in live-action, Shankar also has roots in the animation world and is the co-showrunner of the animated Netflix series \u201cCastlevania.\u201d Shankar is confident that he is capable of producing an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d that will sound and look like the Fox series. He is also open to inviting \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d voice actors, including Hank Azaria, to lend their talents. \n \n Below is a video Bootleg made for $3,000 to test how it would emulate the art and style of the show. \n \n Shankar also named a second place winner: Tasha Dhanraj, a London-based comedy writer represented by Emily Wraith at Berlin Associates. The producer said he hasn\u2019t 100 percent ruled out producing that script as well, but mostly he wanted to acknowledge Dhanraj\u2019s \u201cincredible talent.\u201d \n \n Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

    "document": "Image: Ger Dekker / Flickr Creative Commons \n \n As twilight descends, nocturnal bat species rouse from their daily resting places to feed, creating spectacular clouds as they pour out of caves en masse. But look closer at Jamaican fruit bat colonies as they emerge from sinkhole caves in Cuba, and you may catch a glimpse of a concurrent macabre ritual: As the bats erupt from the cave, a deadly curtain of Cuban boas hangs in their path, aiming to snatch the winged creatures mid-flight. \n \n \n \n That\u2019s right\u2014these snakes coordinate their attacks, and the result is terrifying. \n \n \n \n Vladimir Dinets, a research assistant professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, was guiding a bird- and mammal-watching tour through Desembarco del Granma National Park, Cuba, when he first noticed the cavern-hunting snakes. Intrigued by the bold behavior, he decided to take a closer look. \n \n \n \n The boas involved could all be found basking near the cave\u2019s entrance during the day, while the bats slumbered in an adjacent chamber separated by a narrow passage. As daylight faded, some of the snakes would move from their warm nooks into the passageway. \n \n There, they would dangle their serpentine bodies from the ceiling, ready to strike as bats flew past. Other snakes would take up similar hunting positions as dawn approached, catching the bats as they returned. During each potential feeding opportunity, Dinets dutifully recorded the position of the snakes as well as their hunting success, or lack thereof. \n \n \n \n \u201cThere is an old dogma stating that reptiles are mostly solitary and stupid. My finding is just one of many recent discoveries challenging it.\u201d \n \n After 8 days of records, Dinets concluded the snakes coordinated their hunts, and published his results in the Animal Behavior and Cognition. The first boa would pick its place. Then, when the next slithered up, it would position itself in near the first. And if a third snake joined in, it would hang with the others, too. Dinets considered that the snakes might all just prefer the same areas of the passage, but no snake chose the same segment twice during the entire study, suggesting coordination, not similar taste in locale. \n \n Advertisement \n \n And that coordination paid off\u2014boas were significantly more likely to capture a meal if they hunted together. \u201cVisual observations suggested that most bats were able to avoid flying near boas when there were one or two boas present, but with three boas present the bats had to fly either within striking distance from one of them (often colliding with the boas) or very low above the passage floor,\u201d Dinets explained in the paper. \n \n \n \n While the snakes coordinated with one another, it\u2019s not quite accurate to say they hunted in a \u201cpack\u201d like wolves, as that implies a social aspect that Dinets didn\u2019t see. \u201cI saw no evidence of direct communication,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cThey just take each other\u2019s positions into account.\u201d \n \n Still, coordination to maximize hunting success is practically unknown in reptiles (crocodilians and monitor lizards are notable exceptions). \u201cThere is an old dogma stating that reptiles are mostly solitary and stupid,\u201d said Dinets. \u201cMy finding is just one of many recent discoveries challenging it.\u201d \n \n Intriguingly, this isn\u2019t the first cave where serpents have been observed hunting bats mid-flight. Writer, ecologist, and wildlife photographer Neil Losin and his colleagues have observed a similar strategy among snakes in Puerto Rico. \u201cWe saw up to 8 boas hunting at the same time, and it\u2019s certainly quite a \u2018gauntlet\u2019 for the bats to run,\u201d he said. But he and his team only observed and filmed\u2014they didn\u2019t perform quantitative science to determine if the boas were coordinating their hunting. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n There\u2019s also the famous Cavern of Serpents near the village of Kantenmo, Mexico, where tourists flock to see snakes snatch bats as they exit for the evening. Again, no one has looked closely for coordination. But given the number of examples of this style of cavern feeding, \u201cit is possible that coordinated hunting is not uncommon among snakes,\u201d Dinets said. \u201cBut it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out.\u201d \n \n Update 5/26: Herpetologists have been reacting to this study on social media, and not everybody\u2019s convinced by the author\u2019s conclusions. David Steen, wildlife ecologist at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, took to Facebook to dispute the idea that the boas are coordinating their attacks, arguing that such behavior is difficult to prove without a controlled experiment.

A new study from UT shows that some snakes coordinate their hunts to increase their chances of success. \n \n Vladimir Dinets, a research assistant professor of psychology, observed the Cuban boa\u2014the island nation\u2019s largest native terrestrial predator\u2014in bat caves for the study. \n \n Many Cuban caves shelter large bat colonies, and in some of them small populations of boas regularly hunt the bats as they fly out at dusk and return at dawn. Dinets noticed that the boas hung down from the ceiling of the cave entrance and grabbed passing bats in midair. He found that if more than one boa was present, the snakes coordinated their positions in such a way that they formed a wall across the entrance. This made it difficult or impossible for the bats to pass without getting within striking distance of at least one boa. \n \n Such group hunts were always successful, and the more snakes were present, the less time it took each to capture a bat. But if there was only one boa, it sometimes failed to secure a meal. \n \n These findings were recently published open-access in the journal Animal Behavior and Cognition. \n \n To date, only a handful of snakes have been observed to hunt in groups, and coordination among them\u2014or among any other group-hunting reptiles\u2014has never been proven, Dinets said. \n \n Only a few of the world\u2019s 3,650 snake species have ever been observed hunting in the wild, so very little is known about snakes\u2019 diverse hunting tactics. \n \n \u201cIt is possible that coordinated hunting is not uncommon among snakes, but it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out,\u201d Dinets said. \n \n He added that observing the Cuban boa, although an amazing spectacle, is becoming increasingly difficult since only the most remote caves still have boas. The boas are being hunted for food and possibly pet trade. \n \n \u201cI suspect that if their numbers in a cave fall, they can\u2019t hunt in groups anymore and might die out even if some of them don\u2019t get caught by hunters,\u201d Dinets said. \u201cA few of these caves are in national parks, but there\u2019s a lot of poaching everywhere.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \n \n CONTACT: \n \n Lola Alapo (865-974-3993, lalapo@utk.edu) \n \n Vladimir Dinets (vdinets@utk.edu)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Time to nix that belief you've been clinging to that snakes are \"mostly solitary and stupid,\" Vladimir Dinets tells Gizmodo. The University of Tennessee researcher has found one particular Caribbean species that apparently hunts together. Dinets' study in the Animal Behavior and Cognition journal details his research on Chilabothrus angulifer, or the Cuban boa, which Tennessee Today notes is the country's largest resident predator on land and which apparently hunts fruit bats in sinkhole caves in a coordinated way. Dinets observed the snakes for eight days in the caves of Desembarco del Granma National Park, where he had noticed they would hang from the ceiling near the entrance at dawn and dusk, ready to pounce when the bats flew in and out of the caves. But it wasn't just random positioning. The snakes hunkered down in close proximity to each other, in seemingly strategic locations, so when the bats tried to pass, they were trapped by a \"hissing, snapping curtain\" of boas, as ScienceAlert puts it. What signified coordination and not just a shared preference for one location: No snake positioned itself in the same \"segment\" twice. Dinets also notes that one to three snakes were present for each hunt; only two boas failed to catch a bat, and both were hunting solo. When successful, it took one boa an average of 19 minutes to catch a bat, but three only 6.7 minutes. What's unclear is how rare this is: There are 3,650 snake species, but the natural hunting habits of just a handful have been studied. \"It will take a lot of very patient field research to find out\" if others hunt like this, too. (Here's how boa constrictors actually kill their victims.)",

    "document": "Looking for news you can trust? \n \n Subscribe to our free newsletters. \n \n \n \n \n \n Today, at 9 a.m. local time in Juneau, the state of Alaska is scheduled to release 24,199 pages of emails Sarah Palin sent and received during her half-term as governor of the Last Frontier. State workers will distribute six-box sets and hand trucks (which must be returned) to representatives of a dozen or so media outfits, including Mother Jones. Immediately, a mad dash will be on, with journalists reviewing (and scanning) these thousands of emails, searching for illuminating or entertaining information regarding the GOP\u2019s number-one political celebrity, who remains a possible 2012 presidential contender. (Shortly after the release, Mother Jones, msnbc.com, and ProPublica will post online a searchable archive of the emails.) This saga began with a request I made almost three years ago. \n \n When John McCain chose Palin as his sidekick, reporters rushed to dig up what they could about the little-known chief executive of the faraway state. As part of that frenzy, I came across a local story about a citizen activist in Alaska named Andr\u00e9e McLeod, who had used the state\u2019s open-records law to request emails sent to and from two of Palin\u2019s top aides over a period of several months in 2008. McLeod suspected that the pair had engaged in prohibited political activity during official business hours. The governor\u2019s office handed over four large boxes of emails, portions of which McLeod used as the basis for filing an ethics complaint. But more intriguing than the documents released was the material withheld: 1,100 emails the state deemed exempt from release because they were covered by the \u201cexecutive\u201d or \u201cdeliberative process\u201d privileges that protected communications between Palin and her aides about policy matters. The subject lines of several of the withheld emails\u2014which were catalogued in a list given to McLeod\u2014suggested that they were not policy-related. Several referred to one of Palin\u2019s political foes, others to a well-known Alaskan journalist. \n \n Though it appeared that Palin\u2019s administration might have abused the exemptions to hide politically inconvenient emails, I thought it was worthwhile to shoot for the moon. On September 8, 2008\u2014ten days after McCain tapped Palin as his running mate\u2014I filed a request with the state for \u201call emails sent and received by\u201d Palin during her entire tenure as governor. \n \n This was the first comprehensive request for the Palin emails received by the state. In subsequent days, other media outlets submitted more-limited requests. The Associated Press and NBC News requested copies of emails sent to and from Todd Palin. Msnbc.com asked for emails between Sarah Palin and certain state employees. CNN requested emails to and from the McCain presidential campaign. \n \n Palin\u2019s use of a private account was arguably improper and perhaps a violation of state guidelines. Why should news organizations and citizens have to pay extra because the governor had decided to engage in state business on a private email account? \n \n I wasn\u2019t sure whether the state could process my request before the November election, when Americans would have to render judgment on the McCain-Palin ticket. That would would entail collecting and reviewing a lot of information. But the state\u2019s initial response, outlined in a September 22 letter, was almost encouraging. The state noted that it would take eight hours of computer staff time to gather the emails and perform \u201csecurity operational management,\u201d whatever that meant. For all this, Mother Jones would have to pay a fee of $2,249.46. But there would be an additional cost for copying. The normal duplication fee, the state said, was 10 cents a page. But for this request the state had opted to use an outside vendor that charged 29 cents a page. And there was no way to tell at the start how many pages would be produced; certainly there would be thousands. \n \n Without knowing what the final fee would be, Mother Jones decided to proceed, and the state revised the initial fee covering the search to $590.96. That seemed a like bargain. I sent in a check. We were on our way. \n \n But soon, a big problem materialized. News reports revealed that Palin had used a private Yahoo email account to conduct state business. (This account was soon hacked.) I asked Palin\u2019s office whether it would be collecting emails related to state business sent to and from this account. Linda Perez, the administrative director of the Alaska governor\u2019s office, replied, \u201cWe are unable to access records from the nonstate email accounts as we are not the account owner or customer of the providers.\u201d \n \n Regarding this Yahoo account, the state, Perez reported, could only gather emails that Palin had sent to or received from the official email accounts of other state employees, including her aides. But doing so would require searching the accounts of dozens of other state employees at a cost of $960.31 per account. Perez noted that searching through the email of all state employees would result in an exorbitant fee. But, she added, there were 68 employees within the executive offices of the governor. This meant a limited search would cost about $65,000. \n \n I protested. Palin\u2019s use of a private account was arguably improper and perhaps a violation of state guidelines. Why should news organizations and citizens have to pay extra because the governor had decided to engage in state business on a private account? I requested that the fees associated with searching these 68 accounts be waived. Days later, the news emerged that Palin had used a second private account to communicate with a small circle of staff members\u2014further complicating the effort to gather her emails. \n \n Palin had in effect created a challenge for the state (especially its IT workers), and the state agreed to drop all search fees. Officials returned my check for $590.96, while noting that the request still would probably end up costing between $7,000 and $13,000 in copying fees. (Mother Jones, msnbc.com, and ProPublica agreed to cover these costs, share the documents, and jointly develop the online archive.) But now the major issue was time. Recovering the emails from Palin\u2019s various official and nonofficial accounts and then reviewing those messages would take a while. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to estimate,\u201d Perez told me, with a sigh, in October 2008. \n \n At this point, it was obvious there would be no Palin emails released before the election. Though the state could have gone ahead and collected and reviewed emails from her state account\u2014which presumably would have taken less time\u2014it insisted on making those official emails a part of the more comprehensive and time-consuming project. \n \n The long wait began. As the governor\u2019s office began processing the request, every few months it asked the state attorney general for an deadline extension. And the AG (always a Republican) said yes. \n \n In December 2008, the state\u2014which had lumped together most of the various media requests\u2014told us that it had collected about 25,700 relevant messages. (It was compiling emails from the official accounts of 51 state employees, not 68.) But the state noted that it would take 33 days merely to print them out\u2014and then the lawyers would have to start reviewing the documents to determine if any material should be withheld or redacted. The state declined to say how long the legal review would go on. At the end of January 2009, the senior assistant attorney general in charge of the review noted in a memo, \u201cUnfortunately, we have made little progress.\u201d He reported that his department had been unable to \u201cbatch-print the email records in the format provided\u201d and that each email had to be opened individually and converted to a PDF file. \n \n Throughout the months, the state reported various glitches. For instance, at one point its techies realized that the format for state employees\u2019 email addresses had changed during the period in question from @[department].state.ak.us to @alaska.gov. Consequently, IT staffers had to collect data from twice as many accounts as initially anticipated. \n \n The senior assistant attorney general in charge of the review noted in a memo, \u201cUnfortunately, we have made little progress.\u201d \n \n In February 2009, acting attorney general Richard Svobodny declared that he had designated the ongoing email review \u201ca very high priority\u201d for the state\u2019s Department of Law\u2014as he granted another extension. The following June, he noted that the department had devoted \u201cover 4,000 hours to providing legal review and advice on public records at a cost to the state of $450,000,\u201d and he granted another extension. \n \n When Palin resigned as governor in July 2009, the governor\u2019s office asked the journalists seeking her emails if we were \u201cstill interested in the requested records.\u201d Yes, we replied. Two weeks later, the state\u2019s Department of Law wrote a memo reporting that it had a team of six attorneys and four paralegals and associate attorneys on the case. It claimed it had \u201ccontinued to make significant progress.\u201d Still, more extensions came and went. (In June 2010, the state did release to msnbc.com and NBC News nearly 3,000 pages of emails Todd Palin had exchanged with state officials. ) \n \n This past December, the state reported that it had identified 26,553 pages of emails, and the lawyers had reviewed less than one-third of this trove. More time was needed. But Alaska attorney general David Sullivan demanded that the governor\u2019s office submit a work plan that would state when the request would be finished, and a target date was set: May 31, 2011. \n \n Now, another six months later, the governor\u2019s office has missed that date, but by only 10 days. Not bad, considering. The final fee ended up being a reasonable $725.00 for copying. \n \n But what\u2019s coming? Or, more important, what\u2019s not? The state has informed us that it is withholding 2,353 pages. And the released documents will contain redactions. There may be no way to tell if the suppressed material was excised legitimately. (The state, as I noted above, doesn\u2019t have a sterling record on this front.) The lawyers who reviewed the emails and recommended deletions worked for Palin or her successor Gov. Sean Parnell, who served as Palin\u2019s lieutenant governor. Citizens might be excused for wondering if politics (or Palin protection) was a concern among the redacters. The lawyers suggested material to block; the governor\u2019s office rendered the final decision. \n \n Also, because Palin used those personal email accounts for official communications, this collection will not be comprehensive. Emails that were sent to or from her personal email to people other than those 51 state employees\u2014even if these communications involved state business\u2014will not be part of this batch, nor will emails that Palin sent from her personal accounts to the personal accounts of aides and other state officials. By using personal accounts for official business, Palin has been able to evade, in part, the open records rules of her state. \n \n Still, it is hard to envision a release of so many pages that won\u2019t contain valuable nuggets for those who want to better understand Palin, who has been all over the news of late. For months, as other leading Republicans have been stating their intentions regarding the presidential race, Palin, who has declined to indicate whether she might enter the contest, seemed somewhat eclipsed within the political-media firmament. But she recently took steps to elevate her profile, including a stunt-like family bus tour of historic sites imbued with patriotic meaning. She quickly returned to the headlines, dominating the political news\u2014even crowding out announced candidates. A Palin presidential reality show, at the moment, appears a greater possibility. And opposition researchers in the various GOP presidential campaigns are, no doubt, eager to peruse these records. \n \n So perhaps the Palin emails are arriving at an appropriate time. The request I placed during the last presidential campaign might end up affecting the current one. ||||| FRIDAY: More than 24,000 pages will be available in Juneau. \n \n JUNEAU -- The state of Alaska will release thousands of Sarah Palin's emails from her first two years as governor today, a disclosure that has taken on national prominence as she flirts with a run for the presidency. \n \n The emails were first requested during the 2008 White House race by citizens and news organizations as they vetted a vice presidential nominee whose political experience included less than one term as governor of Alaska and a term as mayor of the small town of Wasilla. The nearly three-year delay has been attributed largely to the sheer volume of the release and the flood of requests. \n \n The state is releasing the more than 24,000 pages of emails in paper form only and asking news organizations to pick up several boxes' worth of documents in Alaska's capital city, accessible by only air or water. Reporters from several news organizations have already begun arriving in Juneau and are making various plans to disseminate the emails to the public. \n \n Palin told Fox News Sunday that \"every rock\" that could have been kicked over to uncover things in her family has been. But she also said \"a lot of those emails obviously weren't meant for public consumption\" and that she expected people might seek to take some of the messages \"out of context.\" \n \n But there may not be any surprises to Palin in the emails. Once the state reviewed the records, it gave Palin's attorneys an opportunity to see if they had any privacy concerns with what was being released. No emails were withheld or redacted as a result of that, said Linda Perez, the administrative director for Gov. Sean Parnell, who has been coordinating the release. \n \n The voluminous nature of the release, the isolation of Juneau and the limited bandwidth in the city of 30,000 people have forced media outlets to come up with creative ways to transmit the information. The Washington Post is looking for \"100 organized and diligent readers\" to work with reporters to \"analyze, contextualize, and research the emails.\" The New York Times is employing a similar system. \n \n Msnbc.com, Mother Jones, ProPublica and are working with Crivella West Inc. to create a searchable database of the emails. (The Anchorage Daily News is partnering with ABC News to scan the paper documents and make them available to readers online.) The Associated Press also plans to scan the paper copies to make searchable files available to its members and clients. \n \n The state said it was not practical to provide electronic versions of the emails. \n \n It's not clear yet whether the 24,199 pages being released will contain any major revelations, but they will provide a fresh look at the inner-workings of her office from the time she took office in December 2006 to her ascension to vice presidential nominee in September 2008. Requests have been made for emails from her final 10 months in office. The state hasn't begun the process of reviewing those yet. Palin resigned partway through her term, in July 2009. \n \n Prior records requests have shed light on the Palin administration's efforts to advance a natural gas pipeline project and the role played by Palin's husband in state business. \n \n The email release adds another dimension to the vetting of Palin that began in 2008 and comes as she has become a prominent national political figure, attracting large crowds during a recent bus tour across the Northeast. Palin's attorney referred questions about the emails to the treasurer of her political action committee, who did not immediately respond Thursday. \n \n The emails were sent and received by Palin's personal and state email accounts, and the ones being released were deemed to be related to state business. \n \n She and top aides were known to communicate using private email accounts. Perez said Palin gave the state a CD with emails from her Yahoo account, and other employees were asked to review their private accounts for emails related to state business and to send those to their state accounts. \n \n Another 2,275 pages are being withheld for reasons including attorney-client, work product or executive privilege; an additional 140 pages were deemed to be \"non-records,\" or unrelated to state business. \n \n Some emails may have been previously reviewed in other, earlier public records requests, such as in the Troopergate investigation, in which Palin was accused of putting pressure on public safety officials to fire her brother-in-law, an Alaska State Trooper who was going through a bitter divorce from Palin's sister. \n \n Clive Thomas, a longtime Palin observer who's writing a book on Alaska politics, said he's not sure what the emails will contain -- or whether their contents will affect people's perceptions of Palin. \n \n \"I guess most people, I think, who don't like Sarah Palin are hoping there's something in there that will deliver the final sort of blow to her (politically),\" he said. As for Palin's supporters, he said he doesn't think their opinion of her will be changed regardless of what comes out.",

Some highlights from the day's coverage: Mother Jones editor-in-chief John Bresnahan explains how he got the request in the first place. \"Though it appeared that Palin\u2019s administration might have abused the exemptions to hide politically inconvenient emails, I thought it was worthwhile to shoot for the moon,\" he writes. \"I wasn \u2013 When Mother Jones sued for access to Sarah Palin\u2019s emails, the state of Alaska charged it $590.96\u2014and it didn\u2019t know how many pages it would produce. \u201cWithout knowing what the final fee would be, Mother Jones decided to proceed, and the state revised the initial fee covering the search to $590.96.

He is set to unveil his pick at the White House in prime time on Monday night. \n \n Democrats and some Republicans are pressuring Trump to pick a nominee who in their view is not intent on overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion across the country in 1973. Trump has said recently that he will not ask candidates about their stance on the case as he prepares to make his decision. \n \n Here's who top conservatives and allies of the president want to see Trump pick for his next nominee: \n \n Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSupreme Court fight becomes battle for Kavanaugh\u2019s papers GOP senator warns against 'fishing expedition' for Kavanaugh documents It\u2019s time we start thinking about post-Trump America MORE (R-Ky.): Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman \n \n Though he hasn't backed anyone outright, the Senate Majority Leader is reportedly nudging Trump toward nominating Kethledge or Thomas Hardiman, because they present \"the fewest obvious obstacles to being confirmed,\" The New York Times reported Saturday. \n \n According to the Times, McConnell has told Trump and White House counsel Don McGahn in multiple phone calls that he fears another top pick, Kavanaugh, would have a hard time securing the Senate's confirmation. The Times reported that McConnell has raised concerns over Kavanaugh's extensive paper trail from his 12 years as a D.C. Circuit judge, in addition to his posts as White House staff secretary for former President George W. Bush and assistant to Ken Starr, whose investigation ultimately led to the impeachment of former President Clinton. \n \n Hugh Hewitt: Raymond Kethledge \n \n Conservative MSNBC commentator and radio host Hugh Hewitt has pushed publicly for Trump to nominate Kethledge, a judge on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, whom he has described as the \"best choice\" in the White House's search for \"Gorsuch 2.0,\" referring to Trump's successful nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. \n \n Hewitt specifically pointed to Kethledge's willingness to challenge a company's \"deference toward the vast administrative state, a doctrine dangerous in its corrosive effect on self-government,\" in a Washington Post op-ed this week. He also cited the advantage of nominating a judge such as Kethledge from swing-state Michigan. \n \n Joining @craigmelvin on @MSNBC next hour to talk #SCOTUS and Judges Barrett, Kavanaugh and Kethledge.

In the piece, Schlapp pointed to a number of rulings that favored conservatives, such as an opinion against a decision upholding ObamaCare's contraceptive mandate and a dissenting opinion against a ruling that upheld a ban on semi-automatic rifles. \n \n \"He literally wrote the book on judicial precedent, with Justice Gorsuch as one of his co-authors.

Bush administration. \n \n \"The fact that Kavanaugh\u2014like so many conservatives his age\u2014worked for Bush 43 is a nonsensical reason to oppose him for SCOTUS,\" she tweeted. \n \n The fact that Kavanaugh\u2014like so many conservatives his age\u2014worked for Bush 43 is a nonsensical reason to oppose him for SCOTUS. 12 yrs of STELLAR opinions. \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) July 6, 2018 \n \n Memo to any concerned conservatives: Brett Kavanaugh would be a PHENOMENAL SCOTUS Justice.

Kethledge, he added, would be an acceptable second-choice pick. \n \n Jim DeMint: Mike Lee \n \n Former Sen.

Kennedy on the Supreme Court, according to Republican officials briefed on the conversation. \n \n While careful not to directly make the case for any would-be justice, Mr. McConnell made clear in multiple phone calls with Mr. Trump and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that the lengthy paper trail of another top contender, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, would pose difficulties for his confirmation. \n \n Mr. McConnell is concerned about the volume of the documents that Judge Kavanaugh has created in his 12 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as well as in his roles as White House staff secretary under President George W. Bush and assistant to Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton.",

Bush. McConnell has also told Trump he could lose two Senate votes (Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins) with another apparent contender, Amy Coney Barrett, who has trumpeted socially conservative views and may be more likely to overturn Roe v. Wade. McConnell is also aware that with John McCain away fighting brain cancer, the GOP has only 50 votes, and libertarian-leaning Rand Paul could be a wild card.

It would only open a few inches, enough for Seng to see a glimpse of his grandfather Touch Chea, 73, and grandmother Sorn Sreap, 71, on the floor. \n \n For a moment he thought he was seeing some kind of a bad joke. \n \n \u201cI wanted to have hope and faith,\u201d he said. \n \n But Sreap was nude from the waist down, Seng said. \n \n He screamed at his wife to call police and broke the large window facing the alleyway to get inside. \n \n Accounts of what happened next are imprecise. \n \n Seng says he stormed through the house in a panic, finding his 2-year-old daughter and his 90-year-old great-grandmother, who has dementia. \n \n There was also a partially clothed man in the house. He was trying to run out the front door. \n \n \u201cI said, motherf---er, did you murder my motherf-----g family?\u201d Seng said. \n \n The two men fought. Both threw punches. A neighbor who heard the screams arrived to help but the man escaped. \n \n Police arrested Active a block away moments later. He was wearing boxer shorts, said Anchorage Police Department detective Slawomir Markiewicz. \n \n Chea and Sreap were killed by \u201cblunt force trauma,\u201d and had injuries to their faces, police said, though an autopsy to formally determine a cause of death hasn\u2019t been completed. \n \n Detectives say the 2-year-old girl and Sorn Sreap had both been sexually assaulted. The toddler was taken to an area hospital where she underwent surgery for her injuries. \n \n The 90-year-old great-grandmother in the apartment was apparently unharmed, Seng said. \n \n She hasn\u2019t been able to communicate with police due to her dementia, said Markiewicz. \n \n It appears that Active entered the apartment through a window left unlocked, he said. \n \n On Sunday, Seng stood near the boarded-up window of the apartment. \n \n His knuckles were bloodied from the fight and he wore a parent visitor badge for the pediatric unit of a local hospital. \n \n His grandparents were loving people who happily put up with his \u201chard-head self\u201d as a child and teenager, he said. \n \n Sreap and Chea, who are Cambodian, mostly raised him. They lived between Tacoma, Wash. and Anchorage. \n \n They loved to play bingo and often babysat their great-grandchildren, he said. \n \n The apartment on North Bragaw Street was home to not only his immediate family but members of the couple\u2019s extended family. \n \n It felt safe, Seng said. \n \n \u201cI know everyone around here,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows me.\u201d \n \n But Seng did not know Jerry Andrew Active. \n \n Active is a registered sex offender who listed his residence as the Anchorage Correctional Complex as recently as February. \n \n A 2009 Alaska State Trooper dispatch says Active was arrested on suspicion of entering a Togiak home and sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl while the family slept, then assaulting all three members of the household. \n \n He served time in jail for attempted sexual abuse of a minor and trespassing in 2010 and 2011, court records show. \n \n Court records show Active was charged with violating his probation this spring but it\u2019s not clear how recently he was incarcerated or what kind of correctional supervision he was on at the time of the alleged crime. \n \n Documents show that he was supposed to be on probation until at least 2014. \n \n On Sunday, Active appeared in court with a black eye. He tried to cover his face from news cameras with papers. \n \n Active had initially refused to give his name to police \u2014 he was first identified as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d \u2014 but prosecutors said they were now certain of his identity, which was revealed in charging documents. \n \n Active said he needed a lawyer and was assigned one from the state Public Defender Agency. \n \n Prosecutor Jenna Gruenstein said the charges against Active and his criminal history made him an \u201cextraordinary danger to the community, to a degree that we rarely see in Anchorage or Alaska.\u201d \n \n Most chilling, she said, was the fact that it appears that the suspect targeted his victims at random. \n \n Such crimes are unusual, said Markiewicz. \n \n \u201cBetween 80-90 percent of homicide victims know the suspects,\u201d he said. \u201cRandom homicides are very rare.\u201d \n \n Now detectives are focused on finding out more about the circumstances surrounding the killings. \n \n Some questions will be answerable in time, the detective said: where Active was in the hours and days before his alleged crime, and whether he was drunk or on any drugs at the time. \n \n Reach Michelle Theriault Boots at mtheriault@adn.com or 257-4344.",

One of them, 23-year-old Brenda Carrillo, recalls to the Los Angeles Times that she was dumbfounded as the waiter elaborated, \"I need to make sure you're from here before I can serve you.\" The four women complained to a manager and left the restaurant, and Carrillo's sister, Diana, then posted about their treatment online.

Grenell served as the U.S. spokesman at the United Nations from 2001 to 2008, and then worked as a contributor to Fox News. \n \n The U.S. Senate confirmed Grenell on April 26, making him the highest-ranking openly gay official in the Trump administration. The next day, he joined Trump at the White House to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks that produced little movement on trade disputes or the Iran accord. \n \n Trump had nominated Grenell in September but key Democrats help up his confirmation, citing concerns about what they called Grenell\u2019s history of making statements insulting to women politicians on the internet and during television appearances. \n \n Asked about such comments during his confirmation hearing, Grenell said he was trying to be funny, not insulting, and would not have made such statements while serving as a U.S. public official. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

It's all due to this tweet, made shortly after Trump spoke: \"As @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran\u2019s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.\" Reuters notes Grenell has himself long-opposed the nuclear deal. That sentiment aligns with the White House's\u2014indeed, Grenell, a former Fox News contributor who Page Six notes had an \"A-list\" going away bash, subsequently tweeted that he directly lifted the language from documentation provided to him by the administration. But the Washington Post observes that \"the timing and tone struck some German politicians, journalists and businessmen as offensive and inappropriate.\" It characterizes the tweet as coming off as a threat and rounds up plenty of reaction, including this from the leader of the country's Social Democratic party: \"It\u2019s not my task to teach people about the fine art of diplomacy, especially not the US ambassador.

    "document": "(CNN) Indonesian searchers battled bad weather Wednesday in their efforts to find more remains from AirAsia Flight QZ8501, a day after the first signs of debris were spotted. \n \n There was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been located underwater. \n \n One search official told CNN that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea. \n \n \"I think that that's the case,\" said Muhammad Hernanto, the head of search and rescue for the city of Surabaya, where Flight 8501 began its journey on Sunday. He was dialing back earlier comments he made to CNN in which he said the sonar equipment had located wreckage from the plane. \n \n Indonesia's national search and rescue chief said the body of the aircraft hasn't yet been discovered. \n \n \"Until now, we haven't found the plane,\" Bambang Soelistyo said, according to Indonesia's national news agency Antara. \"We've only found seven bodies to this day.\" \n \n The grim discovery Tuesday of parts of the missing plane and several bodies on the surface of the sea dealt a heartbreaking blow to families whose loved ones were lost. \n \n Debris was found 100-200 kilometers (60-120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. \n \n Seven bodies -- four men and three women -- have been recovered from the water so far, Soelistyo said. One of the women found was wearing a flight attendant's uniform, he said. \n \n Search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane, including its so-called black boxes. Those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight, which lost contact with air traffic controllers on Sunday with 162 people aboard. \n \n Sonar equipment has been searching the bottom of the sea, tens of meters below the water's surface, according to SB Supriyadi, the search agency's director of operations. \n \n Dozens of ambulances were lined up in the Indonesian city of Surabaya, ready to carry any bodies recovered. \n \n The search isn't easy; heavy wind and rain, as well as big waves, are hampering efforts, officials said. \n \n Families' anguish \n \n As families watched a live news conference Tuesday about the discovery of the debris and saw video of a helicopter lowering a diver to what appeared to be a floating body, some people fainted. Stretchers were brought into the room. \n \n Family members burst into tears, dabbing their eyes as officials passed out tissues. Some sat with their eyes full of tears, hands covering their mouths or heads buried in their hands. Others had phones jammed against their ears. \n \n \"Everyone became hysterical, especially the mothers. One mother even blacked out,\" said Maria Endang Wirasmi, whose daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. \n \n Her husband, Imam Sampurno, said he was relieved the plane had been found. \n \n \"We hope that our children will be saved by a miracle,\" he said. \n \n AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes told reporters he hoped there was \"at least some closure\" for families. \n \n \"My heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in QZ 8501,\" he tweeted. \"On behalf of AirAsia my condolences to all. Words cannot express how sorry I am.\" \n \n Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate. \n \n Military crew spotted an object's shadow \n \n Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said the debris was discovered when a crew on a military aircraft spotted the shadow of an object that looked like a plane in the water off the coast of Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province on Borneo. \n \n Further searching found floating objects believed to be the bodies of passengers, and then what appeared to be an emergency exit of the plane. Officials sent other search teams racing to the area. \n \n Several nations are contributing resources to the effort, including the United States. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Sampson arrived Tuesday. \n \n JUST WATCHED Jet in water deep as a 10-story building Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jet in water deep as a 10-story building 02:22 \n \n The USS Fort Worth is also being prepared to deploy from Singapore, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. It \"can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly,\" he said. \n \n The United States is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help, he said. \n \n Search and rescue teams are diverting all their resources to where the debris is, in the Karimata Strait, about 110 nautical miles southwest of the Indonesian city of Pangkalan Bun, AirAsia said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Is air travel in Asia growing too quickly?

MUST WATCH Is air travel in Asia growing too quickly? 02:16 \n \n Unanswered questions \n \n Fernandes said the focus for now must remain on the recovery effort, and no sweeping changes were planned for the airline, which has 1,000 flights a day. \"But rest assured,\" he said, that once the investigation is done, if \"there are things we need to change, that we will change it.\" \n \n The Airbus A320-200 lost contact with air traffic control early Sunday shortly after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of bad weather, according to Indonesian officials. \n \n Authorities mounted a huge effort to find the aircraft, mapping out a search zone covering 156,000 square kilometers. \n \n Questions remain about why Flight 8501 lost contact with air traffic control and what happened afterward. \n \n Some experts have said the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. \n \n Analysts have also suggested the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines. \n \n The key to understanding what happened is likely to be contained in the aircraft's flight recorders. \n \n \"Until we get the black boxes, we won't know what's going on with the engines,\" said Bill Savage, a former pilot with 30 years of experience. ||||| Some of the victims' relatives at Subaraya airport \n \n The first bodies have been recovered from the AirAsia plane crash site but many of the relatives waiting at Indonesia's Subaraya airport are increasingly frustrated. \n \n They cannot understand why there has not been more concrete news over the last 24 hours. \n \n Kezia has lost five members of her family. They were all wiped out when the flight went down. \n \n Kezia lost five members of her family in the crash \n \n She has given DNA to officials to try and expedite the identification process - when the corpses of her relatives are found. \n \n She said: \"I have so many precious memories that are gone....

Most of the people on board were Indonesian and the country is dealing with a national tragedy. \n \n I meet Vivi just outside the crisis centre where she is close to tears. \n \n Her sister was on board the aircraft and although she knows she is dead she tells me she still prays for the impossible. \n \n She said: \"I don't know what to say. I just hope for a miracle. I just want a miracle to happen.\" \n \n But there is also fury in some quarters. \n \n Inside the crisis centre there is no hope; that disappeared on Tuesday when uncensored video showing a corpse floating in the water was broadcast onto a big screen without warning. \n \n Play video \"Latest Update From AirAsia Boss\" Video: Latest Update From AirAsia Boss \n \n It was the moment Aldilia Sutanto found out her family was dead - like many she's angry and says the TV channel should apologise. \n \n She said: \"I feel this is not good to show it to us like that. It is not ethical.\" \n \n Crucial to the investigation will be finding the flight data recorders. \n \n Aviation experts believe the plane may have crashed whilst trying to evade a catastrophic storm. \n \n For the moment though the massive international recovery effort will continue and with it the grief and anguish of the relatives. ||||| PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Bad weather hindered efforts to recover victims of AirAsia Flight 8501 on Wednesday and sent wreckage drifting far from the crash site, as grieving relatives prayed for strength to endure their losses. \n \n Indonesians hold candles to pray for the victims of AirAsia Flight 8501 in Surabaya, Indonesia, Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2014.

(Associated Press) \n \n \"Help us, God, to move forward, even though we are surrounded by darkness,\" the Rev. Philip Mantofa, whose church lost about 40 members in the disaster, told families gathered in a waiting room at the Surabaya airport. \n \n The massive hunt for 162 people who vanished Sunday aboard the Airbus A320 traveling from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, was severely limited due to heavy rain, wind and thick clouds. Seven bodies, including a flight attendant in her red AirAsia uniform, have been recovered, said Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency chief Henry Bambang Soelistyo. \n \n Sonar images also identified what appeared to be large parts of the plane, but strong currents were moving the debris. \n \n Conditions prevented divers from entering the choppy Java Sea, and helicopters were largely grounded. But 18 ships continued to scour the narrowed search area, and four of the seven corpses were recovered Wednesday. Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency predicted conditions would worsen, with more intense rains, through Friday. \n \n \"It seems all the wreckage found has drifted more than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from yesterday's location,\" said Vice Air Marshal Sunarbowo Sandi, search and rescue coordinator in Pangkalan Bun on Borneo island, the closest town to the site. \"We are expecting those bodies will end up on beaches.\" \n \n The airliner's disappearance halfway through the two-hour flight triggered an international search involving dozens of planes, ships and helicopters from numerous countries. It is still unclear what brought the plane down. \n \n Its last communication indicated the pilots were worried about bad weather. They sought permission to climb above threatening clouds but were denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the jet disappeared from the radar without issuing a distress signal. \n \n The aircraft's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes, must be recovered before officials can start determining what caused the crash. Items recovered so far include a life jacket, an emergency exit window, children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food. \n \n Malaysia-based AirAsia's loss comes on top of the still-unsolved disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March with 239 people aboard, and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine, which killed all 298 passengers and crew. \n \n Simple wooden coffins \u2014 numbered 001 and 002 \u2014 with purple flowers on top contained the first two bodies, which were sent from Pangkalan Bun to Surabaya for autopsies. The two victims were a woman wearing blue jeans and a boy. The other five bodies \u2014 three male and two female \u2014 will remain on a warship until the weather clears. \n \n Nearly all the passengers were Indonesian, and a large portion were Christians of Chinese descent. The country is predominantly Muslim, but sizeable pockets of people of other faiths are found throughout the sprawling archipelago. Around 10 percent of those in Surabaya, the nation's second-largest city, are Christian. \n \n On Wednesday, around 100 relatives gathered for the airport prayer service where Mantofa urged them to hold onto their faith, despite their pain. About 40 members of his Manwar Sharon Church died in the crash. \n \n \"Some things do not make sense to us, but God is bigger than all this,\" he said. \"Our God is not evil.\" \n \n Before breaking up, those gathered stood together and sang with their hands reaching upward. \"I surrender all. I surrender all,\" they repeated. \"I surrender all to God our savior. I surrender all.\" \n \n Many family members had planned to travel to Pangkalan Bun, 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the area where bodies were first spotted, to start identifying their loved ones. However, Surabaya airport general manager Trikora Hardjo later said the trip was canceled after authorities suggested their presence could slow down the operation. \n \n Instead, some relatives gave blood for DNA tests in Surabaya, where the bodies will be transported, and submitted photos of their loved ones along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier. \n \n Nearly all the passengers from Indonesia were frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays. \n \n It was 13-year-old Adrian Fernando's first trip to the city-state and was supposed to be a fun vacation with his aunt, uncle and cousin before school resumed. \n \n \"He is my only son,\" said his emotional mother Linca Gonimasela, 39, who could not accompany him because she had to work. \"At first, he didn't want to go, but later on he was persuaded to join them for the New Year holiday.\" \n \n A number of Indonesian cities have opted to cancel or tone down their planned New Year's Eve celebrations. However, a giant street bash was still in the works for the capital, Jakarta. \n \n In Surabaya, hundreds stood in a drizzle holding candles in a park. \n \n \"Let us pray for the grieving families of those on board the plane,\" Mayor Tri Rismaharini told the crowd. \"Let us pray this will be the last tragedy for Surabaya.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Ng reported from Surabaya, Indonesia.

Seven bodies, including the flight attendant, have been retrieved, said Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency chief Henry Bambang Soelistyo. Sonar images also identified what appeared to be large parts of the plane, but strong currents were moving the debris. The Guardian reports that the plane's black boxes, which hold flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders, are believed to be on their way to Singapore. \u2013 Four more bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of AirAsia Flight 8501 today, but the search for 162 people still missing is extremely limited due to heavy rain, wind, and thick clouds. \"It seems all the wreckage found has drifted more than 30 miles from yesterday's location,\" says the search coordinator in Pangkalan Bun on Borneo island, the closest town to the site. \"We are expecting those bodies will end up on beaches.\" Sonar images have identified what appears to be large parts of the plane, but strong currents are moving the debris, reports the AP. Four bodies\u2014including that of a flight attendant in her red AirAsia uniform\u2014were found today, along with a life jacket, an emergency exit window, children's shoes, a blue suitcase, and backpacks filled with food.

    "document": "* May 7 roadshow means stock may debut May 18 -source \n \n * Zuckerberg to be involved in roadshow -source \n \n * Regulatory review of Facebook IPO near completion -source \n \n By Alistair Barr and Alexei Oreskovic \n \n SAN FRANCISCO, May 1 (Reuters) - The roadshow for Facebook Inc's initial public offering is scheduled to start on Monday, meaning the company's shares should begin trading on May 18, a source familiar with the process said on Tuesday. \n \n Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has mostly operated in the background during Facebook's closely watched journey to public markets, will be involved in the roadshow, another source said. \n \n Facebook declined to comment. \n \n Many on Wall Street had not expected Zuckerberg to turn up on the roadshow after he skipped a March analysts' meeting, ceding the stage to COO Sheryl Sandberg and CFO David Ebersman. His March absence irked some investors who were indignant that the CEO, while wielding near-absolute control over the eight-year-old firm, had snubbed Wall Street. \n \n IPO roadshows, in which company management presents its strategy to prospective investors, typically last one to two weeks. If the roadshow goes particularly well, shares sometimes start trading a few days earlier. \n \n Facebook is set to raise at least $5 billion in what will likely be the largest Silicon Valley IPO ever. The world's largest social network continues to command keen investor interest although disappointing first-quarter results raised questions about whether it can sustain breakneck growth for the longer term. \n \n A source familiar with the offering said last week that a recent acquisition spurt by the company could have added about a week to the IPO timetable as regulators signed off on the deals. \n \n This review is close to completion, however, allowing the company to go ahead with the roadshow on May 7, according to the source who spoke with Reuters on Tuesday. The sources did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about the company's IPO. \n \n \"I have not seen as broad-based interest in an IPO since Google. Investor demand is immense,\" said Scott Sweet of research firm IPO Boutique. \"I expect a roadshow that will rival all roadshows where investors will be turned away at the door.\" \n \n The news on the road show was first reported by tech blog AllThingsDigital and the Wall Street Journal. ||||| This afternoon, rumors began to circulate that Facebook may begin its IPO roadshow as early as Monday of next week. Given the update to the S-1 released last week with slowing metrics and its recent acquisition of Instagram, one wonders, why is Facebook going public now? Should investors be worried? \n \n I wrote about Facebook in March, citing its accelerating revenues, earnings and membership growth. At that time, growth remained strong and margins were intact. Gross margin was improving and operating margin appeared to be inline. The financials reflected the strength of Facebook\u2019s unique position in the world of a destination where people wanted to go every day and provide all the data about themselves that marketers cared to learn. \n \n Last week, Facebook updated its registration statement with first quarter results showing decelerating growth. To be fair, Facebook\u2019s growth had already slowed year-over-year from 154% to 2010 to 88% in 2011. Yet, from Q1 2011 to Q1 2012, revenue growth was 45%, a more substantial deceleration than one would expect. \n \n Slowing user growth is okay IF you can earn more money from your users; however the trends are going in the opposite direction for Facebook. Margins have come under pressure. All costs have increased, with cost of revenues up nearly 300 basis points, and operating income margin dropping from 52% to 47% for the full years of 2010 to 2011. But the drop in operating margin from Q1 2011 to Q1 2012 is more staggering: from 53% to 36%. This is concerning because the end result is that EPS to shareholders, that is investors, is dropping. \n \n That trend could continue. Facebook earns over 80% of revenues from ads. Yet an increasing number of users are accessing Facebook from mobile devices and Facebook (not unlike the rest of the world) has not figured out how to deliver ads effectively to mobile devices. It\u2019s a double-edged sword: If Facebook doesn\u2019t deliver to mobile devices, some other company will topple its social dominance. If Facebook dominates the mobile arena, it cannibalizes its own ability to earn ad revenues without an obvious revenue-generating replacement. \n \n Another area that may give investors pause is the Instagram transaction, both in process and in valuation. According to many reports, Mark Zuckerberg decided to do the transaction, negotiated the transaction and informed the board of his transaction. One of the risk factors cited in Facebook\u2019s registration statement is Zuckerberg\u2019s control of Facebook. If the reporting is true or close to it, then this is an example of the shareholders being subject to Zuckerberg\u2019s decisions. This is not to say it wasn\u2019t a good decision or direction, it is to say that the normal checks and balances that a board has over senior management may not be very strong here. \n \n The second question is the valuation placed on Instagram. It is also noted that Instagram was days away from closing on a funding round valuing the company at $500M. Zuckerbeg paid twice that, based on a valuation of Facebook stock of $77B. Yet Facebook was \u201ctrading\u201d at just over $100B on the secondary sites at the time, so he may have paid an even higher valuation. Why does someone pay twice the current \u201cmarket\u201d valuation? Presumably, it is because he needs the asset. Instagram has had stunning success on a purely mobile platform and Facebook needed a more robust mobile strategy. Should investors be alarmed that Facebook did not see this coming and develop the capability itself, or view it as a tremendously swift strategic move? \n \n As an investor who likes the Facebook story, I would prefer Facebook to post another quarter in order to reverse its margin compression and to prove its ability to leverage the Instagram transaction into a revenue-generating mobile strategy. To date, mobile has been a double-edged sword for Facebook. Prudence would suggest delaying the IPO one quarter and prove a stronger model. Going public now raises the question: is this as good as it gets? ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

    "document": "So I bought The 50th Law. Like most non-musical projects involving 50 Cent, his co-authored book of Machiavellian strategy stood a good chance at being mindlessly entertaining, and fuck-- I wouldn't mind being as rich as he is. Surely, I'd learn some sort of hustling tactic that would allow me to make back my $20 and then some. It held up its end of the bargain on the first part, but amidst the surprisingly practical advice and hilariously revisionist history (a staged thrashing of an Interscope office is remembered as a PR coup for Curtis. Kanye West isn't mentioned once in the book), there was little insight to 50's music-making process. The \"50th law\" essentially lionizes fearlessness and a deep connection with the public, qualities almost entirely absent from his last two albums-- Curtis sounded a hell of a lot like a rap record made by a guy who lives in a Connecticut mansion, while the profoundly bored War Angel LP only served as proof of how the mixtape game he revolutionized had completely passed him by. \n \n But 50's nothing if not calculating, and while Before I Self Destruct might not be designed to reach the pretty impressive first week sales of Curtis, it may be a wiser move making it to appeal to listener who still might be rooting for the guy. In other words, the sort of guy who thought \"Blood Hound\" and \"Back Down\" were by far the best tracks from Get Rich or Die Tryin'. It's transparent pandering on the level of \"Amusement Park\", but the difference is that 50 still can rap convincingly about his financial power moves whereas every bit of sexual pursuit simply bores him to death-- he can't even really make a love song about his guns these days (see \"Hold Me Down\"). \n \n He's still got that voice, and when he wants, it can still intoxicate and overwhelm with sheer menace. \"The Invitation\" and \"Death to My Enemies\" snarl with a ferocity that's refreshing in the context of 50's recent output as well as the current hip-pop landscape where meat'n'potatoes gangsta is actually kinda novel. He disarmingly sings along with the Jackson 5 sample that begins \"Then Days Went By\" before reshaping his \"Hate It or Love It\" verse into a squalid blaxploitation that makes you think he'd view Precious as a comedy. There's the part where a trip to the South turns into a murder spree and he pistol-whips his drug-addled uncle, but it's his staggering anti-romance that provides the most creepy shock: \"she was 20, I was 12/ Nana said she raped me/ I just smiled ear to ear saying 'take it, baby, take it.'\" \n \n As good as the ruffneck stuff generally is, he's way more entertaining when he's fucking around with people. On that note, \"So Disrespectful\" is the most successful track, in that it'll be the one that gets talked about. We can argue about the moral implications of using other people's serious problems as comic fodder, but 50 has no such use for that. He starts off using the Game's claims of sexual molestation against him and just goes from there, railing on anonymous hangers-on and, most comprehensively, former ally Young Buck: \"tell momma he done smoked the TV/ I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G.\" * * \n \n A production team including Dr. Dre, Rick Rock, and Polow Da Don ensure that the cold and clinical Aftermath sonic architecture constantly allows Before to reek of amorality and fuck-you money. It's apt since you could make the argument that Before is something of a concept album portraying human relations in purely transactional terms-- it's not called a \"social contract\" for nothing. There's genuine hurt residing deep within a lot of the tracks here, but nearly every time, it's rendered financially and finds 50 going from playful to extremely bitter as the album goes on. Regarding the dissolution of G-Unit, he jokes \"keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy,\" but later, \"Strong Enough\" becomes one of the angriest tracks he's done in years. On \"So Disrespectful\", even his absentee father is seen as a drain on his bank account: \"I don't even know him/ So now the fuck I owe him?\" If there's any line that could serve as Before's thesis statement, it's this song's closer: \"Enemies stay enemies/ But friends they change/ Niggas go crazy over money.\" \n \n But the fun of talking about the record overstates its actual quality. After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run. The middle bogs down in post-2001 Aftermath muddle and by the second half, he's back trying to make would-be hits again without the inevitability. It's almost like even he's unsure of his hitmaking abilities, and in a weird way, that sorta softens him. But who really wants that? The eyeball-scorching Terminator cover becomes apt-- its creators wanted to have it seen as humanizing allegory, but the consumer just wants to see a remorseless killing machine in action. ||||| Enlarge By Lionel Deluy, Interscope Records Before I Self Destruct is rapper 50 Cent's first album since 2007's Curtis. Interactive Calendar Interactive Calendar \n \n What's 50 Cent 's value in today's hip-hop market? Returning after a backlash over his pop-rap crossover hits, the once-bulletproof Eminem prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is banking on the familiar tropes and narratives of '90s gangsta rap to hike interest in his stagnating career. Before I Self Destruct (* * \u00bd out of four), in stores Monday, isn't likely to renew 50 Cent's currency. Though packed with tough beats, dense production and 50's most ferocious delivery in years, the gloats about shootings, drugs and bloody 'hoods feel about as fresh as a Saw sequel. With the release of 2003's Get Rich or Die Tryin', which sold 1.7 million copies in its first 11 days, 50 Cent joined Eminem and Dr. Dre at rap's summit, solidifying his position with 2005's The Massacre, which moved 1.14 million copies in four days. In 2007, Curtis opened with first-week sales of 691,000, behind chart-topper Kanye West's Graduation with 957,000. In an era of declining CD sales, those numbers showed clout, but 50 Cent, the target of tepid reviews and waning radio attention, clearly was losing ground. The Massacre's lighter, radio-friendly fare, plus 50's mainstream hawking of branded vitamin water, condoms and Power fragrance, had fans doubting his street cred. Enter this fourth solo effort, which comes bundled with a DVD of the same-named movie, which 50 wrote, directed and stars in. The album is a throwback to gangbanger glory days, where kindness is a weakness and body counts are badges of honor. Guns, dope, cash and booty demarcate success. If some of Self Destruct's thug themes sound tired, Fitty doesn't. He comes across as tough and determined to re-establish himself as gangsta rap's kingpin, even if that genre has receded from hip-hop's bling-encrusted hub. Reminding listeners of his first entrepreneurial rise as a crack dealer, he slings boastful, stinging rhymes with a careless brutality, slugging away in 50-Centric rants at enemies, peers, former allies, ex-girlfriends. He's rap's Grinch: a grouchy, resentful loner. While he stumbles on Gangsta's Delight, a meek retooling of Sugarhill Gang's Rapper's Delight, he's sharp on the fierce So Disrespectful, hurling venom at rivals Young Buck and The Game. Amplifying this Scarface paranoia are the darker production textures, courtesy of Dr. Dre, Tha Bizness, Scott Storch and others. While 50's street tales are hardly wholesome, they seldom stoop to the noxiousness of the clumsy soft porn peddled in such comically oafish tunes as Could've Been You with R. Kelly. Fitty's slurry flow fares better against foil Eminem on Psycho, as they merrily one-up each other in a brilliant verbal pas de deux of escalating depravity. It shows what 50 Cent is capable of when he's taking cues from a pro instead of taking shots at a foe.

Here's what they're saying: The album is \"a concept album portraying human relations in purely transactional terms,\" but \"it's not called a 'social contract' for nothing,\" writes Jon Caramanica at the Atlantic. \"It's almost like even he's unsure of his hitmaking abilities, and in a weird way, that sorta softens him. But who really wants that? The eyeball-scorching cover becomes apt\u2014its creators wanted to have it seen as humanizing allegory, but the consumer just wants to see a remorseless killing machine in action.\" \"There's genuine hurt residing deep within a lot of the tracks here, but nearly every time, it\u2019s rendered financially and finds 50 going from playful to extremely bitter as the album goes on,\" writes Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly. \"The fun of talking about the record overstates its actual quality. After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run. The middle bogs down in post-2001 Aftermath and by the second half, \u2013 50 Cent\u2019s new album, Before I Self Destruct, is getting mostly solid reviews: \u201cThe middle bogs down in post-2001 Aftermath muddle and by the second half, he's back trying to make would-be hits again without the inevitability,\u201d writes Leah Chernikoff for Entertainment Weekly. \u201cBut who really wants that? The eyeball-scorching cover becomes apt\u2014its creators wanted to have it seen as humanizing allegory, but the consumer just wants to see a remorseless killing machine in action.\u201d The album is \u201ca throwback to gangbanger glory days, where kindness is a weakness and body counts are badges of honor,\u201d writes Lionel Deluy for USA Today. \u201cHe comes across as tough and determined to re-establish himself as gangsta rap's kingpin, even if that genre has receded from hip-hop's bling-encrusted hub.\u201d But in the Los Angeles Times, Jon Caramanica isn't so sure. \u201c50's street tales are hardly wholesome, they seldom stoop to the noxiousness of the clumsy soft porn peddled in such comically oafish tunes as Could've Been You with R.

So far at least half a dozen people have been picked up, according to parish officials. Dozens of people on Plaquemines' east bank, south of St. Bernard Parish, reportedly are stranded, some in attics to escape flood waters that may have reached 5 to 9 feet in certain areas. \n \n There are also as many as 65 people on the Belle Chasse/Scarsdale ferry landing in Plaquemines Parish, officials said. A search and rescue operation is underway there. Officials have received reports that the water is a foot from the top of the levee. \n \n There is a nursing home in the Jesuit Bend area on the west bank that was not evacuated, and the Governor's office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness wants to try to evacuate it. \n \n The parish levees on the east bank are about 8.5 feet, though some are as high as 12 feet. Some estimates have storm surge at 13 feet; corps officials this morning put the figure at 12.5 feet. Corps officials are saying that there are no confirmed reports of breaches, which suggest failures in levees. \n \n Story by Benjamin Alexander-Bloch and Rebecca Mowbray Staff writers \n \n The National Guard was to launch a larger rescue effort this morning, coming into the east bank through St. Bernard Parish. After the wind subsides, other water and air rescue efforts will follow. \n \n While federal levees in the area appear to be holding, problems in Plaquemines Parish are occurring in areas not protected by the federal system, which was revamped after Katrina. \n \n Along with the problems at Braithwaite, the levee overtoppings on the east bank are also affecting the Bel Air near White Ditch at River Mile 65. Parish officials have also received calls from a woman at Willspoint on the east bank who is claiming she received 9 feet of water and is in her attic. There are reports that the Woodlawn fire station, between Braithwaite and White Ditch, which received no water during Katrina, has been inundated with 5 feet of water. \n \n Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said he wants to cut a hole in the Mississippi River levee to drain the Braithwaite area. But the Army Corps is opposed to the plan and hopes to get pumps brought to the area. \n \n \"My reaction is big and as many as you've got,\" Col. Edward Fleming, district commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, said of the pumps. \n \n When the storm is over, the distinction between a federal and non-federal levee will become salient, but for now, the Corps is able to help. Corps engineers are working on getting Plaquemines officials a hydrograph of the back of the levees by Jesuit Bend, so they can get a better handle on what they might be dealing with there. \n \n Col. Fleming said Plaquemines officials need to think about getting better pumping capactity down there for future storms. \n \n Guy Laigast, director of Plaquemines Parish's emergency preparedness, said some points may have seen winds of up to 110 mph. \n \n \"The devastation of my house is worse than Katrina and the flooding in Woodlawn is worse than Katrina, so those things tell me that the damage on the east bank is worse than Katrina,\" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said this morning. \n \n When the daylight hit, parish officials and others were planning to get out and start examining the parish, \"like fleas,\" said James Madere, a parish GIS analyst who will help assess damage. \n \n Mark Riley, the deputy director of Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness who is stationed in Plaquemines this morning, told a Times-Picayune reporter that rescue operations would occur as soon as it was safe. \n \n \"The standard is we don't want to put first responders' lives in jeopardy and until there stops being an immediate threat to their lives we cannot put their lives at risk,\" Riley said. \n \n It appears from current reports that as Isaac moves upward, it might start pushing water out of the east and into the west. Parish officials are now heavily monitoring Barataria Bay, which reportedly raised 2 feet in the last 90 minutes, from about 4:30 a.m. to 6 a.m. \n \n The fear is that water would get pushed into Plaquemines' west bank levees and affect residents in Myrtle Grove and the Jesuit Bend area. While many of the homes along the levee in Myrtle Grove are raised about 14 feet, many of the Jesuit Bend are not as high. ||||| Utility companies say more than 500,000 have lost power as Hurricane Isaac moves through southeast Louisiana, bringing wind, rain and flooding. \n \n Most of the outages Wednesday are in areas around New Orleans as Isaac lashes the area with 80 mph winds. \n \n The Category 1 hurricane has pushed water over a rural levee to flood some homes, knocked out power and immersed beach-front roads in Louisiana and Mississippi as it makes a drenching slog inland from the Gulf of Mexico. \n \n Wind gusts of more than 60 mph and sheets of rain pelted New Orleans, where people braced themselves for the storm behind levees that were strengthened after the much stronger Hurricane Katrina hit seven years ago to the day. ||||| A tornado warning has been issued in southern Mississippi as Hurricane Isaac hits Louisiana and Mississippi with high winds and drenching rains. \n \n The National Weather Service says the tornado warning area Wednesday includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport, which are west of Biloxi on Mississippi's Gulf Coast. \n \n The warning comes as Category 1 Isaac moves inland in Louisiana, bringing flooding and power outages after making landfall Tuesday evening. \n \n The U.S. National Hurricane Center warns Isaac's dangerous storm surges and flooding threats from heavy rain are expected to last all day and into the night as it crawls over Louisiana.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Today is the 7th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and for residents of Plaquemines Parish, it's deja vu all over again, according to the parish president. Billy Nungesser tells NPR that the parish, located some 95 miles from New Orleans, has already seen damage that rivals, and could even surpass, that heaped upon it by Katrina. With the levee overrun, Nungesser says parts of the parish that had escaped unscathed in previous hurricanes now sit under five feet of water. \"I don't know who's calling this a Category 1, but this is no Category 1,\" Nungesser said. \"My house has more damage than it did during Katrina.\" More on the situation in Plaquemines, and beyond: The parish's levees range from 8.5 feet to 12 feet in height. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates the storm surge hit 12.5 feet, but have yet to confirm a breach. This implies the levees, which are not part of the federal levee system, failed, reports the Times-Picayune. While the director of Plaquemines Parish's emergency preparedness says winds may have hit 110mph, CNN reports that Isaac has weakened a bit since, with maximum sustained winds of 75mph (the hurricane threshold is 74mph). As of about 10:30am ET, Isaac's center was located about 50 miles south-southwest of New Orleans. The AP reports that 500,000 are without power in the areas around New Orleans.

    "document": "The \u201csafest\u201d drug for relieving aches and pains, lowering fever and treating headaches in pregnancy may not be so safe after all, according to a new report \u2014 it may raise the risk of ADHD and similar disorders in their children. \n \n Researchers found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. \n \n They say it doesn\u2019t mean that pregnant women must never, ever take the drug, but they said women may want to avoid using it frequently until more studies have been done. \n \n \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity,\u201d said Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist at the University of California Los Angeles who worked on the study. \"You should just avoid chronic or long-term use.\u201d \n \n Infections such as influenza in pregnancy are known to affect the brain development of babies \u2014 they\u2019re linked to autism, for instance. It\u2019s one of the many reasons pregnant women are urged to get flu shots. \n \n So the researchers in this study were careful to ask women if they were taking the acetaminophen pills to reduce a fever to treat flu symptoms. Even when taking this into account, women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD. \n \n The team used an ongoing Danish study of 64,000 children and their mothers, who were called up regularly during pregnancy and asked whether they had taken any painkillers at all. \u201cAll these women were asked had they taken any pain medications and fever medications, any medications,\u201d Ritz said. \n \n \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity. \u2026 You should just avoid chronic or long-term use.\u201d \n \n About half had taken acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, Ritz\u2019s team reports Monday in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics. \n \n \u201cThey also reported what kind of disorders they had. But there are viral infections that the woman doesn\u2019t even recognize. She just feels a little malaise.\u201d That is why it is possible that it may not be the drug itself to blame, but some infection the women had, Ritz and other experts point out. \n \n It\u2019s also possible that women who feel pain more acutely, and take painkillers more often, may also have some sort of genetic predisposition that raises the risk of ADHD. \n \n The researchers were not able to make a clear estimate of risk based on dose. But women who reported ever taking the drug had a 29 percent higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD, and a 37 percent higher risk of a rarer diagnosis called hyperkinetic syndrome. \n \n Still, the findings don't show a clear cause-and-effect. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think one study alone is enough to say nobody should use acetaminophen in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Chapa of Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital, who was not involved in the study. \n \n However, there are suspicions about acetaminophen. UCLA\u2019s Dr. Jorn Olsen, who designed and led the study, had set it up because of lab studies suggesting that acetaminophen might have a hormone-like effect on the developing fetus. \n \n And it\u2019s not the first study to show something may happen in people, too. A study late last year showed that women who took acetaminophen frequently during pregnancy raised the risk of behavior problems in their children by 70 percent. \n \n \u201cPregnancy is just a very sensitive period of time where the hormones are very important to development,\u201d Ritz said. \n \n And although acetaminophen is considered a very gentle drug, it is not harmless. Large doses can damage the liver and even kill. The Food and Drug Administration has asked drug companies to limit how much they put into products. \n \n It wasn\u2019t possible to compare acetaminophen to other painkillers and fever reducers, such as ibuprofen, because pregnant women so rarely took them, Ritz said. \n \n Chapa raises another possibility. Maybe moms who favor acetaminophen for themselves also gave it to their children when they were very young and their brains were still developing. \u201cAre those moms also more likely to give acetaminophen to their children after birth?\u201d he asked. \n \n \u201cThe immediate take-home message is that if you are taking a lot, maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n Kate Langley, a neuroscientist at Britain\u2019s Cardiff University, notes that it\u2019s likely that more than one thing is going on with kids who develop ADHD. \u201cADHD is a complex disorder so it means that there are lots of different risk factors and we know a bit about some of them but we don\u2019t know a great deal,\u201d said Langley, who helped write a commentary on the findings. \u201cWe know that there are genetic and environmental and possibly prenatal (factors) but we know that none of them on their own cause ADHD.\u201d \n \n ADHD diagnoses are on the rise. More than 1 in 10 children has been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although much of this is due to awareness and not a real increase in incidence, experts say. \n \n Nonetheless, pregnant women need to weigh the risks, Ritz says. \n \n \u201cWe make these tradeoffs all the time.

I would try to avoid taking painkillers as much as I can until we know more about this.\u201d \n \n The study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from more than 64,000 children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002. Mothers in the cohort study reported on their children\u2019s behavior, and the researchers looked at databases to determine how many prescriptions for ADHD drugs were written and how many children received a diagnosis of a severe form of ADHD called hyperkinetic disorder, or HKD. \n \n The study authors concluded that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with HKD or being prescribed ADHD medications and \u201cexhibiting ADHD-like behaviors.\" It's important to note that ADHD-like behaviors are not the same as having ADHD. \n \n An accompanying editorial published in JAMA Pediatrics emphasizes that the study has found \u201can interesting observed association,\u201d but that the researchers did not find that acetaminophen causes ADHD. The study authors agree that their results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship. \n \n The data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks, Ritz says. When women reported use for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication, according to the study. \n \n Ritz says more than half of all mothers in the study reported some acetaminophen use while pregnant. The study measured how many weeks the mother reported taking any amount of acetaminophen but did not take the dosage into account. \n \n \u201cWhen used as directed, Tylenol has one of the most favorable safety profiles among over-the-counter pain relievers,\u201d said McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol. \u201cWe are aware of the recent JAMA Pediatrics study; however, there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\" \n \n The study\u2019s authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. \n \n \u201cThe cited literature is not relevant to the human condition,\u201d says Dr. Max Wiznitzer, pediatric neurologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that (women) will think, somehow, that they caused their child\u2019s problem when the study does not tell us that. It tells us that they are linked but does not tell us how.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere are a lot of variables that still need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families,\u201d Wiznitzer says. Seventy to 80% of ADHD cases are hereditary, he says. \n \n The study highlights the importance of not taking a drug\u2019s safety during pregnancy for granted, the accompanying editorial points out. \n \n \u201cThere are nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain,\u201d says Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital. Massages, baths and acupuncture are some alternatives he suggests to help relieve pain. \u201cI think we have to focus a little bit more on that as opposed to just medications.\u201d",

    "document": "Abstract CONTEXT: Swaddling is a traditional practice of wrapping infants to promote calming and sleep. Although the benefits and risks of swaddling in general have been studied, the practice in relation to sudden infant death syndrome remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct an individual-level meta-analysis of sudden infant death syndrome risk for infants swaddled for sleep. DATA SOURCES: Additional data on sleeping position and age were provided by authors of included studies. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies that measured swaddling for the last or reference sleep were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 283 articles screened, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 65.5%; P = .03), and a random effects model was therefore used for analysis. The overall age-adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) for swaddling in all 4 studies was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97\u20132.58). Removing the most recent study conducted in the United Kingdom reduced the heterogeneity (I2 = 28.2%; P = .25) and provided a pooled OR (using a fixed effects model) of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.05\u20131.80). Swaddling risk varied according to position placed for sleep; the risk was highest for prone sleeping (OR, 12.99 [95% CI, 4.14\u201340.77]), followed by side sleeping (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 2.08\u20134.81]) and supine sleeping (OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.27\u20132.93]). Limited evidence suggested swaddling risk increased with infant age and was associated with a twofold risk for infants aged >6 months. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity among the few studies available, imprecise definitions of swaddling, and difficulties controlling for further known risks make interpretation difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Current advice to avoid front or side positions for sleep especially applies to infants who are swaddled. Consideration should be given to an age after which swaddling should be discouraged. \n \n Swaddling is defined as close wrapping of an infant, usually with a light cloth and the head exposed, although swaddling styles vary across cultures. It has been reported that swaddling infants for sleep is gaining popularity in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States,1\u20133 with several reported benefits to the practice. For the general population of young infants, these include more quiet sleep,3 fewer spontaneous arousals during quiet sleep,4 and a slight reduction in excessive crying in infants aged <7 weeks.5 Further benefits are observed for specific populations, including improvements in neuromuscular development for very low birth weight infants,6 reduced physiologic and behavioral distress among premature infants,7 and improved calming and sleep for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome.8 \n \n Impaired cardiovascular control in association with a failure to arouse from sleep, leading to a reduced ability to respond to a cardiovascular stress (eg, profound hypotension), has been described as a potential mechanism leading to some sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths.9 It has also been proposed that, due to the effects of swaddling on sleep, swaddling could be used as an intervention to support supine sleep for parents who report that their infant has difficulty sleeping in this position.10 There is some evidence that infants who are swaddled and sleep supine exhibit greater heart rate responses to an auditory stimulus than infants sleeping supine nonswaddled.11 In contrast, there is evidence that swaddling may increase the risk of SIDS, as swaddled infants have fewer spontaneous arousals from sleep and increased sleep time, particularly during quiet sleep, which is a state of reduced arousability.4 In addition, those infants who were naive to swaddling (ie, not routinely swaddled) had higher induced arousal thresholds in both sleep states2 and reduced spontaneous arousability in active sleep.12 Beyond the field of SIDS, swaddling may also increase an infant\u2019s risk for developmental dysplasia of the hip (especially if not applied well),13 hyperthermia,1 pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections.14 \n \n To date, the association between swaddling and SIDS risk remains unclear, and to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive review of the literature has been performed to determine the strength of this relationship. Although health professionals and parents need this information to help make safe infant care choices, currently no official guidance exists in the United Kingdom or the United States on this topic. The purpose of the present investigation was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on this issue and quantify, through meta-analysis and using individual data when possible, whether swaddling is associated with an increased risk of SIDS. \n \n Methods Search Strategy A thorough literature search was conducted to identify studies published from the 1950s to December 2014. A comprehensive search of online databases was conducted on 3 platforms (PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid SP) and included Medline, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), CAB Abstracts, Embase, PsycINFO, BIOSIS Citation Index, SciELO Citation Index, and Web of Science Core Collection. The following search terms were used: SIDS, SUDI, SUID, swadd* (to include swaddling, swaddled, and swaddle), wrap* (to include wrapping, wrapped), and swath* (to include swathe, swathing, and swathed). Swaddling, wrapping, and swathing are used alternately and may refer to different methods of swaddling in different countries; in general, these terms are used to describe the practice of wrapping an infant in blankets or cloth. In addition, the authors conducted secondary hand-searches of reference lists of all articles found in the online database search and requested unpublished data at national and international SIDS conferences. Selection of Eligible Studies The online database search returned 389 results, and additional data from hand-searches and unpublished data (other sources) returned 15 records; after removing duplicates, this total was reduced to 283. The initial screen of titles and abstracts excluded 272 records, and the remaining 11 full-text records were assessed. Studies were excluded if they were not case-control or cohort by design, if they did not use SIDS as an outcome, or if they did not mention swaddling or infant wrapping. Articles in languages other than English had the abstract translated for screening. There were 2 studies in which it was unclear if wrapping was the same as swaddling; in both cases, the investigators were contacted to clarify the definition. Four studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in this review,15\u201318 including 1 case-control study18 in which the swaddling data were collected but remained unpublished. The screening process is detailed in Fig 1. FIGURE 1 Flowchart of study selection based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis With only 4 studies included in the review, data were extracted by hand individually from each article or source. The investigators were contacted where necessary to provide further data on postnatal age (in days) and the sleeping position (supine, side, or prone) in which swaddled and nonswaddled infants were placed (both control subjects and infants with SIDS) for their last sleep and were found. The Newcastle-Ottowa scale was used to assess study quality.19,20 Statistical Methods Descriptive statistics included median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for data that were not normally distributed. The \u03c72 test was used to compare proportional differences. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous unpaired data. The final sleep of the SIDS case subjects was compared with the reference sleep of age-matched (on an individual basis) surviving control infants for 3 of the studies and age-weighted (on a group basis) surviving control subjects for 1 study. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \u03c72 tests. Logistic regression was used to adjust the findings for age. A meta-analysis was conducted with the use of a fixed effects model and a random effects model in which heterogeneity proved significant. The latter allows for heterogeneity by assuming that the true effect varies between studies. It provides a more conservative pooled estimate reflecting the greater uncertainty when using heterogeneous data. The strength of the association between swaddling and SIDS for each study was illustrated by using a forest plot. Data were pooled and analyzed by using Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). \n \n Results Included Studies and Swaddling Prevalence A total of 4 case-control studies that examined the association between swaddling and SIDS were included in the review, and the study characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The 4 studies span 2 decades and 3 diverse areas: regions of England in the United Kingdom, Tasmania in Australia, and Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. None of the studies gave a precise definition of swaddling. Prevalence of swaddling during the different time periods varied in the 3 areas suggested by the control populations. Prevalence was highest in the study from Tasmania in the late 1980s (35.7%) and much lower in Chicago in the mid-1990s (9.2%) and England (10.3%), with a slight decrease in England 10 years later (5.7%); the number of infants included in this latter study was small (only 87 control subjects). Across the studies, 17.5% of the infants with SIDS were swaddled for the last sleep compared with 10.8% of similar-aged surviving control infants during a designated reference sleep. In all 4 included studies, the proportion of infants swaddled was higher in the SIDS cases than in the control cases; however, only in the 2 UK studies15,18 was the univariate association significant, and only in the more recent of these studies15 did this significance remain after adjustment for other factors. The assessment of study quality indicated that these were good-quality observational studies (Table 2). All 4 studies used independent case definitions and consecutive case recruitment methods. They all used community control subjects and considered comparability in the design and analysis stages. None of the studies blinded the interviewer to case or control status (although this approach would have been unethical given the outcome under study). Nonresponse differences between case and control subjects were reported in 2 of the 4 studies, and the potential for bias was raised as a limitation. TABLE 1 Study Characteristics TABLE 2 Study Quality Assessments Using the Newcastle-Ottowa Scale Pooled Results and Heterogeneity In total, 760 SIDS cases were compared with 1759 control subjects. The fixed effects model, assuming equal variance, suggests a significant pooled OR of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.18\u20131.97; P = .001). However, the prevalence of swaddling between studies was variable, and an I2 statistic of 65.5% indicated significant and substantial heterogeneity between studies (P = .03). To adjust for the heterogeneity, a random effects model was applied, yielding a pooled OR of borderline significance (1.58 [95% CI, 0.97\u20132.58]; P = .06). Looking more closely at the variance, the studies were homogeneous (I2 statistic of 28.2%; P = .25) when the most recent UK study was excluded. The pooled OR for swaddling during last sleep for the 3 remaining studies, by using a fixed effects model of analysis (shown in Table 3), provided a summary OR that remained significant (OR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.05\u20131.80]; P = .02). The forest plot for this model is shown in Fig 2. TABLE 3 Individual Univariate and Pooled ORs for Swaddling and SIDS FIGURE 2 Forest plot with 3 of 4 included studies showing the fixed effects pooled result, adjusted for infant age. aThe pooled result is illustrated by the diamond, the lateral points of which indicate the CIs for the estimate. Swaddling and Infant Postnatal Age Swaddled infants tended to be younger (median age, 57 days [IQR, 35\u201394 days], compared with 96 days [IQR, 60\u2013154 days] for nonswaddled infants in all 4 studies), although there was no significant difference (P = .23) between the age of the swaddled SIDS infants (median age, 55 days [IQR, 30\u201396 days]) and swaddled control infants (median age, 61 days [IQR, 37\u201394 days]). Figure 3 shows the age distributions of SIDS case and control infants swaddled and not swaddled. Swaddling in all groups peaked at \u223c2 months of age and dropped off steeply between 4 and 6 months of age. Although the numbers were small, the risk of SIDS from swaddling increased with age (Table 4), with the highest risk associated with infants aged \u22656 months (OR, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.21\u20135.23]). FIGURE 3 Comparison of infant age distribution among SIDS case subjects and control subjects according to swaddling status. aCategories in 4-week intervals (eg, 0\u201328 days, 29\u201356 days). TABLE 4 ORs for Infant Swaddling During Last Sleep Stratified According to Infant Age Categories Swaddling and Sleeping Position Data for position in which infants were placed for the last sleep were available from the UK and Chicago studies, whereas data for position in which infants were found were available in the UK and Tasmanian studies. In terms of position placed for the last sleep (Table 5), being swaddled and placed prone conferred the greatest risk, although this practice was rare. For both the prone and side positions, the risk doubled when the infant was also swaddled compared with nonswaddled. Notably, there was still a small but significant risk associated with infants being swaddled and placed for sleep on their backs. In terms of position found for the last sleep (Table 6), being swaddled and found sleeping prone was a rare event among the control subjects (<1%) but was more frequent among the infants with SIDS (8%).The numbers were small, but even when the lower CI was used, the risk was 19-fold. Being found on the side while swaddled was a slightly higher risk than being placed on the side without swaddling. Again, being found swaddled on the back conferred a small but significant risk compared with being found on the back nonswaddled. TABLE 5 ORs for Infant Swaddling During Last Sleep Stratified According to Position Placed for Sleep TABLE 6 ORs for Infant Swaddling During Last Sleep Stratified According to Position Found Only the 2 UK studies included data on both the sleeping position placed for the last sleep and position found. Of the 124 control infants who were swaddled, none was placed prone, those placed on their side either remained on their side (24 infants) or rolled on to their back (25 infants), and 1 control infant was placed supine and found prone. However, among the 16 swaddled infants with SIDS found prone, 3 were placed and found prone, 8 were placed on their side and found prone, and the remaining 5 were placed supine and found prone; the mean age of these 5 infants was >15 weeks (compared with 11 weeks among the other swaddled infants in these 2 studies). \n \n Discussion The present analysis combines case\u2013control data from 4 studies on the risk of SIDS for infants who were swaddled. The results from the individual-level meta-analysis revealed an age-adjusted pooled risk between swaddling and SIDS, although this finding was of borderline significance when the heterogeneity of studies was taken into account. The data extracted were limited to 4 studies from diverse regions, during different time periods, with variable prevalence rates for swaddling. The main source of heterogeneity seemed to originate from the latest study in the United Kingdom; the data for this study were collected at least 10 years after the other studies in this analysis. Although it is possible that this study is idiosyncratic, it may also indicate that interval changes in sleep practices in the United Kingdom have made the practice of swaddling more risky. Future observational studies will be needed to determine this possibility. Swaddling as a risk seemed to vary according to sleep position and older age. The significant risk of placing infants on their side or prone to sleep doubled when infants were swaddled, and the SIDS risk associated with swaddling increased with age. It has been suggested that swaddling can be used to encourage supine sleep when families are having difficulty settling younger infants in this position.27,28 Evidence regarding the effectiveness of this strategy is limited, although a survey from Oden et al10 found that the supine position for sleep was more common in infants who were routinely swaddled than in those who were swaddled occasionally. The limited evidence from the analysis in the present article does not suggest that placing younger swaddled infants supine for sleep has a protective effect against SIDS, although further studies are needed to quantify whether this practice poses any risk. It has also been postulated that swaddling could decrease the risk for SIDS by making the side position more stable.29 Our evidence suggests this outcome is the case because the risk associated with being placed in the side position almost doubled among swaddled infants. Few infants were swaddled and placed prone, although this practice was significantly more common among the infants who died, and the risk of SIDS from being placed prone doubled among the swaddled infants. We already know that being found prone is strongly associated with SIDS, but this risk also increased fourfold among the swaddled infants. The handful of swaddled SIDS infants for whom we had data suggests that the majority of those found prone either moved into this position after being placed on their side or they were older infants who rolled from the supine to the prone position. Swaddling was a more common practice among the younger infants, and the risk of SIDS linked to swaddling seemed to increase in older infants. This outcome may be related to a greater likelihood of rolling to a prone position at an older age. The advice given in the Netherlands, a country with low rates of SIDS, is to encourage swaddling to reduce excessive crying.30 Because of the likelihood of rolling to the prone position, the official advice in the Dutch guideline on excessive crying is never to initiate swaddling after the fourth month, to stop swaddling as soon as the child signals he or she is trying to turn over, and always to stop swaddling before the sixth month (after this age, infants will be able to roll over). There are several limitations to the present meta-analysis. The heterogeneity between studies was substantial, reflecting the differing swaddling practices across countries and time periods. Due to the differences in control selection, it was not possible to use conditional logistic regression, which may have increased the power of detecting the pooled estimate. The high rates of swaddling in the study from Tasmania may reflect different cultural practices at the time of that particular study. Although the quality of the studies was high, none adequately described the swaddling technique, and the questions used in each study (provided by the investigators) sometimes used the terms wrapping and swaddling synonymously, when they might indicate different infant care practices. Safer forms of swaddling in the supine position have been explored in sleep laboratory studies of young infants, especially those considering normal hip development and chest pressure concerns,27 and guidelines are more specific in some countries than others. The individual-level analysis adjusted swaddling for infant age and sleeping position but many other factors associated with SIDS were not adjusted for, in particular whether the infant was bed-sharing with the parents. Given that the most recent (albeit small) case\u2013control study included here found that swaddling was a significant risk in the multivariate analysis, future studies of SIDS risk should include a detailed assessment of swaddling to further understand this infant care practice. Future investigations of swaddling could include photographic measures of how a swaddled child was placed for sleep and found thereafter, which would improve swaddling classifications. \n \n Conclusions Despite the limitations, these analyses indicate that the current advice to avoid placing infants on their front or side to sleep may especially apply to infants who are swaddled. Given the marked increase in infants swaddled and found prone (rather than placed prone), coupled with an increased risk of swaddling with increased age regardless of sleeping position, health professionals and current guidelines should consider an appropriate age limit at which swaddling should be discouraged. ||||| Photo \n \n Swaddling a baby may increase the risk for sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, a new analysis concludes. \n \n The practice of swaddling \u2014 wrapping an infant with a light cloth, with the head exposed \u2014 has grown in the United States with reports that it promotes better sleep. \n \n Researchers pooled data from four observational studies of SIDS and swaddling that included 760 SIDS cases and 1,759 controls. \n \n Over all, swaddling increased the risk for SIDS by about one-third. The risk was greatest in babies sleeping on their stomachs, less in those sleeping on their sides, and least in infants sleeping on their backs.

Many believe it mimics what the child would feel in the womb, and it helps calm them down. \n \n SEE ALSO: Large tornado hits south of Oklahoma City, two dead \n \n \n \n The problem is if the baby moves, swaddling could make it harder for the baby to breathe when it lies on its stomach or side. \n \n \n \n A new meta-analysis compared four previous studies and found that of all the infants who died of SIDS, 17 percent had been swaddled. \n \n \n \n The risk of death doubled for children sleeping on their stomach or side when they were swaddled. \n \n \n \n Sudden death was more common among older infants, though, and the researchers think this could be because they're more likely to move from their back to their side or stomach while sleeping. \n \n \n \n For obvious ethical reasons, the researchers didn't control who was swaddled and who wasn't \u2013\u2013 which means the study is correlational, and other factors may be at play. \n \n \n \n The researchers do suggest parents stop swaddling before a child turns six months old and should place a baby on its back to sleep. \n \n More from : \n \n Knife attacker, shouting 'Allahu Akbar,' kills 1 at Munich station \n \n Medical errors are third leading cause of death in the US \n \n Eating meat contributes to climate change -- but how much?",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Parents are often told to swaddle their newborn babies in order to help them sleep, but a new analysis of studies finds that the practice may increase the risk of SIDS, the New York Times reports. Researchers looked at four studies that examined a total of 760 cases of sudden infant death syndrome, and found that swaddling (wrapping a baby tightly in a blanket in order to simulate the feeling of being in the womb, AOL reports) increased the risk for SIDS by about a third overall. Of the babies who died of SIDS, 17% were swaddled. The biggest risk was in babies asleep on their stomachs. It was less risky for those sleeping on their sides, and the least risky for those sleeping on their backs. Swaddling makes it more difficult for a baby to move, so a baby on his stomach may be more at risk if he is swaddled and his face is pushed into the mattress. The current recommendation is for parents to place babies on their backs to sleep, and the researchers say this is even more important if the baby is swaddled.

    "document": "In experiments involving a simulation of the human esophagus and stomach, researchers at MIT, the University of Sheffield, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology have demonstrated a tiny origami robot that can unfold itself from a swallowed capsule and, steered by external magnetic fields, crawl across the stomach wall to remove a swallowed button battery or patch a wound. \n \n The new work, which the researchers are presenting this week at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation, builds on a long sequence of papers on origami robots from the research group of Daniela Rus, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in MIT\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to see our small origami robots doing something with potential important applications to health care,\ufffd? says Rus, who also directs MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). \u201cFor applications inside the body, we need a small, controllable, untethered robot system. It\u2019s really difficult to control and place a robot inside the body if the robot is attached to a tether.\ufffd? \n \n Joining Rus on the paper are first author Shuhei Miyashita, who was a postdoc at CSAIL when the work was done and is now a lecturer in electronics at the University of York, in England; Steven Guitron, a graduate student in mechanical engineering; Shuguang Li, a CSAIL postdoc; Kazuhiro Yoshida of Tokyo Institute of Technology, who was visiting MIT on sabbatical when the work was done; and Dana Damian of the University of Sheffield, in England. \n \n Although the new robot is a successor to one reported at the same conference last year, the design of its body is significantly different. Like its predecessor, it can propel itself using what\u2019s called a \u201cstick-slip\ufffd? motion, in which its appendages stick to a surface through friction when it executes a move, but slip free again when its body flexes to change its weight distribution. \n \n Also like its predecessor \u2014 and like several other origami robots from the Rus group \u2014 the new robot consists of two layers of structural material sandwiching a material that shrinks when heated. A pattern of slits in the outer layers determines how the robot will fold when the middle layer contracts. \n \n Material difference \n \n The robot\u2019s envisioned use also dictated a host of structural modifications. \u201cStick-slip only works when, one, the robot is small enough and, two, the robot is stiff enough,\ufffd? says Guitron. \u201cWith the original Mylar design, it was much stiffer than the new design, which is based on a biocompatible material.\ufffd? \n \n To compensate for the biocompatible material\u2019s relative malleability, the researchers had to come up with a design that required fewer slits. At the same time, the robot\u2019s folds increase its stiffness along certain axes. \n \n But because the stomach is filled with fluids, the robot doesn\u2019t rely entirely on stick-slip motion. \u201cIn our calculation, 20 percent of forward motion is by propelling water \u2014 thrust \u2014 and 80 percent is by stick-slip motion,\ufffd? says Miyashita. \u201cIn this regard, we actively introduced and applied the concept and characteristics of the fin to the body design, which you can see in the relatively flat design.\ufffd? \n \n It also had to be possible to compress the robot enough that it could fit inside a capsule for swallowing; similarly, when the capsule dissolved, the forces acting on the robot had to be strong enough to cause it to fully unfold. Through a design process that Guitron describes as \u201cmostly trial and error,\ufffd? the researchers arrived at a rectangular robot with accordion folds perpendicular to its long axis and pinched corners that act as points of traction. \n \n In the center of one of the forward accordion folds is a permanent magnet that responds to changing magnetic fields outside the body, which control the robot\u2019s motion. The forces applied to the robot are principally rotational. A quick rotation will make it spin in place, but a slower rotation will cause it to pivot around one of its fixed feet. In the researchers\u2019 experiments, the robot uses the same magnet to pick up the button battery. \n \n Porcine precedents \n \n The researchers tested about a dozen different possibilities for the structural material before settling on the type of dried pig intestine used in sausage casings. \u201cWe spent a lot of time at Asian markets and the Chinatown market looking for materials,\ufffd? Li says. The shrinking layer is a biodegradable shrink wrap called Biolefin. \n \n To design their synthetic stomach, the researchers bought a pig stomach and tested its mechanical properties. Their model is an open cross-section of the stomach and esophagus, molded from a silicone rubber with the same mechanical profile. A mixture of water and lemon juice simulates the acidic fluids in the stomach. \n \n Every year, 3,500 swallowed button batteries are reported in the U.S. alone. Frequently, the batteries are digested normally, but if they come into prolonged contact with the tissue of the esophagus or stomach, they can cause an electric current that produces hydroxide, which burns the tissue. Miyashita employed a clever strategy to convince Rus that the removal of swallowed button batteries and the treatment of consequent wounds was a compelling application of their origami robot. \n \n \u201cShuhei bought a piece of ham, and he put the battery on the ham,\ufffd? Rus says. \u201cWithin half an hour, the battery was fully submerged in the ham. So that made me realize that, yes, this is important. If you have a battery in your body, you really want it out as soon as possible.\ufffd? \n \n \u201cThis concept is both highly creative and highly practical, and it addresses a clinical need in an elegant way,\ufffd? says Bradley Nelson, a professor of robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. \u201cIt is one of the most convincing applications of origami robots that I have seen.\ufffd? ||||| Researchers from MIT have designed a new ingestible \"robot\" that could one day be used to patch internal wounds, deliver medicine, or remove accidentally swallowed objects from the stomach. The design consists of a specially folded sheet of dried pig intestine (usually used in sausage casing) and a tiny magnet. Folded up, this capsule can be swallowed by a patient. It then hits the stomach and unfolds in the acidic juices, where it can be guided to complete certain tasks using external magnets. \n \n The design is very much a work-in-progress, but its creators think it offers a promising model for the future. Daniela Rus, the director of MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and co-creator of bot, said it could be useful in health care one day. \"For applications inside the body, we need a small, controllable, untethered robot system,\" said Rus in a press release. \"It\u2019s really difficult to control and place a robot inside the body if the robot is attached to a tether.\" \n \n The origami capsule could be used to remove swallowed batteries from the stomach \n \n It's also difficult to steer something precisely around the body using only external magnets, but Rus had a relatively simple first task for the robot: removing a swallowed battery from the stomach. MIT says that every year in the US there are more than 3,500 reports of swallowed batteries. If left in the stomach or esophagus these can burn the tissue. The researchers suggest that the origami meat robot could be deployed in these scenarios to find the magnet, pulling it free from the tissue and guiding it toward the colon for evacuation. \n \n To assess the robot's suitability for this task, the scientists bought a pig's stomach and modeled a cross-section of it using silicon. They filled the model with water and lemon juice to mimic the acidic fluids of the stomach, and carried out test runs, finding and removing a battery using their origami bot. The next step, says Rus, is to \"add sensors to the robot and redesign [it] so it's able to control itself without the need of an external magnetic field.\" Maybe they'll design a vegan version, too. ||||| Enlarge Image Melanie Gonick/MIT \n \n A pill that unfolds into a little robot could one day give parents everywhere a little more peace of mind. Once swallowed, it can open up inside a person's stomach, crawling across the stomach wall to retrieve a single-cell button battery, and even patch wounds. \n \n This is no small thing. In the US every year, over 3,500 incidents of swallowed button batteries are reported in the US, and most cases of battery swallowing involve toddlers. Although most of these batteries are safely digested, sometimes they can leak and cause tissue burns, bleeding, and death. \n \n Developed by an international team of researchers from MIT, the University of Sheffield in the UK and the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, the origami robot is the latest developed by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory director Daniela Rus, who has been building and researching origami robots for years. \n \n An ingestible robot, however, poses some significant challenges. \n \n \"For applications inside the body, we need a small, controllable, untethered robot system,\" Rus explained in a statement. \"It's really difficult to control and place a robot inside the body if the robot is attached to a tether.\" \n \n The robot has a magnet attached, and its movements are controlled using magnetic fields that are applied externally. It's constructed of two layers of structural material that maintain the robot's shape, sandwiching a layer of material made from dried pig intestine (the kind used in sausage casings) that shrinks when heat is applied. Slits in the two outer layers allow the robot to fold like a small concertina when the inner material contracts. \n \n This allows it to move along a surface a little like an inch worm. It uses what the team calls a \"stick-slip\" motion, whereby its pointed corners, designed for traction, will stick to surfaces using friction when it moves, but then slip free when the robot flexes. \n \n And, because stomachs contain liquid, the robot can swim, too. \n \n \"In our calculation, 20 percent of forward motion is by propelling water -- thrust -- and 80 percent is by stick-slip motion,\" said first author Shuhei Miyashita, formerly a postdoc at CSAIL, now a lecturer in electronics at the University of York in the UK. \n \n The team built a synthetic stomach out of silicone rubber, modelled on the mechanical properties of a pig's stomach, and filled it with a mixture of water and lemon juice to simulate stomach fluids. When deployed in this environment in a capsule made of ice that melts in the warm environment, the robot made its way to a button battery and picked it up using its attached magnet. \n \n \"It's really exciting to see our small origami robots doing something with potential important applications to health care,\" Rus said. \n \n The team will be presenting their research at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Stockholm, Sweden that runs from May 16-21.",

County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner on Wednesday will review Lohan's probation progress as part of a sentence stemming from probation in a 2007 drunk-driving conviction and a May misdemeanor theft conviction. The judge could be satisfied with Lohan's progress or set a hearing to decide whether her behavior amounts to a violation of her probation and requires she be jailed. \n \n The actress rarely appeared at a women's shelter for 350 hours of required service and never shown up at the coroner's office, where she was supposed to do another 120 hours of community service. She is now seeking to complete the women's shelter hours at the American Red Cross, according to authorities. \n \n \"She was terminated from the women's center program for failing to show up. This was one of the terms of her probation. So we will seek jail time for her,\" said Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the city attorney. \n \n Lohan was ordered in May to have her 480 hours of community service completed by April 2012. \n \n As of last week, Lohan had completed 21 of 360 hours required at the skid row shelter for women, according to law enforcement sources. Jane Robison, a district attorney's office spokeswoman, confirmed that because she failed to keep appointments at the women's center, she was transferred to the American Red Cross for those community service hours. \n \n A spokesman for the actress acknowledged last week that she transferred to the Red Cross. \n \n In a posting on her Twitter account last week, Lohan defended herself. \"I am not to be made an example of anymore. I am working hard and fulfilling my obligations every single day, to the court as well as myself,\" she wrote. \"If I travel, its for work and its been approved. As is anything I do when I leave the state. I'd appreciate it if people will just let me do what is asked of me, so that I can get my life back. Please ignore the reports which have no truth to them.

    "document": "If recent reports are to be believed, the National Security Agency has broad powers to capture private information about Americans. They know who we're calling, they have access to our Gmail messages and AOL Instant Messenger chats, and it's a safe bet that they have other interception capabilities that haven't been publicly disclosed. Indeed, most mainstream communications technologies are vulnerable to government eavesdropping. \n \n But all is not lost! The NSA's spying powers are vast, but there are still ways to thwart the agency's snooping. Here are five of them. \n \n 1. Browse anonymously with Tor \n \n NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been photographed with a Tor sticker on his laptop. Tor lets you use the Internet without revealing your IP address or other identifying information. The distributed network works by bouncing your traffic among several randomly selected proxy computers before sending it on to its real destination. Web sites will think you're coming from whichever node your traffic happens to bounce off of last, which might be on the other side of the world. \n \n Tor is easy to use. You can download the Tor Browser Bundle, a version of the Firefox browser that automatically connects to the Tor network for anonymous web browsing. \n \n 2. Keep your chats private with OTR \n \n If you use a conventional instant messaging service like those offered by Google, AOL, Yahoo or Microsoft, logs of your chats may be accessible to the NSA through the PRISM program. But a chat extension called OTR (for \"off the record\") offers \"end-to-end\" encryption. The server only sees the encrypted version of your conversations, thwarting eavesdropping. \n \n To use OTR, both you and the person you're chatting with need to use instant messaging software that supports it. I use a Mac OS X client called Adium, which works with Google, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo's chat networks, among others. Windows and Linux users can use Pidgin. OTR works as an extension to conventional instant messaging networks, seamlessly adding privacy to the IM networks you already use. You can configure Adium or Pidgin so that if a person you're chatting with is also running an OTR-capable client, it will automatically encrypt the conversation. \n \n 3. Make secure calls with Silent Circle \n \n The conventional telephone network is vulnerable to government wiretapping. And many Internet-based telephony applications, including Skype, are thought to be vulnerable to interception as well. \n \n But an Internet telephony application called Silent Circle is believed to be impervious to wiretapping, even by the NSA. Like OTR, it offers \"end-to-end\" encryption, meaning that the company running the service never has access to your unencrypted calls and can't turn them over to the feds. The client software is open source, and Chris Soghoian, the chief technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, says it has been independently audited to ensure that it doesn't contain any \"back doors.\" \n \n 4. Make secure calls with Redphone \n \n Redphone is another application that makes phone calls with end-to-end encryption. Interestingly, it was developed with financial support from U.S. taxpayers courtesy of the Open Technology Fund. \n \n The government hopes to support dissidents in repressive regimes overseas. But the only way to build a communications application that people will trust is to make it impervious to snooping by any government, including ours. So like Silent Circle, the Redphone client software is open source and has been independently audited to make sure there are no back doors. \n \n 5. Remove your cellphone battery to thwart tracking \n \n The NSA phone records program revealed by the Guardian last week not only collects information about what phone numbers we call, it also collects data about the location of the nearest cellphone tower when we make calls. That gives the NSA the ability to determine your location every time you make a phone call \u2014 and maybe in between calls too. \n \n Unfortunately, Soghoian says there's no technical fix for this kind of surveillance. \"The laws of physics will not let you hide your location from the phone company,\" he says. The phone company needs to know where you are in order to reach you when you receive a phone call. \n \n So if you don't want the NSA to know where you've been, you only have one option: You need to turn off your cell phone. Or if you're feeling extra paranoid, take out the battery or leave your phone at home. \n \n You probably can't hide metadata \n \n Soghoian says that a similar point applies to your phone calling records. Encryption technology can prevent the government from intercepting the contents of voice communications. But it's much harder to hide information about your calling patterns. And information about who you've called can be as revealing as the contents of the calls themselves. \n \n \"If you're calling an abortion clinic or a phone sex hotline or a suicide counselor, what you say is basically the same as who you're saying it to,\" Soghoian argues. \n \n Unfortunately, there's no easy technological fix for this problem. Even obtaining a phone not specifically tied to your identity may not help, as it may be possible to identify you from your calling patterns. \n \n This problem tripped up Paula Broadwell, who was outed last year as having an extra-marital relationship with Gen. David Petraeus. She had been sending e-mails from an anonymous Gmail account, and she had even been smart enough to avoid logging in from home. \n \n But the FBI identified her anyway. Broadwell logged into the account from several different hotels. The FBI obtained lists of who had checked into those hotels on the relevant dates and looked for common names. Broadwell was the only one who had checked into all of the hotels. \n \n So it's fairly easy to protect the contents of your communications from government spying. But there's no easy technological fix to prevent the government from finding out who you're communicating with. ||||| Silent Circle\u2019s products detect and prevent cyber threats aimed at mobile devices.

    "document": "Recently, the Catholic Church \u2014 and even the Pope himself \u2014 have been coming under increasing criticism for failing to appropriately discipline church officials who had sexually abused thousands of children. On March 24th, the New York Times characterized \u201cPope Benedict XVI\u2019s latest apology for the emerging global scandal of child abuse by predatory priests,\u201d as inadequate, noting that Benedict \u201c made no mention of the need to discipline diocesan leaders most responsible for shielding hundreds of priests from criminal penalties by moving them from parish to parish to continue their crimes.\u201d \n \n The Catholic League responded the op-ed by running an ad in the New York Times criticizing the paper for its editorial and blaming the scandal on homosexuality: \n \n The argument itself is confusing and contradictory. If \u201chomosexuality does not cause predatory behavior\u201d then why is is the \u201cpedophilia crisis\u201d a \u201chomosexual crisis\u201d? Most of the molesters were also over the age 30 but the Catholic League does not rename the \u201cpedophilia crisis\u201d an \u201colder man crisis\u201d or an \u201cwhite older man\u201d crisis or anything of the sort. But all this misses the point. What the Catholic League is trying to do is imply that there is a connection between homosexuality and molestation, just like segregationists once accused African Americans of raping white women, and Jews were accused of murdering Christian babies. \n \n In reality, pedophilia has little to do with the gender of the child or the orientation of the molester; pedophiles are attracted to youth and control. \u201cAccessibility is more the factor in who a pedophile abuses,\u201d psychotherapist Joe Kort writes. \u201cThis may explain the high incidence of children molested in church communities and fraternal organizations, where the pedophile may more easily have access to children.\u201d \n \n Last night on Larry King Live, Catholic League President Bill Donohue tried to dismiss this argument by claiming that \u201cit\u2019s not a pedophilia\u201d because \u201cmost of the victims were post pubescent,\u201d as old as 12 or 13 years of age. Anything older than that is the fault of gays. ||||| VATICAN CITY \u2014 A top Vatican official issued a detailed defense of Pope Benedict XVI \u2019s handling of sexual abuse cases and extensively criticized The New York Times\u2019s coverage, both in its news and editorial pages, as unfair to the pope and the church. \n \n In a rare interview and a 2,400-word statement posted Wednesday on the Vatican Web site, the official, Cardinal William J. Levada, an American who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, praised Pope Benedict for vigorously investigating and prosecuting sexual abuse cases. He said The Times\u2019s coverage had been \u201cdeficient by any reasonable standards of fairness.\u201d \n \n Cardinal Levada singled out several Times reporters and columnists for criticism, focusing particularly on an article describing failed efforts by Wisconsin church officials to persuade the Vatican to defrock a priest who had abused as many as 200 deaf boys from 1950 to 1974. The pope, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was head of the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal office when the case was referred there, in 1996. \n \n He said the article wrongly \u201cattributed the failure to accomplish this dismissal to Pope Benedict, instead of diocesan decisions at the time.\u201d On Wednesday, the archbishop of Milwaukee said the pope should not be held responsible for mistakes that were made in Wisconsin, according to The Associated Press. \n \n The Times article drew on documents obtained from lawyers suing the church that showed that Vatican officials had at first ordered a secret canonical trial, then asked the archdiocese to suspend it after the priest pleaded for leniency to Cardinal Ratzinger. Wisconsin church officials protested the suspension, but followed it. The priest, the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, died a few months later. \n \n News coverage of the abuse has clearly touched a nerve in the Vatican. As the church grapples with abuse cases that have come to light in several European countries, Benedict has come under scrutiny for how he and his subordinates handled sexual abuse allegations against priests while he served as an archbishop in Germany as well as when he was the Vatican\u2019s top doctrinal enforcer. \n \n In 1980, when the pope was archbishop of Munich and Freising, he approved the transfer of a priest who had abused boys to therapy and was copied in on a memo saying that the priest had been allowed to resume pastoral duties shortly after his therapy began. The priest was later convicted of molesting other boys. \n \n \u201cThis is different, because it\u2019s the pope and because it\u2019s a pope who is most self evidently beyond accusation, particularly in this area,\u201d said a senior Vatican official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. \n \n Cardinal Levada said he believed that \u201cthe evidence is clear\u201d that Father Murphy represented an \u201cegregious case\u201d and deserved to be defrocked. \n \n But he also said he was not second-guessing the decision to suspend the trial. He said a canonical trial would be \u201cuseless if the priest were dying.\u201d \u201cHave you ever been to a trial?

Cardinal William Levada, who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, singled out several Times reporters and columnists for criticism, focusing particularly on an article describing Wisconsin church officials' failed efforts to persuade the Vatican to defrock a priest who abused as many as 200 deaf boys from 1950 to 1974. The pope, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was head of the Vatican's doctrinal office when the case was referred there, in 1996. He said the article wrongly \u201cattributed the failure to accomplish this dismissal to Pope Benedict, instead of diocesan decisions at the time.\u201d On Wednesday, the archbishop of Milwaukee said the pope should not be held responsible for mistakes that were made in Wisconsin, according to the AP. The Times article drew on documents obtained from lawyers suing the church that showed that Vatican officials had at first ordered a secret canonical trial, then asked the archdiocese to suspend it after the priest pleaded for leniency to Cardinal Ratzinger. The priest, the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, died a few months later. \u2013 The Vatican has defended its decision to halt the sexual abuse trial of a New York priest, saying it was necessary because the man was dying. \u201cIf the man had had a miraculous recovery and doctors said he\u2019d live another 10 years, I\u2019m sure a letter would say fine, \u2018Start the trial,\u2019\u201d said Cardinal William Levada in an interview with the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the saddest and the most egregious cases I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Murphy \u201cwas a serial abuser of children, helpless children often times, he had no respect for the sacrament of confession, even using that to accomplish his abuse,\u201d Levada said. \u201cAs a believer, I have no doubt that Murphy will face the One who judges both the living and the dead.\u201d Murphy\u2019s case is different from other high-profile abuse cases because Pope Benedict is \u201cmost self evidently beyond accusation, particularly in this area,\u201d said a Vatican official.",

    "document": "Global food giant Nestle said it has found that its Thailand seafood suppliers are engaged in abusive labor practices -- a risk many companies face when sourcing from the country's fishing industry. \n \n Poor migrants seeking work in Thailand, the world's largest shrimp exporter, are being exposed to hazardous, inhumane living, and working conditions. Some are charged excessive fees, leaving them stuck in debt, in order to get jobs where they catch and process fish that ends up in Nestle's (NSRGF) supply chain, according to a report the company commissioned from Verite, a U.S.-based fair labor advocacy group. \n \n Nestle is one of the biggest food companies in the world, and owns brands such as Perrier, Purina pet food, Haagen-Dazs and Nescafe. \n \n These labor issues, however, \"are not unique or limited to the Nestle supply chain,\" the report said. \"Virtually all companies sourcing seafood in the Thai seafood sector are exposed to the same risks.\" \n \n The report found that workers were lured to work under false pretenses and often had their pay withheld and personal identification documents confiscated. Some laborers also said they were subjected to verbal and physical abuse, and were sold to boat captains needing crews for their ships. \n \n Related: CNN's Freedom Project: Seafood from slavery \n \n In August, a federal lawsuit was filed in California against grocery retailer Costco (COST), demanding that it label much of the shrimp it sells as the product of human slavery. The lawsuit also wanted Costco to stop buying shrimp from its Thailand suppliers. \n \n Thai shrimp commonly sold in the U.S. comes from farms, and the feed for the shrimp is often sourced from slave-staffed fishing boats known as \"ghost ships,\" according to the suit. Workers on those boats are kept in cages to prevent them from escaping, the suit claimed. \n \n Related: Lawsuit against Costco: Label shrimp as product of slavery \n \n Just one week after the Costco suit was filed, a class action suit was filed against Nestle alleging the company's Fancy Feast cat food -- imported from its partner, Thai Union Frozen Products -- was the product of slave labor. \n \n The workers are often trafficked from poorer neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, according to the complaint. \n \n Nestle said Monday it would work to improve the situation by finding a way to track the source of seafood ingredients, training boat captains on proper practices, and conducting audits. The company has also promised public updates periodically. \n \n \"Nestle is committed to eliminating forced labor in our seafood supply chain in Thailand, working alongside other stakeholders to tackle this serious and complex issue,\" said Nestle's Magdi Batato, executive vice president of operations, in a statement. ||||| Migrant workers toiling in Thailand\u2019s seafood industry to supply global companies such as Nestle SA are subjected to hazardous, exploitative and degrading conditions in which some fishermen are even sold to other boat captains, a report commissioned by the company found. \n \n The report conducted by Verite on behalf of Geneva-based Nestle and released Monday found \u201cindicators of forced labor, trafficking, and child labor to be present among sea-based and land-based workers.\u201d The findings, which are consistent with the non-government group\u2019s previous research on Thailand\u2019s fishing industry, \u201cpresent an urgent challenge to any company sourcing seafood.\u201d \n \n Thailand\u2019s seafood industry has come under global scrutiny in recent years following reports from media outlets such as the Associated Press, the Guardian and Global Post that showed widespread abuse of workers, mainly migrants from neighboring Cambodia and Myanmar. The mistreatment was cited by the U.S. in its annual report on human trafficking, in which Thailand fell to the lowest level, as well as in civil lawsuits filed by consumers in the U.S. accusing companies such as Nestle and Costco Wholesale Corp. of selling seafood caught using slave labor. \n \n The European Union threatened earlier this year to ban Thai seafood imports if the country fails to improve the regulation of its fishing industry. Thailand\u2019s military government has said it is working to address the concerns. \n \n In addition to the commissioned report, Nestle also released its own action plan that it said is designed to stamp out abuses in its supply chain. The plan includes setting up channels through which workers can air grievances, training for boat captains and owners, and establishing better methods of tracing raw materials and verifying labor standards. \n \n \u2018Complex Issue\u2019 \n \n \u201cNestle is committed to eliminating forced labor in our seafood supply chain in Thailand, working alongside other stakeholders to tackle this serious and complex issue,\" Magdi Batato, executive vice president of operations at the company, said in a statement. \u201cThis will be neither a quick nor an easy endeavor, but we look forward to making significant progress in the months ahead.\u201d \n \n Nestle is adopting a strategy it has applied to its chocolate business after receiving criticism about labor issues. In 2001, Nestle and other leading chocolate makers agreed to a plan to try to prevent child labor on farms in West Africa after U.S. legislators Tom Harkin and Eliot Engel highlighted the problem. Nestle agreed to monitoring by the Fair Labor Association in 2012, and the non-profit organization makes random visits to farms that supply Nestle with cocoa. \n \n Thailand\u2019s military leader Prayuth Chan-Ocha has said that it is only a few people within the industry giving the country a bad name. \n \n \u201cThose that cheat, violate the law or conduct human trafficking, these people have no place in Thai society, let alone any society,\u201d he said in his weekly television address Nov. 6, according to a transcript. \u201cWe will continue to prosecute these individuals and sustain progress on this matter.\u201d \n \n He said his government will show \u201cno leniency\u201d and is sending teams to inspect fishing vessels and docks and conduct random checks of seafood-processing plants. ||||| Fish and seafood are precious resources for our planet and all who live on it. This is particularly so for people in some of the poorest countries, who rely on healthy fisheries for their source of protein. \n \n Our fish and seafood come from a wide variety of sources, including wild fisheries in oceans around the world and from fish farms that breed their own fish. Like meat and poultry, the seafood we procure is used in ready-made and frozen meals, healthcare nutrition products such as sports drinks, and especially pet food. We purchased around 130 000 tonnes of fish and seafood in 2016, most of which is for Nestl\u00e9 Purina. \n \n How we source fish and seafood \n \n We understand the importance of having sustainable fisheries and healthy fish farms, as well as the immense challenges we all must overcome to source fish and seafood responsibly. Therefore, we work closely with our suppliers to identify, as far as possible, the sources of our fish and seafood ingredients. Our ambition is to confirm that the fish and seafood we source come from healthy fisheries or farms engaged in improvement projects. By communicating our expectations to our suppliers and following up on their progress, we will increasingly be able to assess our supply chain against our category-specific requirements for fish and seafood \u2013 for example, that there is no known sourcing from illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries and vessels, and that there is no known sourcing from operations that are not legally licensed for production and sales. We will also be able to evaluate the sustainability of seafood sources (wild and farmed) and identify projects to enhance the environmental performance of our suppliers. \n \n To best identify the origins of fish by-products, our fish and seafood buyers work closely with their vendors to collect data on the species, country of origin and fishery from where the fish originated. We provide all this seafood purchasing information to our independent, not-for-profit NGO partner \u2013 the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership ( SFP ) \u2013 to identify and assess the wild and farmed fisheries from which our seafood supply comes. \n \n Sourcing fish and seafood for pet food Identifying the precise sources for fish and seafood is difficult. For pet foods, which primarily use fish by-products, traceability is even more challenging as the typical traceability mechanisms for human edible fish do not exist. So why do we use fish by-products in our pet food? All of Nestl\u00e9 Purina\u2019s pet food products follow complete and balanced recipes that meet the nutritional needs of dogs and cats at each life stage and for many health conditions. Over 500 Nestl\u00e9 Purina pet experts are behind the creation of our recipes to provide perfectly balanced pet nutrition. Some of these recipes include the use of fish by-products, which are nutrient-dense. Fish by-products are parts of a fish that remain after the fish fillets are removed for the human food supply chain. In addition to being nutritionally beneficial, the utilisation of fish by-products represents an environmentally and socially responsible practice, by using all the protein sources of a fish while not competing with the human food supply. \n \n We are able to track about 91.7%* of our purchases of whole fish to the vessels that caught them. From there, the SFP provides assessments on the source fisheries. A large percentage of the seafood purchased for nutritious pet food products is a by-product of the process of producing fish for human consumption. Currently, we have identified 223* source fisheries, up from 153* in the previous year. Of those fisheries, 54%* were considered responsibly sourced, meaning they were low or medium risk based on Fishsource.org scores, were certified by a recognised agency such as the Marine Stewardship Council ( MSC ). \n \n Our Responsible Sourcing Guideline (pdf, 1.58Mb) ( RSG ) establishes a framework for continuous improvement in our wild caught and farmed seafood supply chain, building towards Responsible Sourcing. \n \n We also recognise seafood certified by independent NGOs such as the MSC , the world\u2019s leading certification and eco-labelling programme for sustainable seafood. \n \n Fish and seafood supply chain challenges and solutions \n \n Overfishing is a global issue within the supply chain. We are working with partners to address this and ensure sustainable practices are used. Labour conditions have also been acknowledged as an issue, in particular in the Thai seafood supply chain, and we are implementing a detailed action plan to tackle this. Fish feed has been identified by the SFP as a large challenge across the aquaculture industry, and feed manufacturers are taking steps to address this. \n \n Labour conditions \n \n Poor labour conditions has been identified as one of the issues within the fish and seafood supply chain, particular in Thailand\u2019s fishing industry. We commissioned Verit\u00e9, an independent NGO that works with companies to help understand and tackle labour issues, to investigate allegations of abuses in the Thai fishing industry. They collected information from fishing vessels, ports, mills and farms in Thailand on a range of issues, including trafficking, forced and underage labour, lack of grievance procedures, workplace conditions, and wages and benefits. Following this, we developed an action plan, based on their recommendations, to address these issues. The plan contains initiatives to protect workers from abuses. We continue to work with the Thai Government and other key stakeholders to improve labour conditions in the fish and seafood industry. \n \n Overfishing \n \n Overfishing is a key issue facing all of us. Nestl\u00e9 Purina reviews all the species caught to ensure that no critically endangered, or endangered species of fish according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List are included in our seafood purchases. \n \n Our annual objectives \n \n Fish and seafood supply chain traceability results (for whole fish; by-product is traced only by the number of fisheries) \n \n Data table Total volume in scope 130 000 tonnes Percentage of volume* of whole fish that is traceable to the boat 91.7% (2016 target: 99%) Percentage of volume* Responsibly Sourced from one of the 223 fisheries identified by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) 54% (2016 target: 40%) * The figure for total volume is Nestl\u00e9-wide and is the same as for 2015 as global volumes for 2016 have not been received. All other figures are for fish and seafood purchased by Nestl\u00e9 Purina, which receives about 92% of the total volume. \n \n Our progress to date \n \n We continue to refine our data collection methods to include more data, such as the Latin names of species, to ensure consistency across global zones. We are working with SFP to better understand aquaculture risks in different world areas and the importance of zonal management systems for fish farms. \n \n Tackling human rights abuses in the Thai seafood supply chain Following an investigation and report (pdf, 832Kb) by our independent NGO partner Verit\u00e9, we launched an action plan (pdf, 656Kb) on seafood sourced from Thailand. Focused on 10 key activities, the plan contains a series of actions designed to protect workers from abuses, improve working conditions and tackle unacceptable practices, including juvenile and teenage working. Those actions involve establishing a migrant workforce emergency response team, setting up a grievance mechanism, providing training for captains and boat owners operating in the industry, raising awareness about minimum required labour standards, establishing better traceability of raw materials and enabling verification of labour standards in fishing vessels. The action plan was rolled out throughout 2016, with a dedicated manager based in Thailand to oversee its implementation. Alongside the Thai Government, local seafood suppliers and international buyers, we also continue to participate in the multi-stakeholder ILO Working Group, which is seeking collaborative solutions to improve labour conditions in Thailand\u2019s complex seafood export industry. \n \n Looking ahead \n \n Human rights abuses have no place in our seafood supply chain. Nestl\u00e9 was among the first companies to issue a comprehensive plan to work with NGO partners to address this complex issue. As part of this effort to fight human rights abuses in the seafood supply chain, Nestl\u00e9 bans all fish and seafood caught from IUU (Illegal, Unregulated, Unreported) fishing. To demonstrate further our commitment to fighting human rights abuses, Nestl\u00e9 Purina committed to a ban on all trans-shipments at sea (where items are transferred from one ship to another) at the end of 2016, and we are updating our RSG to include this prohibition. Trans-shipments at sea enable rogue fishing vessels to engage in IUU fishing and other illegal activities by not returning to port for extended periods of time, up to several years in some cases. We believe the worst forms of human rights abuses may occur aboard such vessels because of the lack of regulation, enforcement and transparency offshore. Due to the opaque nature of offshore fishing practices and worker treatment on vessels, Nestl\u00e9 Purina supports banning all trans-shipments as a step towards eliminating IUU fishing and preventing human rights abuses at sea.",

Some toil for over a year before getting paid, while others are charged fees that leave them in debt. Nestle\u2014which is facing a lawsuit claiming its Fancy Feast cat food comes from slave labor\u2014acknowledges that seafood caught under these conditions ends up in its supply chain. But \"virtually all companies sourcing seafood in the Thai seafood sector are exposed to the same risks,\" it says.

A new report commissioned by the company finds \"indicators of forced labor, trafficking, and child labor to be present among sea-based and land-based workers,\" Bloomberg reports. The workers are often trafficked from poorer neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, according to the complaint. Nestle said Monday it would work to improve the situation by finding a way to track the source of seafood ingredients, training boat captains on proper practices, and conducting audits. \"Nestle is committed to eliminating forced labor in our seafood supply chain in Thailand, working alongside other stakeholders to tackle this serious and complex issue,\" the company's executive vice president of operations said in a statement. \"This will be neither a quick nor an easy endeavor, but we look forward to making significant progress in the months ahead.\" Nestle is adopting a strategy it has applied to its chocolate business after receiving criticism about labor issues. In 2001, Nestle and other leading chocolate makers agreed to a plan to try to prevent child labor on farms in West Africa after US legislators Tom Harkin and Eliot Engel highlighted the problem. The plan includes setting up channels through which workers can air grievances, training for boat captains and owners, and establishing better methods of \u2013 Thai military leader Prayuth Chan-Ocha says only a few people in the country's seafood industry are guilty of human trafficking and \"cheat, violate the law, or conduct human trafficking,\" and his government will prosecute them, the BBC reports. \"We will continue to prosecute these individuals and sustain progress on this matter,\" he said in his weekly television address Sunday, per a transcript obtained by the BBC. Thai authorities are sending teams to inspect fishing vessels and docks and conduct random checks of seafood-processing plants, according to the transcript. The military has been running Thailand since a 2014 coup, and it's not the first time the country has been caught up in corruption and human trafficking in the seafood industry. Last year, for instance, a Thai businessman was sentenced to 20 years in prison after he was found to have bought fish and seafood labeled as coming from \"illegal, unreported, and unregulated\" fisheries, the New York Times reported at the time. In a statement, Nestle Purina, one of the world's largest pet food companies, said it uses fish by-products in its pet food because they are \"nutrient-dense\" and \"beneath the nutritional needs of dogs and cats at each life stage and for many health conditions.\" The \u2013 Nestle is the world's biggest food company, but it's not exactly squeaky-clean when it comes to how it buys its fish and seafood. The company released its annual report on responsible sourcing Tuesday, and it found that 40% of the seafood it buys comes from sources that use slave labor, Reuters reports. The report was based on an investigation by Verit\u00e9, an independent NGO, that surveyed factories, ports, and fishing boats in Thailand on issues including trafficking, forced and underage labor, and poor working conditions. \"We continue to work with the Thai Government and other key stakeholders to improve labor conditions in the seafood industry,\" Nestle said in a statement, adding that it has taken steps to address the issues, including setting up an emergency response team to deal with complaints and setting up a grievance mechanism.

    "document": "HONG KONG \u2014 Every June, millions of high school seniors in China sit down for a grueling university entrance exam, knowing they may not get into a top school or any school at all. If their results are disappointing, finding another route to university can take a year or more. \n \n Now they may have a faster option. \n \n The University of New Hampshire says it will start accepting scores from the Chinese exam, making it the first flagship state school in the United States to evaluate Chinese applicants using the results from that test, known as the gaokao. \n \n There are 377,000 Chinese students in the United States, representing more than one third of all international students, according to the federal government. Since they often pay full tuition, they are an important source of revenue for American universities, which have been intensifying their efforts to recruit Chinese students. \n \n Erika Mantz, a spokeswoman for the University of New Hampshire, said the gaokao program was meant to attract \u201coutstanding Chinese high school graduates\u201d after they get their test results in late June, months after the deadline has passed under the regular admissions process. Most incoming freshmen would have been admitted by the time Chinese students take the gaokao test. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nearly 10 million people took the Gaokao exam in China last week \n \n A US university will begin accepting the Chinese university entrance exam known as the Gaokao in an effort to attract more Chinese students. \n \n The University of New Hampshire will be the first state university in the US to accept the standardised placement test. \n \n China is the largest exporter of students to the US, with 377,000 currently enrolled in US universities, according to government data. \n \n An estimated 10 million students took the nine-hour test in China last week. \n \n The exam - which takes place over two days in June each year - is taken by nearly every Chinese pupil and plays a crucial role in determining a person's career and future prospects. \n \n A 'life-defining' test \n \n Howard Zhang, BBC Chinese Service Editor \n \n Gaokao literally means High Exam. It refers to the annual National Higher Education Entrance Exam in China, similar in format to the SAT in the United States. \n \n Millions of Chinese high school seniors who sit through this highly competitive multi-subject exams each year see it as a life-defining moment. \n \n Graduates who make it into top universities often end up in top companies and with good careers. Those who fail to enter university are often condemned to a life with little prospects. \n \n Almost 10 million students sat through this year's Gaokao; one out of four won't end up with a university place. \n \n The Gaokao predates modern times, having its roots in imperial China. \n \n The University of New Hampshire had 781 international undergraduate and graduate students on campus last fall, according to the Union Leader newspaper - double the figure from five years previous. \n \n About half of those foreign students - 357 - came from China. \n \n As part of the new initiative, the university has launched a recruiting website in Chinese and English. \n \n \"This initiative is part of UNH's commitment to attracting more and stronger applicants from around the world,\" said university spokeswoman Erika Mantz. \n \n \"This new programme will in no way limit access for New Hampshire students,\" she added. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption The students see huge public support during the Gaokao season - here some are being cheered on their way to sit the tests in Anhui \n \n In addition to submitting their Gaokao results, students must also take an English test, participate in a video interview and send their high school transcripts before moving forward with the application process. \n \n Ms Mantz added that the process was still being finalised, but that Chinese students may still need to take the American SAT or ACT exam. \n \n Students who are accepted will be able to begin classes in Durham this January, allowing them to start a semester early. \n \n Previously, students from China would have had to wait for a new application period to begin in the autumn, putting them behind the rest of the first-year class. \n \n A similar programme at the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit college, allows Chinese students to bypass US standardised tests altogether and instead submit just their Gaokao score, grades, and English language interview. \n \n Image copyright BBC/ Gaokao Image caption A maths question on the 2014 exam asks: \"If A= {}, and B={}, then A I B = ( )\" \n \n Up to three percent of Chinese students bypass the Gaokao by paying to for an \"international track\" programme, which prepares them for standardised testing abroad. \n \n International enrolment - in which students are required to pay full priced tuition - helps universities bolster revenue. \n \n The University of New Hampshire charges $45,000 (\u00a334,000) per academic year for tuition and housing costs. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chinese students explain why they came to the US - and how college life differs to home \n \n Dozens of universities in Europe, Australia, and Canada already accept Gaokao results on applications. \n \n The US university's decision comes amid a federal crackdown on Chinese student visas. \n \n The Trump administration announced in March that it is considering limiting the visas as part of a broad package of measures against China, which the US accuses of violating American intellectual-property laws. \n \n The goal, the White House says, is to reduce \"economic theft by non-traditional intelligence collectors\". \n \n Details have not been officially announced, but students studying high tech manufacturing fields, such as aviation and robotics, are expected to now receive visas with shorter lengths of stay. \n \n The Associated Press reported in late May that US consulates have been directed by the Department of State to now only issue Chinese students with one-year - rather than five-year - visas. ||||| Our Innovative Gaokao-based, Early Admission Program For Superlative Chinese Students \n \n The University of San Francisco is pleased to announce that we are now accepting applications for our Admission By Gaokao Examination Program for the Fall 2018 Semester. \n \n We started this innovative program to enable Chinese students who score well on the Gaokao taken in June to study in the United States as early as the coming Fall Semester (August 2018). \n \n Students will be admitted to USF based on their Gaokao test scores, school record and a one-on-one English interview with USF Professors Via Zoom. There are no other admission requirements. \n \n USF President Paul J. Fitzgerald, S.J. explained: \n \n Many studies have shown that the SAT is not a very good predictor of how well students will do at university. We are aware of the many criticisms that have been made of the Gaokao, but it has the advantage of being what educational experts call a 'criterion-referenced' exam: It tests whether students are able to master a given body of knowledge, as well as their ability to work hard and consistently. \n \n USF recognizes this and wants to give excellent Chinese students the opportunity to start their education in the USA, immediately\u2014without spending an extra year preparing for IELTS, TOEFL or SAT tests. \n \n Eligible student scores will be established after Gaokao results become available in the third week of June. The interviews will begin July 2 (Monday) and will be held via Zoom. \n \n Successful candidates will be able to start their studies in America as soon as August of this year. \n \n The admission process will be streamlined so that qualified students will receive formal admission letters within days of their successful personal interviews, enabling them to schedule visa appointments. This will allow them to arrive in time for the beginning of classes on Tuesday, August 21. \n \n Unfortunately, space is limited.

Now, the University of New Hampshire plans to cull some of that talent. The school has announced that it will accept scores from the Chinese exam on entrance applications, making it the first \"flagship\" state school in the US to do so. But submitting the gaokao results will not be the only test criteria. Students will also be required to take an English test, participate in a video interview and send their high school transcripts, reports the BBC, and they may still need to take the SAT or ACT exam. If admitted they would pay out-of-state tuition and housing costs of more than $45,000 a year. A few private institutions in the US as well as dozens of universities in Europe, Australia, and Canada already accept gaokao results on applications. The University of San Francisco has an early admissions program that allows June test takers to enroll in the fall semester, based on their grades, gaokao score, and personal interview in English. Not everyone is a fan of the gaokao. Critics say the test emphasizes memorization over creativity, but University of San Francisco president Paul J.

If their results are disappointing, finding another route to university can take a year or more. Now they may have a faster option. The University of New Hampshire says it will start accepting scores from the Chinese exam, making it the first flagship state school in the US to evaluate Chinese applicants using the results from that test, known as the gaokao, the New York Times reports.

The UNH rep says the school hopes to attract \"outstanding Chinese high school graduates\" who would have been admitted by now if they had followed the usual admissions process, the New York Times reports. \"This initiative is part of UNH's commitment to attracting more and stronger applicants from around the world,\" the rep says, adding that Chinese students may still need to take the American SAT or ACT. \u2013 The University of New Hampshire has become the first US university to accept results from the Gaokao test, China's version of the SAT, the BBC reports.

Fitzgerald said in a statement. \"We are aware of the many criticisms that have been made of theGaokao, but it has the advantage of being what educational experts call a 'criterion-referenced exam.'

    "document": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, had his White House security clearance restored Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said, after months of uncertainty stemming in part from his role in the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. \n \n Kushner met with Mueller's investigators a second time in April and answered questions for seven hours, according to his attorney, Abbe Lowell. He had previously sat for an interview last November that was largely focused on former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who soon after pleaded guilty to charges of making false statements to the FBI. \n \n These developments come as the Mueller's investigators appear to be trying to complete parts of their inquiry. \n \n The Kushner team believes he is now finished with all ongoing inquiries, which also include the investigations by congressional committees, according to a person close to Kushner. \n \n A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. \n \n \"A year ago, Jared was one of the first to voluntarily cooperate with any investigation into the 2016 campaign and related topics,\" Lowell said in a statement. \n \n \"Since then, he has continued this complete cooperation, providing a large number of documents and sitting for hours of interviews with congressional committees and providing numerous documents and sitting for two interviews with the Office of Special Counsel. On each occasion, he answered all questions asked and did everything he could to expedite the conclusion of all the investigations.\" \n \n Kushner was stripped of his interim clearance in February amid an overhaul of procedures governing access to the nation's most sensitive secrets following the resignation of Rob Porter, the President's staff secretary, who had been allowed to remain in his post for months despite allegations of spouse abuse. \n \n The Mueller probe has also hung over Kushner's status in the White House, in part because some of the matters under investigation relate to his role during the campaign and the transition, including contacts with Russians, as well as events that occurred in the early months of the Trump presidency, such as the firing of former FBI Director James Comey \n \n JUST WATCHED What you need to know about Jared Kushner Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What you need to know about Jared Kushner 01:24 \n \n White House officials have blamed the delay in Kushner receiving his security clearance on administrative backlogs normal to a new administration, as well as the complicated nature of his application. But Kushner's troubles were compounded at least in part because his initial security clearance application didn't list dozens of foreign contacts that he later included in updated submissions to the FBI. \n \n Lowell disputed that the initial security clearance application played any role in the delay in Kushner receiving his final clearance. \n \n \"With respect with the news of his clearance being restored, as we stated before, his application was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and went through the normal process,\" Lowell said. \"Throughout the process, Mr. Kushner has continued to work on a number of foreign policy and domestic issues with no interruption. Having completed all of these processes, he is looking to continue to do the work the President has asked him to do.\" ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been granted his permanent security clearance, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, ending a period of uncertainty that had fueled questions about whether Mr. Kushner was in peril in the special counsel investigation. \n \n Mr. Kushner is a senior presidential aide with a prominent role in Middle East diplomacy. But his F.B.I. background checks dragged on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the White House. Even some inside the administration suspected that Mr. Kushner\u2019s delay reflected legal problems on the horizon. \n \n The permanent clearances make Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, eligible to view some of the United States\u2019 most closely guarded secrets, including the daily intelligence briefing that Mr. Trump receives and the delicate intelligence on the Israelis and the Palestinians that former diplomats said can be valuable in negotiations. Top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level White House meetings. \n \n White House officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts. But with the special counsel investigating some of Mr. Kushner\u2019s meetings with Russian officials, it left open the question of whether investigators had uncovered evidence that made him a security threat.",

But his FBI background checks dragged on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the White House.

Top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level White House meetings. White House officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts. But with the special prosecutor investigating some of Mr. Kushner\u2019s meetings with Russian officials, it left open the question of whether investigators had uncovered evidence that made him a security threat.",

Some believe the deformity has to do with agriculture and industrial run-off that finds its way to the river. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n For male smallmouth bass, sex change is increasingly not an option. In the chemical-laced Chesapeake Bay watershed and in rivers up through New England, it comes with the territory. \n \n Based on the latest U.S. Geological Survey on intersex fish, 85 percent of male smallmouth bass in waters in and around national wildlife refuges in the Northeast have developed \"characteristics of the opposite sex.\" That's in addition to 90 percent of the species in some West Virginia waters and 50 percent to 100 percent in the southern stretch of the Potomac River. All of the affected fish had eggs where their testes should be, according to previous studies. \n \n [One of Europe\u2019s oldest trees is changing its sex] \n \n Why this is happening remains a mystery, says the lead author of a new study, despite the problem being detected more than a decade ago. \u201cIt is not clear what the specific cause of intersex is in these fish,\u201d said Luke Iwanowicz, a USGS research biologist. \u201cThis study was designed to identify locations that may warrant further investigation.\" \n \n The strongest suspicion focuses on what is poured down the drains of homes, businesses and farms every day. Scientists are worried that prescription drugs such as birth control and mood-control pharmaceuticals, flushed down toilets, and chemical pesticides such as atrazine, washed off farms by rain, have turned creeks, streams and rivers into chemical soups that disrupt the endocrines of marine life. \n \n [How birth control pills are also altering the sex lives of fish] \n \n These substances throw off functions that regulate hormones and the reproductive system, said USGS biologist Vicki Blazer, a co-author of the latest study and lead author of numerous earlier reports. At one polluted site Blazer examined in the Susquehanna River near Hershey, Pa., two years ago, 100 percent of the male smallmouth bass sampled had eggs. \n \n The surprising thing found in the most recent survey, Iwanowicz said, is that the bass are being sexually transformed in more pristine waters at national wildlife refuges managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency's 560 refuges -- 71 in the Northeast -- provide a sanctuary for 1,000 fish species, 700 bird species and about 200 species of mammals. \n \n Smallmouth bass are \"like the canary in the coal mine,\" Iwanowicz said. \"In the case of this specific study, we\u2019re getting a better handle on how widespread [the problem] is. We\u2019re seeing this signal at national wildlife refuges, \u2026 evidence that in areas that are managed for animal health, stuff is going on behind the scenes.\" \n \n \n \n A magnification of a cross-section view of a smallmouth bass' testes that shows immature eggs, which are round circles on the monitor. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n Among the 19 refuges included in the study were Blackwater and Patuxent in Maryland, Mason Neck and Rappahannock River Valley in Virginia, Great Swamp in New Jersey, Cherry Valley in Pennsylvania and Moosehorn in Maine. \n \n \"These effects have been observed in other organisms, including mammals,\" said Don Tillitt, another co-author who is a research toxicologist at the USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center in Missouri. \"The mechanism occurs in the epi-genome, around the genome. Not the genes, but how those genes are expressed.\" \n \n A USGS study released in March found that male fish exposed to a synthetic hormone called 17a-ethinylestradiol, or EE2, produced offspring that struggled to fertilize eggs. And their grandchildren suffered a 30 percent decrease in their fertilization rate. \n \n [Here's how the chemical industry blocks science that could determine why fish are changing sex] \n \n The problem extends well beyond the Chesapeake Bay region that includes the District, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, New York and Pennsylvania. The USGS, which found intersex bass in the Columbia, Colorado and Mississippi river basins in 2009, calls it a \"global issue\" given changes that have been identified in locations worldwide. \n \n The previous study also determined that the chemical BPA, used widely in plastics, had a similar effect on the small Japanese medaka fish. Marine scientists track the medaka because it reproduces so quickly that researchers can see results of subsequent generations faster than slow-reproducing species such as smallmouth bass. \n \n Intersex changes in male fish have been recorded in 37 species so far, though scientists have yet to identify a single chemical responsible for the transformation. \n \n Read More: \n \n Sex changes in snails might be triggered by a simple touch \n \n Brains aren\u2019t actually \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female,\u2019 new study suggests \n \n Scientists examine why men even exist \n \n Wired to cheat: why these \u2018monogamous\u2019 rats keep fooling around \n \n The loudest male howler monkeys are compensating for small, well, you know \n \n A \u2018supergene\u2019 turns these male birds into female impersonators or sneaky mate thieves \u2014 for life ||||| Eighty five percent of male smallmouth bass and 27 percent of male largemouth bass tested in waters in or near 19 National Wildlife Refuges in the Northeast U.S. were intersex, according to a new study by U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service researchers. Intersex is when one sex develops characteristics of the opposite sex. It is tied to the exposure of fish to endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can affect the reproductive system and cause the development of characteristics of the opposite sex, such as immature eggs in the testes of male fish. Intersex is a global issue, as wild-caught fish affected by endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been found in locations across the world. Estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals are derived from a variety of sources, from natural estrogens to synthetic pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals that enter the waterways. Examples include some types of birth control pills, natural sex hormones in livestock manures, herbicides and pesticides. \u201cIt is not clear what the specific cause of intersex is in these fish,\u201d said Luke Iwanowicz, a USGS research biologist and lead author of the paper. \u201cThis study was designed to identify locations that may warrant further investigation. Chemical analyses of fish or water samples at collection sites were not conducted, so we cannot attribute the observation of intersex to specific, known estrogenic endocrine\u2014disrupting chemicals.\u201d This prevalence of intersex fish in this study is much higher than that found in a similar USGS study that evaluated intersex in black basses in nine river basins in the United States. That study did not include river basins in the Northeast. \"The results of this new study show the extent of endocrine disrupting chemicals on refuge lands using bass as an indicator for exposures that may affect fish and other aquatic species,\" said Fred Pinkney, a USFWS contaminants biologist and study coauthor. \"To help address this issue, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service encourages management actions that reduce runoff into streams, ponds and lakes -- both on and off of refuge lands.\u201d The journal article, Evidence of estrogenic endocrine disruption in smallmouth and largemouth bass inhabiting Northeast U.S. National Wildlife Refuge waters: a reconnaissance study,\u201d by L.R.

Sperry is available online in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety. ||||| A strange thing is happening to male smallmouth and largemouth bass swimming in waterways in parts of the Northeast: They are increasingly showing up with characteristics of the opposite sex. \n \n In a survey of 19 national wildlife preserves, researchers from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service found this month that a whopping 85 percent of smallmouth bass and 27 percent of male largemouth bass were intersex. \n \n \"What we're finding is the presence of immature eggs in the gonads of the male fish,\" said Luke Iwanowicz, a USGS research biologist. \"This has basically been an indication of exposure of estrogens such as compounds that enforce the female physiology.\" \n \n Iwanowicz is the lead author of a paper on the phenomenon, which has been published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety. \n \n Fish are often used as indicators of aquatic health, and in this case, are being used to showcase the increasing threat of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which are being dumped into our rivers, streams, swamps, and lakes. Among the main culprits are hormones in livestock manure and herbicides and pesticides found in runoff. Trace amounts of pharmaceuticals, like birth control pills, are also showing up in waterways after being discharged from wastewater treatment plants. \n \n \"Estrogens are hormone signaling molecules that work in low concentrations,\" Iwanowicz said of the chemicals, which are found mostly in the organs of the fish, rather than the flesh that people eat. \n \n \"The low concentrations of these hormones can have potentially profound effects,\" he said. \"We are looking at fish but, of course, there is that concern that, if this stuff is in the water, it can be affecting other wildlife.\" \n \n He added, \"We're not sure how it works into the human dimension but it's kind of worth considering.\" \n \n Related: Scientists Want To See Microbeads Banned \u2014 And California Is Leading The Way \n \n In conducting the study, Iwanowicz and his colleagues did not conduct a chemical analysis on the water so they could not say for sure what was to blame for the intersex fish. But the findings suggest that EDCs were the most likely the culprit. \n \n The problem of intersex fish has been documented over the past two decades in nearly 40 fish species worldwide. Scientists believe their prevalence is more widespread than previously thought and could be starting to take a toll on some populations, either by reducing a fish's ability to reproduce or weakening its immune system and making them more vulnerable to disease. \n \n \"Estrogenic exposure is a problem throughout the developed world and there are many instances in which fish population health was degraded through the presence of estrogenic compounds,\" said Heiko L. Schoenfuss, director of the Aquatic Toxicology Laboratory at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota. \n \n \"Although estrogens by themselves seldom reach environmental concentrations that would result in the collapse of a fish population, they are an important and potent environmental stressor that may impeded the recovery of aquatic ecosystems that have experienced other sources of disturbances,\" he said. \n \n A 2009 study by the USGS examined 16 fish species from 1995 to 2004 and found a third of all male smallmouth bass and a fifth of all male largemouth bass were intersex. Intersex fish were found in a third of all sites examined from the Apalachicola, Colorado, Columbia, Mobile, Mississippi, Pee Dee, Rio Grande, Savannah, and Yukon River basins. \n \n John Arway, executive director of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, said the most recent findings reflect what has been found in the state's waters. A USGS study last year found intersex fish in Pennsylvania's Susquehanna, Delaware, and Ohio River basins. Four of the wildlife refuges in the latest study are at least partly located in the state. \n \n \"Obviously we're concerned not only about the Susquehanna, but the other waters that either drain into or drain out of those national wildlife refuges,\" Arway said. \n \n Related: California's Fishing Industry Feels the Pinch From Toxic Crabs \n \n Arway said his agency, along with the US Environmental Protection Agency, found that until 2005 there were no reports of disease among smallmouth bass on the Susquehanna River. Since then, sampling in some sites has revealed disease rates of up to 70 percent. \n \n \"One of the things found was that EDCs and herbicides were the likely and probable causes for the effects we are seeing with our bass on the Susquehanna,\" he said, adding that there has been increased incidences of sores and lesions on the fish, as well as cancerous tumors. \n \n \"[W]e are seeing the population of fishable bass declining on the Susquehanna,\" he said. \"That is not to say EDCs are the only stressor that are effecting these young fish but we are starting to narrow down the causes and EDCs are the likely cause that is infecting and killing these young fish.\" \n \n Combating the problem won't be easy, since estrogen is so widespread \u2014 all living things produce it, after all \u2014 and its effects are often felt at very low concentrations. Fixes like upgrades to treatment plants, would be costly and limiting the use of herbicides and pesticides or controlling runoff from farms faces opposition from the agricultural industry. \n \n \"We need to start acting on some of the chemicals we know cause these effects and not worry about those we can't control like a lot of the antibiotics,\" Arway said. \"We need to trace those concentrations back up the tributaries, find out the major sources of where these chemicals are being applied and then work with the applicators \u2014 whether it's the farmers or the lawn care companies \u2014 to try to get them to adhere to the label restrictions.\" \n \n Follow Michael Casey on Twitter: @Mcasey1 \n \n Image via Flickr",

Officials have not released the names of the victims. ||||| UPDATE: Colts Neck fatal fire mystery deepens as brother is charged with setting his own house ablaze \n \n Keith Caneiro grew up in Brooklyn and was the best man in his brother's wedding. \n \n Caneiro, whom a source says was found dead outside his Colts Neck mansion on Tuesday, was the owner of a technology firm and a pest control company in Asbury Park, according to public records and social media. He also dabbled in real estate. \n \n Caneiro, 50, his wife Jennifer Caneiro, 45, and two of their children died in an apparent quadruple homicide at the family's sprawling estate on Willow Brook Road, discovered after a fire swept through the home, a law enforcement source told NJ Advance Media \n \n The source said that Keith Caneiro, who was found on the home's front lawn, had suffered a gunshot wound that did not appear to be self-inflicted. \n \n Keith Caneiro is listed as the owner of both the technology firm, Square One, and EcoStar Pest Management in Asbury Park, working both businesses with his brother. \n \n He had operated Square One, in Asbury Park since 1987, according to his LinkedIn profile. \n \n Records show Caneiro also has an active real estate license. A professional real estate website registered with his name as the web address advertises an affiliation with Keller Williams Realty. \n \n Jennifer Caneiro grew up on Staten Island as Jennifer Karidis, her maiden name, records show. \n \n Photos of the Caneiros on Facebook show a happy family playing in the kitchen, relaxing with loved ones and enjoying trips overseas. \n \n Caneiro's brother, Paul Caneiro, of Ocean Township, is involved in both the technology firm and the pest control operation, according to Jared DeVincenzo, who works in the building which houses both businesses. The pair grew up in Brooklyn before both marrying women from Staten Island and moving to New Jersey. \n \n Paul Caneiro's home on Tilton Drive was also the scene of a fire Tuesday morning, one that is now also under investigation by the prosecutor's office for possible links to the Colts Neck fire. \n \n Whether the two fires are related \"remains to be seen,\" Gramiccioni told reporters. \n \n Neighbors told NJ Advance Media Paul Caneiro appeared visibly distressed, with \"tears in his eyes,\" after the fire broke out before dawn at his house. \n \n Neighbors said he stayed at the scene until about noon. He and his wife had not returned home as of Tuesday evening. \n \n Neighbors described the Ocean Township couple, who have two older children, as friendly and helpful, and said Paul Caneiro had been injured in a car accident in Asbury Park a few years ago. \n \n When Paul Caneiro married his wife Susan in 1991, his brother Keith served as his best man, in a wedding officiated by the mayor of Shrewsbury, according to the couple's wedding announcement in the Staten Island Advance. \n \n Keith Caneiro's LinkedIn profile says he graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor's degree in 2014, and was either enrolled or recently completed a master's program at the university. \n \n Both his LinkedIn profile and Facebook page also indicate he had taken courses at Harvard Business School. \n \n He graduated from John Dewey High School in Gravesend, Brooklyn. \n \n Caneiro purchased the family's home on Willow Brook Road in 1999, according to Monmouth County property records. He and his wife paid off the $1.8 million mortgage two years ago. \n \n Prosecutor's office officials indicate they expect to release more information Wednesday. \n \n Sophie Nieto-Munoz contributed to this report. \n \n Thomas Moriarty may be reached at tmoriarty@njadvancemedia.com.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A convoluted story out of New Jersey, where police have charged Paul Caneiro with aggravated arson in connection with a fire at his own home\u2014one that the Asbury Park Press reports occurred seven hours before a fatal fire at his brother's mansion. Around 5am Tuesday, firefighters responded to Paul Caneiro's Ocean Township home and put out flames on the roof. Around 12:30pm, fire broke out at brother Keith Caneiro's home 12 miles away in Colts Neck, where police say a quadruple homicide occurred: Keith Caneiro, 50\u2014found on the front lawn with a gunshot wound that didn't appear to be self-inflicted, per NJ.com\u2014died along with his wife, 45-year-old Jennifer Caneiro, and their son and daughter, who were found inside, a law enforcement source tells the Asbury Park Press. The New York Times describes both children as under the age of 10. The brothers appear to have been close. Born in Brooklyn, they shared a Staten Island address for more than a decade before moving to New Jersey with their wives, per NJ.com. They would take up separate abodes: Paul in a single-family home on Tilton Drive in suburban Ocean Township, Keith in a $1.5 million mansion in upscale Colts Neck, home to celebrities like Bruce Springsteen. But Paul would still work for Keith\u2014 owner of EcoStar Pest Management and apparent web development company Square One\u2014who also served as his best man. \"They're wonderful people,\" says a neighbor of Paul, who saw family members Tuesday outside the house believed to have suffered damage to its back and attic, per the Times. \"It's pretty shocking stuff.\" An earlier version of this story erroneously reported Paul Caneiro as being charged in the Colts Neck fire.

    "document": "So my brother comes home the other day,\" Taylor Swift says, \"and he goes, 'Oh, my God \u2013 I just saw a guy walking down the street with a cat on his head.'\" \n \n As an ardent fan of ready-made metaphors, as well as of cats, Swift was excited by this. \"My first reaction was, 'Did you take a picture?'\" she says. \"And then I thought about it. Half of my brain was going, 'We should be able to take a picture if we want to. That guy is asking for it \u2013 he's got a cat on his head!' But the other half was going, 'What if he just wants to walk around with a cat on his head, and not have his picture taken all day?'\" \n \n Related PHOTOS: The Taylor Swift Guide to 1989: Breakers Gonna Break, Fakers Gonna Fake From the Bangles to Billy Joel, the boldest, weirdest genre-crossing jams from Taylor's inspirational year \n \n For Swift \u2013 four-time multiplatinum-album-maker, seven-time Grammy winner and billion-time gossip-blog subject \u2013 being famous is a lot like walking around with a cat on your head. \"I can have issues with it,\" she says. \"But at the end of the day, I can't be ungrateful, because I chose this. But sometimes \u2013 sometimes \u2013 you don't want to have a camera pointed at you. Sometimes it would be nice if someone just said, 'Hey, I think it's really cool that you have that cat on your head. I think that's interesting.'\" \n \n It's 1300 hours in the San Fernando Valley, and Project Sparrow is in full effect. In a nondescript parking lot at a soundstage in Van Nuys, California, a Blackwater-esque platoon of personal-security professionals stands at the ready. Every doorway and stairwell is guarded, and every window is blacked out. The occasion: a Taylor Swift video shoot. \n \n Theo Wenner \n \n In 2014, a Swift shoot requires the kind of operational secrecy and logistical complexity rarely seen outside of a SEAL raid. Before Project Sparrow \u2013 the code name chosen by the video's director, Mark Romanek \u2013 there was Project Cardinal, a multiweek mission where Swift's social-media team scoured the Web for a representative group of fans to appear in the video. When one girl posted a photo of her invitation, she was quickly uninvited, then presumably renditioned to whatever CIA black site holds Swift's enemies. (Jack Antonoff, of Bleachers and fun., who has recently co-written several songs with Swift, says that \"just having her songs on my hard drive makes me feel like I have Russian secrets or something. It's terrifying.\") \n \n At the moment, Swift is in a makeup chair in her dressing room, getting false eyelashes applied. She's wearing a black miniskirt, black tights and a fuzzy pink top with a cartoon drawing of a cat, and her wavy blond hair is pinned back tight. She's five feet 10, but she looks much taller, even with her lanky legs wrapped underneath her like a pretzel twist. \"I need lunch like, whoa,\" Swift says, and an assistant tells her there's a sushi order happening. \"Oooh,\" she purrs. \"Get a boatload.\" \n \n See Taylor Swift like you never have before in behind-the-scenes footage from Theo Wenner's cover shoot here: \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n The video is for Swift's soon-to-be-Number One single, \"Shake It Off,\" which she'll perform for the first time at the VMAs later this summer, but which at this point only a handful of people outside the room even know exists. There are worries about spies and recording devices. \"Don't even get me started on wiretaps,\" Swift says seriously. \"It's not a good thing for me to talk about socially. I freak out.\" As for who might bug a Van Nuys production office on the off chance that Swift is inside: \"The janitor,\" she says, as if naming one candidate among hundreds. \"The janitor who's being paid by TMZ. This is gonna sound like I'm a crazy person \u2013 but we don't even know. I have to stop myself from thinking about how many aspects of technology I don't understand.\" \n \n Swift pauses, as if weighing just how paranoid she's comfortable with sounding. Then she plows ahead. \"Like speakers,\" she says. \"Speakers put sound out . . . so can't they take sound in? Or\" \u2013 she holds up her cellphone \u2013 \"they can turn this on, right? I'm just saying. We don't even know.\" \n \n Swift says she never feels completely safe, especially when it comes to her privacy. \"There's someone whose entire job it is to figure out things that I don't want the world to see,\" she says. \"They look at your career, they look at what you prioritize, and they try to figure out what would be the most revealing or hurtful. Like, I don't take my clothes off in pictures or anything \u2013 I'm very private about that. So it scares me how valuable it would be to get a video of me changing. It's sad to have to look for cameras in dressing rooms and bathrooms. I don't walk around naked with my windows open, because there's a value on that.\" \n \n And yet, despite the DEFCON-3 level of security, in a lot of ways Swift has never felt more free. She has a new album out in October, 1989, that she's insanely excited about, because it signals her transition from a country star who likes pop to a straight-up pop star. She recently bought a luxe apartment in New York. And despite what you may have read in the gossip press, Swift hasn't been involved with a man in quite some time. She's not dating. She's not canoodling. She's not even sexting. Taylor Swift is single and loving it. \n \n \"I really like my life right now,\" she says. \"I have friends around me all the time. I've started painting more. I've been working out a lot. I've started to really take pride in being strong. I love the album I made. I love that I moved to New York. So in terms of being happy, I've never been closer to that.\" Which is not necessarily the same as being happy. \n \n There's one way into Swift's new apartment building, and much of the time it's guarded by a former NYPD officer named Jimmy, who unlocks the door for residents and visitors alike. This may be a drag for neighbors like Steven Soderbergh and Orlando Bloom, who have dropped seven figures to live at one of Tribeca's toniest addresses, but it's an unavoidable fact of life when the 24-year-old on the top floor is one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. \"Most of the neighbors know what's what by now,\" Jimmy says, locking the door behind him. Today is a good day for Jimmy, because the elevator is working again after a brief period of being broken. \"It's six floors up,\" he says, frowning. \"And we don't travel light, if you know what I mean.\" I tell him I think I do know what he means, and Jimmy laughs. \"The shoes alone!\" \n \n Related PHOTOS: Teardrops on Her Guitar: Taylor Swift's 10 Countriest Songs Though she may \"Shake It Off\" these days, Taylor Swift's first seven years always kept a foot in Nashville \n \n Up in the penthouse, a barefoot Swift answers the door in a periwinkle-blue sundress: \"Welcome to my apartment!\" In the kitchen there's an assortment of pastries from a hip downtown spot called the Smile (\"They have these banana-quinoa muffins that I'm obsessed with\"), and in the refrigerator are a surprising number of varieties of sparkling water. (\"I have black cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, strawberry, key lime, tangerine lime . . .\") \n \n Swift shuts the fridge. \"Do you want a tour?\" She breezes into the living room, pointing out the fish tank filled with vintage baseballs (\"I was like, 'That's so cool, they're so old!'\") and some enormous scented candles (\"I was like, 'That's so cool, they're so big!'\"). \"There's my piano,\" she says. \"Here's my pool table that always has cat hair on it. That's my skylight.\" She bumps into a doorway. \"That's a door that I walk into.\" \n \n Theo Wenner \n \n Swift bought this apartment about six months ago, for a reported $15 million. (Swift also bought the unit across the hall, for about $5 million; she uses it to house her security team.) It took a lot of work just to see it: It belonged to the director Peter Jackson, who had an actor friend crashing here, so the brokers didn't want to bother him much. \"Sir Ian McKellen,\" Swift says seriously. \"I think once you're Gandalf, you can always just stay in Peter Jackson's house.\" \n \n Swift leads the way into one of her four guest bedrooms. \"This is where Karlie usually stays,\" she says \u2013 meaning supermodel Karlie Kloss, one of her new BFFs, whom she met nine months ago at the Victoria's Secret fashion show. There's a basket of Kloss's favorite Whole Foods treats next to the bed, and multiple photos of her on the walls. Against another wall, there's a rack full of white nightgowns. \"This is a thing me and Lena have,\" says Swift \u2013 meaning Lena Dunham, another recent friend. \"We wear them during the day and look like pioneer women, fresh off the Oregon Trail.\" \n \n Swift met Dunham in 2012, after she watched Girls and became obsessed. She went on Twitter to follow Dunham, and coincidentally saw that Dunham had just tweeted admiringly about Swift. \"I was really scared she was being ironic, but I decided to follow her anyway, just in case. Within five minutes I had a direct message from her. Let me see if I still have it.\" She spends a minute scrolling through her phone. \"I still have it! She said, 'I am so excited about the prospect of being friends with you that I added the adjective best in front of it.' 'The idea that you like my show is so thrilling, and I can't wait to lavish you with praise in person.'\" \n \n As a recent New York transplant in her mid-twenties, Swift says Girls is like her Sex and the City. \"I could label all my girlfriends as Shoshannas, Jessas, Marnies or Hannahs,\" she says. And which would she be? \"I've thought about this a lot,\" she says. A pause. \"I'm Shoshanna.\" \n \n She seems resigned to this. \"Shoshanna gets excited about things, she's really girly. And when she was in a relationship that was very comfortable, she made the decision to get out and go experience new things on her own. And now she's becoming more sure of herself and taking life head-on, in a way that I can relate to. Even though I've never accidentally smoked crack at a warehouse party and run pantsless through Brooklyn.\" (Dunham, meanwhile, thinks Swift is more like \"Hannah, minus the horrid sexual behavior. Or Marnie, if she wasn't an asshole.\") \n \n Swift leads the way upstairs to her bedroom. Asleep on her massive four-poster bed is a tiny white ball of fur. \"Olivia!\" Swift says, scooping her up. It's her two-month old kitten, named after Olivia Benson, from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. \"Hear how loud she's purring? She's a stage-five clinger, for sure.\" Downstairs somewhere is her other cat, Meredith, named after Meredith Grey from Grey's Anatomy. \"Strong, complex, independent women,\" Swift says. \"That's the theme.\" \n \n Behind the cover story: Josh Eells on what it's really like spending time with Taylor: \n \n She steps onto her patio and climbs the staircase up to the roof deck. \"Careful,\" she says. \"It's construction central.\" A forest of skyscrapers surrounds her; the Freedom Tower looks close enough to touch. Swift gestures to a set of planters: \"Those are hydrangeas, and over there are the roses and basil and rosemary.\" Heading back downstairs, she passes an antique lamp with the inscription CALADIUM SEGUINUM on it. Swift took Latin in high school, but says she isn't sure what it means. (Later, I look it up. It turns out it's a homeopathic remedy for male impotence.) \n \n For years, Swift was terrified to move to New York. \"I was intimidated by it for so long,\" she says. But now that she's here, she loves it. She can walk down the street to get dinner, or go furniture shopping with friends in Brooklyn. Even the paparazzi are better, she says. \"They don't provoke me, or ask weird questions. And a lot of them are long-lensing it \u2013 which, if you have to have paparazzi in your life, is such a better way.\" She likes it so much she's trying to recruit friends to move here \u2013 like her buddy Selena Gomez. \"Project Selena,\" Swift says. \"I think I can do it.\" \n \n Back in the living room, Swift settles into the couch with a muffin and starts talking about her Fourth of July. She invited a bunch of friends up to Rhode Island, where she has a house in a fancy community called Watch Hill. It was raining, and the day looked like a bust, until her friend Jaime King's husband came up with the idea to buy eight Slip 'N Slides and lay them end to end like some unholy Slip 'N Slide centipede. Even with the rain, the slides still weren't slippery enough, so they got a bunch of olive oil and poured it all over themselves. (\"There was a dangerous level of slipperiness,\" Swift says.) Later they all went to the beach, which is normally full of Swift-gawkers (\"Hotel fees have doubled in the year we've been there,\" Swift says), but was empty that day because of the rain. That night they cooked a huge feast, with Swift assigning everyone jobs (\"You make salad dressing! You chop apples for apple pie!\"), and afterward they played Celebrity, the game where everyone puts a bunch of famous names in a hat and takes turns drawing one and trying to make their team guess. The game got a little heated, because one team had a lot more famous people on it, which gave them what some guests thought was an unfair advantage. (Swift: \"It was like, 'You dated him! 2010!'\") But in the end, everyone was appeased, and the game went on as planned. And did Swift's team win? She smiles. \"Of course we won.\" \n \n Swift bought the Rhode Island house in April 2013, for a reported $17 million. The old summer estate of a Standard Oil heiress, it boasts water views in every room and a seagull Swift named George Washington that swims in her pool. Swift calls it her \"dream house,\" but it's also been the source of some of her first truly negative press. The trouble started when she redid her sea wall, which she says hadn't been updated since the house was built in 1929. She hired a team of engineers, who spent all winter rebuilding it; she thought she was doing something nice, until some locals got angry and accused her of ruining the beach. (TMZ: \"Taylor Swift Neighbors Pissed: You're Screwing With Our Coastline!!\") \n \n It wasn't long before the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council stepped in to say that Swift hadn't done anything wrong. Still, for Swift, the wall became sort of a metaphor for haters in general. \"There will always be people who grumble about things,\" she says. \"But when they saw what it looked like when it was finished \u2013 it looked so much nicer! The other wall had all this graffiti on it \u2013 it looked old, and not in a good way. But it was a problem, so I fixed it. Nothing has changed about anyone's beach experience, except that now my house won't fall on them. So, you know. Sorry not sorry.\" \n \n The only way to hear 1989 in full is to borrow Swift's iPhone, which is white and silver and covered in kitten stickers. There are 13 songs in all, plus a handful of bonus tracks, filed under the unbreakable code name \"Sailor Twips.\" (She will only play them over headphones, because of wiretaps.) There are also hundreds of voice memos containing sketches of chords and melodies, which is how most of her songs start out. Antonoff (who also happens to be Dunham's boyfriend) says that for one song they wrote together, he sent Swift a track \"and literally 30 minutes later she sent me back a voice note that sounded exactly like the record.\" \n \n As the title suggests, 1989 was influenced by some of Swift's favorite Eighties pop acts, including Phil Collins, Annie Lennox and \"Like a Prayer\"-era Madonna. (Given that 1989 is also the year Swift was born, she necessarily got into them later, usually via VH1's Pop-Up Video.) The album was executive-produced by Swift and Max Martin, with whom she first collaborated on her 2012 single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\" Officially, it's not even finished yet: Somewhere in Sweden, Martin is tinkering until the very last minute to ensure the drum sounds are as up-to-date as possible. \n \n Theo Wenner \n \n Swift's last album, 2012's Red, straddled the line between country and pop. \"But at a certain point,\" she says, \"if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both.\" So this time, she set out to do full-on \"blatant pop music.\" A casual fan won't notice much difference, but to Swift and her brand, it's a big step. She says she won't be going to country-awards shows or promoting the album on country radio. When she first turned in the record, she says the head of her label, Scott Borchetta, told her, \"This is extraordinary \u2013 it's the best album you've ever done. Can you just give me three country songs?\" \n \n \"Love you, mean it,\" is how Swift characterizes her response. \"But this is how it's going to be.\" \n \n The other big change on 1989 is that for the first time in years, there are no diss tracks dishing about Swift's exes. A few of the songs are about her relationships and love life, but they're mostly wistful and nostalgic, not finger-pointy or score-settling. \"Different phases of your life have different levels of deep, traumatizing heartbreak,\" Swift says. \"And in this period of my life, my heart was not irreparably broken. So it's not as boy-centric of an album, because my life hasn't been boycentric.\" In fact, she suggests, she hasn't dated at all since breaking up with One Direction singer Harry Styles more than a year and a half ago. \"Like, have not gone on a date,\" she says. \"People are going to feel sorry for me when you write that. But it's true.\" \n \n Swift says dating is hard for her. For one thing, there's the logistics. \"Seventy percent of the time, when a guy asks me out, it'll just be a random e-mail,\" she says. Some movie star will get her address from his publicist and e-mail her cold. Usually she politely rebuffs them \u2013 but even if someone did penetrate that line of defense, building a relationship is hard. \n \n \"I feel like watching my dating life has become a bit of a national pastime,\" Swift says. \"And I'm just not comfortable providing that kind of entertainment anymore. I don't like seeing slide shows of guys I've apparently dated. I don't like giving comedians the opportunity to make jokes about me at awards shows. I don't like it when headlines read 'Careful, Bro, She'll Write a Song About You,' because it trivializes my work. And most of all, I don't like how all these factors add up to build the pressure so high in a new relationship that it gets snuffed out before it even has a chance to start. And so,\" she says, \"I just don't date.\" \n \n (That goes for hooking up as well. \"I just think it's pointless if you're not in love,\" Swift says. \"And I don't have the energy to be in love right now. So, no.\") \n \n Truth be told, Swift sounds a tiny bit jaded \u2013 which, for a \"self-professed hopeless romantic,\" maybe isn't the worst thing to be. \"It's not like I've sworn off love,\" she says. \"My life is just not conducive to bringing other people into it right now. I'm very childlike and romantic about lots of things, but I'm realistic about this.\" \n \n Swift pauses, searching for a metaphor that will help her explain herself. \"Have you heard of the Loneliest Whale? There's this whale \u2013 I think Adrian Grenier is making a documentary about it. It swims through the ocean, and it has a call unlike any other whale's. So it doesn't have anyone to swim with. And everybody feels so sorry for this whale \u2013 but what if this whale is having a great time? Because it's not bad that I'm not hopelessly in love with someone. It's not a tragedy, and it's not me giving up and being a spinster. Although I did get another cat.\" She laughs. \"I asked around: I was like, 'Does two cats count as cats?' But then I thought, what imaginary guy's perspective am I thinking about this from? Someone is going to think I'm undateable for a lot of reasons before they think I'm undateable because I have two cats.\" \n \n Since she's been single, Swift has been acquiring girlfriends with the fervor she once devoted to landing guys. (For instance: Two years ago she told Vogue she wanted to be friends with Kloss; now they're going to the gym together and taking road trips to Big Sur.) Swift says this is another byproduct of being single. \"When your number-one priority is getting a boyfriend, you're more inclined to see a beautiful girl and think, 'Oh, she's gonna get that hot guy I wish I was dating,'\" she says. \"But when you're not boyfriend-shopping, you're able to step back and see other girls who are killing it and think, 'God, I want to be around her.'\" As an example, she cites her pal Lorde, whom she calls Ella. \"It's like this blazing bonfire,\" Swift says. \"You can either be afraid of it because it's so powerful and strong, or you can go stand near it, because it's fun and it makes you brighter.\" \n \n Earlier in her career, Swift deflected questions about feminism because she didn't want to alienate male fans. But these days, she's proud to identify herself as a feminist. To her, all feminism means is wanting women to have the same opportunities as men. \"I don't see how you could oppose that.\" Dunham says Swift has always been a feminist whether she called herself one or not: \"She runs her own company, she's creating music that connects to other women instead of creating a sexual persona for the male gaze, and no one is in control of her. If that's not feminism, what is?\" \n \n Swift's focus on sisterhood cuts both ways, because when another woman crosses her, she's equally fierce about hitting back. The angriest song on 1989 is called \"Bad Blood,\" and it's about another female artist Swift declines to name. \"For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\" she says. \"She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'\" Then last year, the other star crossed a line. \"She did something so horrible,\" Swift says. \"I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational \u2013 you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it.\" \n \n (Pressed, Swift admits there might have been a personal element to the conflict. \"But I don't think there would be any personal problem if she weren't competitive,\" she says.) \n \n Theo Wenner \n \n As is often the case, Swift dealt with her emotions by writing about them. \"Sometimes the lines in a song are lines you wish you could text-message somebody in real life,\" she says. \"I would just be constantly writing all these zingers \u2013 like, 'Burn. That would really get her.' And I know people are going to obsess over who it's about, because they think they have all my relationships mapped out. But there's a reason there are not any overt call-outs in that song. My intent was not to create some gossip-fest. I wanted people to apply it to a situation where they felt betrayed in their own lives.\" \n \n Swift prides herself on never explicitly saying whom her songs are about, and she's not going to start with this one. Yes, she sprinkles clues in her liner notes and makes winking references onstage, but she tries to keep them obscure enough to maintain some modicum of mystery (or at least plausible deniability). She's so disciplined on this front that she won't even say any of her ex-boyfriends' names out loud \u2013 so when she does slip up, even in the most innocent way possible, it's highly entertaining. \n \n Swift is still talking about \"Bad Blood\" when she starts to explain why she wants everyone to know it's about a female. \"I know people will make it this big girl-fight thing,\" she says. \"But I just want people to know it's not about a guy. You don't want to shade someone you used to date and make it seem like you hate him, when that's not the case. And I knew people would immediately be going in one direction\u2014\" As she suddenly realizes that she just accidentally referenced her ex-boyfriend's band, Swift goes white. She buries her face in her hands. \"Why?!\" she howls, cracking up. It's a classic Taylor Swift Surprised Face, only for real this time. \n \n Swift won't say much about her relationship with Styles, other than that they're now friends. But talking to her, it seems clear that many of the songs on 1989 that are about a guy are about him. There's \"I Wish You Would,\" about an ex who bought a house two blocks from hers (whom she implies was Styles). And \"All You Had to Do Was Stay,\" about a guy who was never willing to commit (ditto). Then there's the song that sets a new high-water mark for Swiftian faux secrecy \u2013 a sexy Miami Vice-sounding throwback about a guy with slicked-back hair and a white T-shirt and a girl in a tight little skirt that is called \u2013 no joke \u2013 \"Style.\" (She allows herself a satisfied grin. \"We should have just called it 'I'm Not Even Sorry.'\") \n \n Of all the songs on the album that seem to be about Styles, the most intriguing one is \"Out of the Woods.\" Co-written by Antonoff, it's a frantic tale of a relationship where, Swift says, \"every day was a struggle. Forget making plans for life \u2013 we were just trying to make it to next week.\" The most interesting part comes when Swift sings, \"Remember when you hit the brakes too soon/Twenty stitches in a hospital room.\" She says it was inspired by a snowmobile ride with an ex who lost control and wrecked it so badly that she saw her life flash before her eyes. Both of them had to go to the ER, although Swift wasn't hurt. She corrects herself: \"Not as hurt.\" \n \n For a couple whose every move was so thoroughly documented, it's kind of shocking to think that something as newsworthy as a trip to the emergency room wouldn't have wound up on the Internet. \"You know what I've found works even better than an NDA?\" says Swift. \"Looking someone in the eye and saying, 'Please don't tell anyone about this.'\" Even so, it's impressive: The most top-secret hospital visit would necessarily involve three or four witnesses \u2013 and none of them talked? \n \n Swift says that's sort of her point. \"People think they know the whole narrative of my life,\" she says. \"I think maybe that line is there to remind people that there are really big things they don't know about.\" \n \n I didn't know what kind of coffee you wanted, so I brought options.\" \n \n Two weeks later, Swift is in the back seat of an SUV idling next to Central Park, with a tray of four iced coffees balanced on her lap. Outside wait a dozen paparazzi and several dozen fans. The plan is to take a nice walk in the park \u2013 and maybe, though this is unspoken, to get a glimpse of the attention she faces daily. \n \n Swift takes her bodyguard's hand and steps out of the car. She's dressed in the decidedly un-park-friendly outfit of a tweed skirt and crop top, pink suede Louboutin pumps, and a yellow Dolce & Gabbana bag. She navigates the muddy trail impressively in her heels, the crowd behind her swelling every few feet. In front of her, two bodyguards clear a path. Behind her, another bodyguard carries a bag of scones. \n \n Swift turns down a dead-end path where the paparazzi can't follow and takes a seat in a gazebo on the shores of the lake. On the wooden posts are carved hundreds of initials, the stories of couples who came before \u2013 the kind of thing that might appear in a Taylor Swift song. Excitedly, Swift points at the lake: \"Turtles! And ducks!\" She looks at the ground. \"Oh. And a used condom.\" \n \n Swift says that the only time she could come to the park and have it be normal would be in the middle of the night (\"which is dangerous\") or at four in the morning (\"which is early\"). She hasn't driven alone in five years, and she can't leave her home without being swarmed by fans. (\"When a sweet little 12-year-old says to their mom, 'Taylor lives an hour from here . . .' \u2013 more times than not, they'll make the trip.\") Although she doesn't like to draw attention to it, she says there is a contingent of fans that think her songs contain hidden messages to them. \"Think about it,\" she says. \"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone? Take that, add 'crazytown' to it, and it sounds like an invitation for kidnapping.\" \n \n Theo Wenner \n \n We've been talking for a while when a boat rows up carrying three teenagers \u2013 two girls and a guy. \"Oh, my God!\" says one of the girls. \"Today is my birthday! Can I please take a picture with you?\" Swift laughs. \"You can, but I don't know how you're going to. You're on a boat, buddy!\" \n \n \"I'll get off!\" the girl says. \"I'll find a way.\" Swift and her bodyguard reach out and help her into the pavilion. \"You're going to make me cry!\" she says. \n \n \"Is it really your birthday?\" Swift asks. \n \n \"How old are you?\" \n \n \"Seventeen,\" the girl says. \n \n \"Oh, that's a good year.\" \n \n \"I know. I'm excited.\" \n \n The girl says she lives on Long Island. She and her friends took the train in for the day. \"That's cute,\" Swift says. \"Are you going to dinner somewhere?\" \n \n The girl scrunches up her face. \"We were going to . . . Chipotle?\" \n \n Swift smiles. She goes to her purse and pulls out a wad of cash \u2013 $90, to be exact. \"Here,\" she says. \"Go somewhere nice.\" \n \n \"Oh, my God,\" the girl says. \"Thank you!\" She climbs back in the boat, and she and her friends paddle off. \n \n Pretty soon it's time to go. One of Swift's bodyguards, Jeff, a former Marine Corps anti-terrorism specialist, comes over to brief her. \"OK, we've got a six-minute walk to the exit. Twitter is going like wildfire, so some of the more obsessive fans . . .\" He trails off. \"We're just gonna close the gap on you and keep them back.\" \n \n Swift gives her bangs one last check in her phone's camera, then she looks out at the lake. \"I wish we had a boat.\" \n \n She stands up to go. Immediately we're surrounded by a crush of paparazzi and fans. Even the hot-dog vendors are snapping pictures. As Swift winds her way through the park, the crowd grows larger and more aggressive; it's a little scary. \"OK, everybody, we need some room, please!\" Jeff says. \"Step back. Give her space!\" \n \n But Swift is unfazed. \"You want to know a trick to immediately go from feeling victimized to feeling awesome?\" she says. She pulls out her phone and hands me the earbuds: \"This is my go-to.\" She presses play, and Kendrick Lamar's \"Backseat Freestyle\" fills the speakers. As Swift bobs her head, Lamar raps: \n \n All my life I want money and power \n \n Respect my mind or die from lead shower \n \n I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower \n \n So I can fuck the world for 72 hours \n \n Goddamn, I feel amazing \n \n Damn, I'm in the Matrix . . . \n \n Swift smiles wide. \"I know every word.\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Perry implied she's the one Swift declined to identify by referencing 2004's Mean Girls. \"Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing...\" the singer tweeted Tuesday. \n \n Does that make Swift Cady Heron in this scenario? And is mutual ex John Mayer the Aaron Samuels? Regardless, the 24-year-old \"Mean\" singer has yet to reply to the 29-year-old \"Firework\" singer's tweet. \n \n The ex-country star implied Perry was the inspiration for the song \"Bad Blood,\" which appears on her new album, 1989. \"For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?' Then last year, the other star crossed a line,\" Swift recalled. \"She did something so horrible, I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy!\" \n \n Swift, who counts Lena Dunham and Karlie Kloss as BFFs, continued, \"It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me.\" \n \n For 15 months, Swift toured the globe to promote Red. Perry kicked off her Prismatic World Tour in May 2014, with concerts scheduled in Australia, France and the United States, among other countries.",

BuzzFeed speculates she could be talking about three backup dancers who reportedly ditched Swift for Perry last year\u2014and E! notes that Perry tweeted today, \"Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing...,\" a Mean Girls reference that could be a hint that Perry is indeed the song's subject. \"For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\" Swift says in Rolling Stone of her unnamed colleague. \"[Then] she did something so horrible.

But at the end of the day, I can't be ungrateful, because I chose this. Sometimes it would be nice if someone just said, 'Hey, I think it's really cool that you have that cat on your head!' But the other half was going, 'What if he just wants to walk around with a cat on his head, and not have his picture taken all day?' \u2013 Taylor Swift opens up about her life, her career, and, of course, her love life in the new issue of Vanity Fair. Highlights: On her career: \"There's someone whose entire job it is to figure out things that I don't want the world to see. Like, I doesn't take my clothes off in pictures or anything\u2014I'm very private about that. So it scares me how valuable it would be to get a video of me changing. It's sad to have to look for cameras in dressing rooms and bathrooms. I don\u2019t walk around naked with my windows open \u2013 Taylor Swift is the new cover girl for Harper's Bazaar, and among the nuggets from the interview: She's \"obsessed\" with Lena Dunham. \"I could label all my girlfriends as Shoshannas, Jessas, Marnies, or Hannahs,\" she says. \"And which would she be? I've thought about this a lot.\" She could relate: \"Shoshanna gets excited about things, she's really girly. And when she was in a relationship that was very comfortable, she made the decision to get out and go experience new things on her own.\" She recently moved to New \u2013 Taylor Swift is on the cover of Vanity Fair, and one of the nuggets from the interview is that she wants Selena Gomez to move in with her. \"Project Selena,\" she says. \"I think I can do it.\" Highlights: On moving to New York: \"I was intimidated by it for so long. But now that she's here, she loves it. She can walk down the street to get dinner, or go furniture shopping with friends in Brooklyn. Even the paparazzi are better. And a lot of them are long-lensing it\u2014which, if you have to have paparazzi in your life, is \u2013 Taylor Swift's new album, 1989, is out tomorrow, but you won't be able to hear it until you borrow her iPhone, which is covered in kitten stickers. That's because there are only 13 songs on the album, plus a handful of bonus tracks, all filed under the code name \"Sailor Twips.\" There are also \"hundreds of voice memos containing sketches of chords and melodies\" that she will only play over headphones, because of wiretaps, she explains to Vogue. The only way to hear the album in full is to borrow it, she says: \"So, you know. \u2013 Taylor Swift's new album, 1989, is out today\u2014and in a new interview with Vanity Fair, she explains why it's so different this time around. Her 2012 album, Red, straddled the line between country and pop. \"But at a certain point,\" she says, \"if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both.\" So this time, she set out to do full-on \"blatant pop music.\" \"Different phases of your life have different levels of deep, traumatizing heartbreak,\" she explains. \"And in this period of my life, my heart was not irreparably broken \u2013 Taylor Swift is the new cover girl for Paper magazine, and she opens up a bit about her life, her career, and, of course, her love life.

Midazolam is also given to produce amnesia (loss of memory) so that the patient will not remember any discomfort or undesirable effects that may occur after a surgery or procedure . It is also used to produce loss of consciousness before and during surgery. Midazolam is sometimes used in patients in hospital intensive care units to cause unconsciousness. This may allow the patient to withstand the stress of being in the intensive care unit and help the patient cooperate when a machine must be used to assist with breathing. \n \n Midazolam is given only by or under the immediate supervision of a doctor trained to use this medicine. If you will be receiving midazolam during surgery, your doctor or anesthesiologist will give you the medicine and closely follow your progress. \n \n This product is available in the following dosage forms: \n \n Solution ||||| A man in Italy who was in what doctors call a \"minimally conscious state\" for nearly two years unexpectedly regained full consciousness and the ability to talk, according to a new report of his case. \n \n The man woke up after he was given a drug normally used as a sedative before surgery and other medical procedures, the case report showed. \n \n The 43-year-old man was admitted to a hospital after a car accident, and was in a coma for 40 days. People who are comatose are completely unconscious \u2014 they have no sleep/wake cycles, and do not respond to their surroundings in any way. \n \n The man awoke from the coma but remained in a \"minimally conscious state,\" which means that although he remained largely unable to communicate or move, he was able to voluntarily open and close his eyes, and reach for and touch objects. He also had a sleep-wake cycle. \n \n When he was discharged from the hospital 10 months later, he still did not talk or communicate with other people, nor did he respond to simple commands asking him to, for instance, close his eyes. \n \n Over the next year, the man's cognitive ability started to decline; his movements became abnormally slow; and he began to engage in aimless, repetitive behaviors, such as clapping. \n \n But then, about two years after the accident, the man's doctors wanted to examine his brain using a CT scan. To do the scan, they gave the man a mild sedative called midazolam. [7 Mind-Bending Facts About Dreams] \n \n A few minutes later, the man began to talk and interact with others. \n \n \"He talked by cellphone with his aunt and congratulated his brother when he was informed of his graduation; he recognized the road leading to his home,\" the researchers who treated the man wrote in the case report. However, the man did not remember the accident, and he was not aware of the way it had affected his health, they wrote. \n \n This is the first report of midazolam having an \"awakening\" effect, the researchers said. \n \n However, the effect wore off after about two hours, and the man returned to his previous state, unresponsive to the environment, according to the study. \n \n To see whether it was indeed the drug that caused the brief improvement in the man's condition, the researchers gave the man midazolam again. Several minutes following the administration, the patient began to interact with his brother and answered questions the researchers asked him. He was also able to calculate simple math problems, such as 100 minus 7, as well as read and understand simple sentences, such as \"Close your eyes.\" \n \n This time around, the researchers scanned the man's brain before, during and after the administration of midazolam, and identified the locations within the brain that were affected by the drug. They found that those regions previously had been linked to the symptoms of catatonia, which is a state of unresponsiveness to stimuli that is often associated with schizophrenia. \n \n Moreover, the researchers noted, patients with catatonia have been reported to respond to midazolam in the past. The symptoms of the man in this report were similar to those of catatonic patients, which may mean that he was indeed catatonic and therefore responded to the drug, according to the study. \n \n However, it is not completely clear whether the patient did indeed suffer from catatonia or whether his condition merely included certain catatonic symptoms, the researchers wrote. \n \n Although midazolam was effective as a short-term method of treating the man's symptoms, the researchers said they could not keep giving it to him. Usually, the drug is given only to people in intensive-care units, where they can be monitored continuously, said Dr. Maria Chiara Carboncini, medical director of the Brain Injury Unit in the University Hospital of Pisa's Department of Neuroscience in Italy, who treated the patient and was a co-author of the report. \n \n The researchers tried treating the man with another drug called lorazepam, which belongs to the same class of drugs as midazolam but can be administered more easily, as the patient does not have to be monitored continuously, Carboncini told Live Science. \n \n However, after several days of therapy with lorazepam, the man became agitated and aggressive. His doctors switched him to carbamazepine, a drug used to treat people with epilepsy. This drug allowed the man to \"maintain the improvement of his ability to interact and communicate with people,\" Carboncini said. \n \n The study was published in the November issue of the journal Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience. \n \n Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

Doctors treated him with various meds to no avail but then gave him midazolam instead of the usual propofol (the same drug that killed Michael Jackson) before a CT scan. The man suddenly \"began to interact with the anesthetist,\" then with others, the study notes. The effect wore off after two hours, but doctors were able to replicate the results during a second midazolam dosage. The study notes that patients with catatonia (a state of unresponsiveness they're not sure this man suffered from) have responded to this drug before. Because midazolam can only be used in a hospital setting, doctors switched the patient over to carbamazepine (an epilepsy drug), which has since helped the man \"maintain the improvement of his ability to interact and communicate with people,\" a study co-author tells LiveScience.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) Members of the New York delegation cheer for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during the roll call at the Republican National Convention, Tuesday, July 19, 2016, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Evan... (Associated Press) \n \n CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 After weeks of planning and one ferocious outburst that upstaged nearly everything on the Republican National Convention's first day, conservatives' feisty but always improbable effort to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination succumbed to multiple causes of death. \n \n The lack of vital signs grew daily, culminating during Tuesday's roll call of the states that formally put Trump over the top. That vote saw a fizzling of what conservatives hoped would be an effort by some delegates to brazenly ignore state party rules and back the candidate of their choice, not Trump. \n \n \"Whatever may or may not have been planned, apparently it didn't happen,\" said Colorado delegate Kevin Grantham. He said party leaders wanted to \"make sure that Donald Trump is the nominee, regardless of what the states said, regardless of what the delegates say.\" \n \n The anti-Trump conservatives unified with another faction trying to alter party rules to shift power from the establishment Republican National Committee to grassroots activists, including many supporters of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a defeated presidential hopeful. But they were badly outnumbered by Trump delegates and party regulars who believed, like him or not, he'd won this year's GOP primaries. \n \n Also weighing against them \u2014 the rebels' lack of an alternative candidate, vigorous lobbying by an alliance between the Trump campaign and the RNC and a growing sense that it was time to unite against presumptive Democratic pick Hillary Clinton. \n \n \"You can stand your ground until the point comes when you would be compromising the country or the state,\" said Steve House, chairman of the Colorado GOP, whose delegation was loaded with dissidents and Cruz supporters. \"The team said, 'Let's stand up and support the nominee.' \" \n \n On the other side of the arena, the Utah delegation gamely announced that it was casting its 40 votes for Cruz. But the presiding officer awarded all those delegates to Trump because of a quirk in Utah GOP rules that allow votes only for active candidates at the convention \u2014 and Trump was the only one. \n \n \"There's been a lot of effort to make sure we have a smooth convention, that Donald Trump is the nominee and that we unite,\" said Phil Wright, chairman of the Utah delegation. He said awarding all the votes to Trump was the GOP's way \"of trying to squash any dissent.\" \n \n Since it became clear last spring that Trump was the likely nominee, conservative delegates around the country plotted ways to use the party's rules to derail him at the convention. They organized using social media, conference calls and seemingly endless emails. \n \n But they were soundly thrashed last week when the convention's rules committee approved guidelines for this week's gathering. That carried over to the convention itself, which is run by party leaders who wield the gavel and make final rulings on disputes. \n \n On Monday, conservatives demanded a final shot at rewriting party rules but were blocked. Their roars of outrage drew widespread coverage and distracted from party leaders' efforts to show unity, but still they lost. \n \n During Tuesday's roll call, the Alaska delegation split its 28 votes among Trump, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Convention officials counted all 28 Alaskan delegates for Trump, citing a discrepancy in state party rules, and overruled the delegation when it demanded a fresh count. \n \n Underscoring the futility in challenging party leaders, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus explained the ruling against Alaska to the entire convention and said, \"In any event, have a great night.\" He then quickly left the stage as music began to play, leaving the Alaska delegates unhappy and vanquished. \n \n ___ \n \n AP congressional correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| So it\u2019s official: Donald J. Trump is the Republican nominee for president in 2016. There\u2019s no \"presumptive\" about it anymore; the delegates have voted and made it official. \n \n That was probably the biggest news of the Republican National Convention\u2019s second night, but once the actual business of the event was out of the way, the focus was on jobs and family. \n \n The night\u2019s official theme was \"Make America Work Again,\" and the political speakers, notably Trump\u2019s former rivals and current sycophants Chris Christie and Ben Carson, tried to focused their rhetoric on jobs, touting Trump\u2019s business experience and repeating tried-and-true Republican attack lines on President Obama\u2019s economic record. \n \n But the show occasionally deviated from that theme with speeches from two of Trump\u2019s children: Tiffany, his 22-year-old daughter with second wife Marla Maples; and Donald Trump Jr., Donald\u2019s firstborn and a key lieutenant in the Trump Organization. \n \n This being Trump, the proceedings were not exactly stage-managed to perfection, and there were definite winners and losers at the end of the night. Here\u2019s who ended Tuesday behind \u2014 and ahead. \n \n Winner: Criminalization of politics \n \n Chris Christie delivered easily the most chilling speech of the evening, referring back to his time as US attorney for New Jersey and leading the crowd in a mock prosecution of Hillary Clinton. \n \n His charges were numerous, and went beyond even the most extreme of Trump\u2019s talking points in some places. They included: \n \n \"Ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity\" \n \n \"An apologist for an al-Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women\" \n \n \"Putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of good-paying jobs for middle-class Americans\" \n \n \"She called Assad a different kind of leader. There are now 400,000 dead. Think about that: 400,000 dead. At the hands of the man that Hillary defended.\" \n \n \"An inept negotiator of the worst nuclear arms deal in American history\" \n \n \"A failed strategist who has permitted Russia back in as a major player in the Middle East\" \n \n \"A coddler of the brutal Castro brothers and betrayer of the family of fallen Trooper Werner Foerster\" \n \n \"Lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment\" \n \n After each of these accusations, Christie would ask the crowd: \"Guilty or not guilty?\" And the crowd would roar back, \"GUILTY!\" occasionally adding in a chant of, \"Lock her up!\" \n \n There were two genuinely unusual and somewhat shocking dimensions to Christie\u2019s speech. One was the sheer severity of the charges he leveled against Clinton. He didn\u2019t merely accuse her of mishandling Boko Haram. He directly accused her of responsibility for Boko Haram\u2019s schoolgirl kidnappings, calling her an \"apologist\" for one of the most brutal terrorist groups on the planet. He didn\u2019t merely accuse her of mishandling Syria but implied she was responsible for every death in the Syrian civil war. \n \n These are truly grave charges for which there is no evidence, yet Christie leveled them casually, like they were any other campaign talking point. That\u2019s a remarkable escalation of rhetoric even for this bananas election. \n \n The second shocking element of the speech was the ease with which Christie essentially called for the criminalization of political disagreement. You can like or dislike the Iranian nuclear deal. But helping negotiate it, and supporting it, is not a crime. Doing that is participating in statecraft. Christie suggested that bad policy should put you before a jury ready and eager to condemn you for anything they deem mistakes. \n \n The whole feel of the speech \u2014 a prosecutor inviting a mob to condemn the accused on count after count \u2014 resembled a show trial more than anything else, free of any and all protections for the defendant. Obviously it wasn\u2019t a real trial of any kind. But the implication was nonetheless clear: Clinton deserves to be dragged to court for what she\u2019s done when what she\u2019s done is pursue policy options that Chris Christie doesn\u2019t like. \n \n It was a performative case for criminalizing disagreement, a perverse and authoritarian pageant that preyed on the worst, darkest tendencies of the Trump movement. \n \n Winner: Donald Trump \n \n Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. Officially. \n \n The votes are tallied. There can be no last-minute coup. The delegates aren\u2019t going to be unbound and rebel to some consensus candidate like Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan. A #NeverTrump revolt isn\u2019t going to happen. It\u2019s too late for NeverTrumpers to mount a realistic third-party campaign. \n \n The convention went like every convention in recent memory: The delegates came and voted based on how they were bound, nominating the person everyone thought would be nominated. \n \n And yet unlike other recent conventions, the specter of a last-minute revolt hung over the 2016 RNC up until the last moment. As late in the game as Tuesday afternoon, there were still reported efforts to disrupt Trump\u2019s inevitable nomination: \n \n Some drama/suspense behind scenes at RNC: Cruz backers debate entering his name into nomination a few hours from now. Party leaders nervous. \u2014 Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) July 19, 2016 \n \n Yet despite all the scheming and the angst and the extreme unease of Republican elites in a position to attempt a putsch, Trump survived. He made it through. He got nominated. Whatever else happens this week, that\u2019s a significant victory \u2014 more significant, given the context, than it was for Mitt Romney or John McCain or other recent GOP nominees. \n \n Winner: Benghazi, the issue \n \n Monday night of the Republican convention was very heavy on Benghazi, featuring two veterans of the Annex Security Team and the mother of slain diplomat Sean Smith, and references from numerous other speakers on the \"Make America Safe Again\" national security theme night of the convention. \n \n That makes sense: Monday was supposed to be about foreign affairs and defense, so attacking the Democratic presumptive nominee\u2019s most famous foreign policy failing, particularly when the hardcore party activists at the convention are still deeply upset by that failing and what they perceive as its trivialization by the mainstream media, was a no-brainer. \n \n But Tuesday wasn\u2019t about national security. It was about jobs. And yet it was still about Benghazi. \n \n \"Hillary Clinton's bad judgment, as you heard last night, left us four dead Americans in Benghazi,\" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared in a speech that really should have been about the Clintons\u2019 history in his home state. \"She lied about her emails, about her server, about Benghazi,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked. \"She even lied to the family members of America's fallen heroes,\" Sen. Ron Johnson said, in an allusion to Patricia Smith's claim that Clinton lied to her about the cause of the Benghazi attacks. \n \n It was startling, especially coming after a first night already overloaded with Benghazi content, and a further sign that Donald Trump\u2019s RNC is not designed to persuade undecided voters. It\u2019s meant to excite his base by appealing to issues that enrage and energize them \u2014 even though those issues are not especially important to the people Trump needs to win over if he\u2019s to have any hope come November. \n \n This was Trump and fellow party members playing into a longstanding Republican tendency of extreme overreach when it comes to Clinton scandals \u2014 and doing it in a very high-profile way, using time they could be using for persuasion. \n \n Winner: The Trump kids \n \n Tuesday night was Donald Trump Jr. and Tiffany Trump\u2019s time to shine, another opportunity for members of the Trump family to humanize the candidate and present him as a real person with whom the American people can empathize and whom they can trust in the wake of their stepmother Melania\u2019s botched, plagiarist mess of a headliner speech. \n \n And they did a pretty great job! Tiffany offered an almost entirely apolitical speech that was polished, confident, and human. She clearly understood that her father has a reputation as a brutal, abrasive figure whom one might expect to be a domineering parent with impossible expectations, and immediately set about trying to disabuse viewers of that notion. \n \n \"As a recent college graduate, many of my accomplishments are still to come, but my dad takes such pride in all [I've] done so far no matter how big or small,\" she told the crowd. \"I still keep all my report cards because I like to look back and see the sweet notes he wrote on each and every one of them.\" Translation: My dad is a real person. He reacts to his kids\u2019 ups and downs the way any other parent would. He\u2019s not this asshole you think he is. \n \n Better still, she bolstered this kinder, gentler image of Donald Trump while tying it into components of his existing reputation. \"My dad is a natural-born encourager, the last person that will ever tell you to give up your dreams,\" she said. \"I always look forward to introducing him to my friends, especially the ones with preconceived notions, because they meet a man with natural charm and no facade. In person, my father is so friendly, considerate, funny, real.\" \n \n Here she\u2019s blended the counterintuitive vision of her dad she\u2019s trying to forward \u2014 as kind, generous, sweet \u2014 with the vision most already have, that he\u2019s relentless and persistent, for good or ill. Those qualities, she\u2019s arguing, didn\u2019t make him a merciless steamroller but a wonderful cheerleader and supportive figure. You don\u2019t need to buy the narrative she\u2019s pushing to respect the skill with which she pushed it. \n \n Donald Trump Jr. honestly seemed like a better candidate than his father, with a fluent grasp of the issues that Republican policy folks care about. He tried to defuse his and his siblings\u2019 reputations as rich brats by acknowledging their privileged upbringing upfront and then pivoting seamlessly into a call for school vouchers. \n \n \"My siblings and I growing up were truly fortunate to have choices and options that others don't. We want all Americans to have those same opportunities,\" he told the crowd. \"Our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class. Now they are stalled on the ground floor. They\u2019re run for the teachers and the administrators and not the students. You know what other countries do better on K-12 \u2014 they let parents choose where to send their children to school.\" \n \n Within a paragraph, he\u2019d turned his own privilege into a chance to portray himself and his father as compassionate and concerned with the plight of the poor \u2014 and as a chance to reassure conservatives of his father\u2019s ideological bona fides. \n \n The Trump progeny are not politicians, and there was no reason to expect their speeches to be especially great. But Donald Jr. and Tiffany acquitted themselves very well, delivering two of the best speeches of the night. \n \n Loser: Paul Ryan \n \n Most Americans weren\u2019t watching the convention as early as 8 pm; the major broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox) start coverage at 10. So relatively few people saw Paul Ryan oversee the roll call vote procedure that saw Donald Trump finally, and officially, nominated as the Republican presidential nominee in 2016. \n \n Still, this was clearly a loss for Ryan, who had to oversee the nomination of a man he once called a \"textbook\" racist, whom he for weeks pointedly refused to endorse, even after it became clear that man had won the primaries. \n \n Ryan has tried to put a brave face on Trump\u2019s nomination, arguing that he has little choice but to support the nominee. \"It is either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton,\" he said on CNN. \"You don't get a third option. It's one or the other.\" In essence, he\u2019s been trying to signal to elites that his grudging support for Trump was a matter of protocol and that he was still the smart conservative they\u2019ve come to love. \n \n But that balancing act went to hell the minute he stood before America and stated, \"Pursuant to rule 40d of the rules of the Republican Party, I formally declare Donald J. Trump and Michael R. Pence the Republican nominees for president and vice president of these United States...\" \n \n It\u2019s hard to imagine a better way to make Ryan\u2019s protestations that he was uncomfortable with Trump seem phony and worthless. When the chips are down, when the nomination was being decided, Ryan was out there in front, pushing Trump forward. He\u2019s not Trump-agnostic. He\u2019s Trump-boosting, the same as everyone else at this convention. \n \n Loser: States\u2019 delegate announcers \n \n During the seemingly interminable roll call vote for president, each state and district/territory participating in the convention picked someone to represent the delegation and formally cast its votes for the nomination. \n \n In some states, this was a fairly anonymous figure. But in others, it was a major politician, or at least a rising star. In Kentucky, it was Gov. Matt Bevin. In Iowa, it was former Secretary of State Matt Schultz, a likely future gubernatorial/senatorial candidate. In New Mexico, Gov. Susana Martinez introduced a junior delegate who did the honors, as she stood by smiling. \n \n The result was that a slew of promising Republicans, all with bright futures ahead of them, are on tape enthusiastically praising Donald Trump as the \"next president of the United States,\" or at the very least standing by happily as someone else does that. \n \n In deep red states like Kentucky, maybe that\u2019s not that damaging. But in swing states like Iowa and New Mexico, it\u2019s ideal attack ad fodder. One can all too easily imagining a Senate race in Iowa where Schultz\u2019s Democratic opponent plays footage of Shultz at this convention on loop to associate him with Donald Trump, who\u2019ll either be a hugely divisive incumbent president or a discredited, failed former candidate who lost Iowa. \n \n In normal years, like 2012, exercises like this don\u2019t really matter. Obviously everyone in the Republican Party backed Mitt Romney. But Trump is different, and everyone knows at some level that Trump is less acceptable. \n \n Loser: Michael Mukasey \n \n Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey is not exactly a moral paragon. Recruited from a district judgeship late in George W. Bush\u2019s second term as a more professional-seeming replacement for Alberto Gonzales, he is now best known for his participation in and defenses of the Bush administration\u2019s torture regime. \n \n He pointedly refused to say whether he considered waterboarding torture during his confirmation hearings, nearly derailing his nomination \u2014 only coming forward to suggest he thought it could be legal in some cases once in office. He would later gush of the CIA\u2019s torture program: \"Brave and serious men and women, faced with the most terrifying attack in American history, and \u2014 along with the rest of us \u2014 fearful of more, devised and executed a program to get intelligence from captured terrorists who refused to cooperate.\" He also falsely claimed that torture led to the capture of Osama bin Laden. \n \n So it was rather rich to see him take the stage at the Republican National Convention and complain about Hillary Clinton\u2019s systems administration practices, assailing them as indicative of Clinton\u2019s disrespect for the rule of law. It\u2019s a hard argument to take coming from someone who helped undermine the rule of law in the US by torturing people, which many would argue is worse than setting up a private email server. \n \n It was worse than rich, though.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Tuesday was \"Make America Work Again\" day at the Republican National Convention, though there was easily as much talk about Hillary Clinton as there was about the US economy. Still, the convention seemed to run far more smoothly than on Monday\u2014it was as if they \"had brought in an entirely new team of organizers,\" according to Politico\u2014and the GOP was unified enough to deal with the matter of choosing its nominee. Among the winners in another eventful day at the Quicken Loans Arena: Donald Trump. New York state's delegation put Trump over the top, making him the official GOP nominee 13 months after he launched what was seen as a long-shot bid. He \"did the unthinkable on Tuesday night. And, whether you like him or hate him, he deserves a massive amount of credit for that,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. Donald Trump Jr. He \"brought down the house\" with a speech that put him on the national stage and added a personal touch to his father's business successes, the Hill reports. It briefly looked like there might be a repeat of the Melania plagiarism controversy, but it quickly emerged that a Francis Buckley line in the speech had been put there by Buckley himself, a friend of Trump Jr.'s who worked on the speech with him. Chris Christie. The New Jersey governor may still be smarting from VP rejection, but the crowd loved how he denounced Clinton from the point of view of a former federal prosecutor. They chanted \"Guilty!\" and \"Lock her up!\" as Christie made the case against Clinton. Avocado growers. Discussion of jobs largely fell by the wayside, but soap opera actress Kimberlin Brown, who has an avocado farm in California, managed to deliver both an in-depth discussion of jobs and a passionate call to help US growers by restricting avocado imports, Politico reports. Among the losers: Party unity. Trump won the nomination, but some 721 delegates voted against him in the evening roll call, making it the most divided vote of its kind since the contested convention of 1976, the New York Times notes. Never Trump. The movement \"succumbed to multiple causes of death\" on Tuesday, with many rebels deciding they had no choice but to support the nominee, the AP reports. The Utah delegation announced that all its 40 votes were going to Ted Cruz, but they ended up going to Trump because Utah GOP rules require ballots to be cast for active candidates only. Paul Ryan. The House speaker has been trying to signal to party elites that he's uncomfortable with Trump and is \"still the smart conservative they've come to love,\" but the balancing act fell apart on Tuesday, according to Dylan Matthews at Vox. \"When the chips are down, when the nomination was being decided, Ryan was out there in front, pushing Trump forward,\" he writes. Ben Carson. He \"quickly went off script\u2014and not in a good way,\" writes Cillizza at the Post. His linking of Clinton to Lucifer via Saul Alinsky was a strange moment, writes Tina Nguyen at Vanity Fair, though since Carson has \"accidentally\" insulted Trump numerous times over the last few months, the campaign must have been relieved \"that Carson's meandering thoughts went straight to hell, and not somewhere closer to home.\"",

The lack of vital signs grew daily, culminating during Tuesday's roll call of the states that formally put Trump over the top. That vote saw a fizzling of what conservatives hoped would be an effort by some delegates to brazenly ignore state party rules and back the candidate of their choice, not Trump. \"Whatever may or may not have been planned, apparently it didn't happen,\" said \u2013 Alaska's 28 delegates to the Republican National Convention were officially Donald Trump's delegates Tuesday night\u2014and they weren't happy about it. The state's GOP chief, Randy Ruedrich, says he was \"disappointed\" and \"disgusted\" at the party's decision to count all 28 delegates for Trump instead of giving them a fresh vote, the Anchorage Daily News reports. He says the state GOP \"believes there should be a process in place for delegates to vote for a candidate of their choosing at the convention,\" and he wants all 28 to be \" proportionally selected.\" The state GOP says \u2013 It's official: Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president of the United States.

The site doesn\u2019t work. The president told everyone that they\u2019d get to keep their existing plans, now it turns out that many, many people can\u2019t. Some people now have to pay way more than they used to. Rates could skyrocket for everyone if enough people can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to sign up. This is what everyone \u2014 including people who only barely pay attention to the news, which is many millions of Americans \u2014 has been hearing, over and over again, for a full month now. That\u2019s bad news for the success of the law, and it\u2019s also bad news for the liberal experiment. \n \n First of all, yes, Brian Beutler is totally correct, the people using these stories for political gain are over-hyping the problem, disingenuous and wholly uninterested in the principle of universal healthcare. That\u2019s a given. In most instances, the policies being canceled are terrible fake policies that don\u2019t cover anything. Generally, the policies now available to these people will offer superior coverage. Many of the people whose policies were canceled will qualify for subsidies to buy better coverage. It\u2019s also quite possible \u2014 maybe probable \u2014 that insurance companies are intentionally trying to up-sell people on plans that will cost more out of pocket than other plans available on the exchanges. We know all this, because we read all the smart liberal bloggers. Most Americans don\u2019t! For most Americans, Obamacare is, so far, canceled plans and a nonworking website. \n \n This biggest problem is that the website just isn\u2019t functional, but let\u2019s take the administration at its word when it says that will be fixed in November. That\u2019s not going to be close to the end of it. Which is why Republicans spent more time hammering Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about Obama\u2019s \u201cyou get to keep your plan\u201d line than the site troubles: They know it\u2019s going to be a longer-lasting and more damaging story. Even if the website is fixed in a few weeks, these stories will continue to dominate the news for months. \n \n And not just the news outlets that political elites pay attention to. People with canceled plan letters and \u201crate shock\u201d horror stories will be featured on local news broadcasts across the country, with even less context and explanation that you\u2019ll find on the national news, because local TV news is pretty uniformly terrible. And they\u2019ll keep getting featured, because there are simply going to be a ton of people who get their policies canceled and then get asked to pay more. Sarah Kliff estimates 7-12 million people. That\u2019s a fraction of the total population, and many of these people may now qualify for Medicaid or subsidies, but that\u2019s still a lot of people deeply frustrated by \u201cObamacare\u201d right as it begins its much-publicized rollout. \n \n All of that is exactly why this is a dumb way to give people health insurance. This is a program that, by design, is going to annoy literally millions of Americans immediately. It will improve most of those people\u2019s lives, but it will do so in a way that feels as coercive as possible. It didn\u2019t have to be that way! No one is ever annoyed that they qualify for Medicare or Medicaid. People may hate paying the taxes that fund those programs, but people always appreciate direct benefits. \n \n The way the ACA deals with people who had previously purchased crappy insurance on the individual market \u2014 and the way insurance companies have chosen to deal with these people \u2014 illustrates nearly every problem with attempting to design conservative, \u201cmarket-based\u201d ways to do things best done by straightforward government programs. It exposes the flaws in both the technocratic wing of the Democratic Party \u2014 a too-clever solution to a very simple problem \u2014 and the centrist third-way wing \u2014 making legislation intentionally worse to shield Democrats from increasingly ineffective accusations of liberalism, or to pick up Republican support that, in this environment, is never coming. So we end up with a program that hides many of its best and most important features, and loudly advertises its most coercive element. \n \n Democrats created this mess for themselves. Conservative Democrats are responsible for many of the program\u2019s flaws, and, perversely, their attempts to shield themselves from public outrage ended up creating a law that will lead to more public outrage than a more government-oriented program would\u2019ve. But the program was designed by moderate and even liberal Democrats. They were working to appease the conservatives, yes, but we should have long since learned that a conservative congressional Democrat will only ever agree to something if you promise to make it a little bit, or a lot, worse. In other words, the ask should\u2019ve been bigger. ||||| Henry Waxman made a plea at the end of Wednesday\u2019s House hearing grilling of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The California Democrat and liberal lion asked Republicans to reach across the aisle to work with Democrats to improve Obamacare. \n \n Yes, Henry Waxman, who has made a career of ideological witch hunts and smash-mouth partisanship, wants a cease-fire over Obamacare, or so he says. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Sebelius apologizes for glitches Obama blasts ACA critics \n \n Waxman was picking up a common liberal theme: It\u2019s not fair that Republicans continue to oppose the president\u2019s eponymous health care law and pick at its failures, deceits and irrationalities. If only they were more reasonable, Obamacare could be tightened up around the edges with a few technocratic fixes and go on to its glorious destiny. \n \n (POLITICO's guide to Obamacare) \n \n It\u2019s a little late to get or expect any Republican buy-in, though. That would have required serious compromise back in 2009, when Democrats, at the high tide of their power in the Obama era, saw no reason to make any. They ignored the polls, they ignored Scott Brown\u2019s shocking win in Massachusetts, and they ignored normal parliamentary practices to pass the single most partisan piece of major social legislation in a century. \n \n They insisted on this particular law, at this particular time. They own it. They own every canceled policy, every rate increase, every unintended consequence and every unpopular intended consequence. It is theirs, lock, stock and two smoking barrels. \n \n But they can\u2019t stop whining. \n \n They complain that Republicans aren\u2019t as cooperative as they were when the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan had a rocky start. This is absurd. The Part D website experienced what could be accurately described as \u201cglitches,\u201d rather than the full meltdown of HealthCare.gov. And Democrats supported the basic idea of the prescription drug benefit, even if they wanted a more generous one. \n \n They complain that what they really wanted was single-payer, but had to settle for the unsatisfying second-best of Obamacare. Paul Krugman calls the health care law \u201ca clumsy, ugly structure that more or less deals with a problem, but in an inefficient way.\u201d (And he\u2019s a supporter!) The reason they couldn\u2019t get single-payer, though, is that there weren\u2019t enough Democratic votes for it. \n \n (PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes) \n \n They complain that Republicans are refusing, in the words of Washington Post blogger Greg Sargent, \u201cto have an actual debate about the law\u2019s trade-offs.\u201d This is especially rich given that the president has steadfastly refused to acknowledge some of the most significant trade-offs, namely that some people will lose their current insurance and have to pay more in the exchanges. \n \n Some liberal pundits have tiptoed around Obama\u2019s flat assurance about keeping your insurance if you like it. Sargent politely says it was \u201cnarrowly untrue,\u201d while Jonathan Cohn of The New Republic diplomatically says the president shouldn\u2019t have spoken \u201cin such clear-cut terms\u201d and Jonathan Chait subtly says it \u201ccurrently feels like a lie.\u201d \n \n Other commentators like Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune and Bill Maher of HBO frankly say the president lied. \n \n It is a falsity the White House doesn\u2019t want to give up. In a tweet heard around the world, White House aide Valerie Jarrett said it is a FACT that \u201cnothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans.\u201d Never mind that the entire architecture of the law is based on forcing people in the individual insurance market out of their current plans and onto the exchanges; that is how it\u2019s supposed to work and how it needs to work. \n \n (WATCH: 7 quotes on Obamacare glitches) \n \n In a characteristically graceless note, in his health care speech in Boston Wednesday President Obama didn\u2019t say anything about how his prior declarations had been misleading, at best. Instead, he tweaked his dishonesty for a different positive spin: \u201cFor the fewer than 5 percent of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal.\u201d Not if they are forced \u2014 as many of them will be \u2014 to buy benefits they don\u2019t need at a price they don\u2019t want to pay. \n \n From the beginning, Obamacare has depended on a political ethic of doing and saying whatever is necessary. The falsehood about people keeping their coverage was essential to selling the legislation. So the president repeated it relentlessly. Now that actually allowing people keep their current coverage would undermine a pillar of the law, the president will resist all efforts to make good on his famous promise. Whatever it takes. \n \n Near the end of his Boston remarks, the president said, \u201cBoth parties working together to get the job done, that\u2019s what we need in Washington right now \u2026 You know, if Republicans in Congress were as eager to help Americans get covered as some Republican governors have shown themselves to be, we\u2019d make a lot of progress.\u201d \n \n Is that how we\u2019d make a lot of progress? The president got his law and it\u2019s possible more people will be uninsured in 2014 than if it had never passed. That\u2019s on him, no matter how much he and his supporters want to evade responsibility for their own achievement. \n \n Rich Lowry is editor of National Review.",

    "document": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea said it successfully tested a powerful nuclear bomb on Wednesday, drawing threats of further sanctions even though the United States and weapons experts voiced doubts the device was as advanced as the isolated nation claimed. \n \n The underground explosion shook the earth so hard that it registered as a seismic event with U.S. earthquake monitors. It put pressure on China to rein in neighboring North Korea. \n \n The U.N. Security Council said it would begin working immediately on significant new measures in response to North Korea, a threat diplomats said could mean an expansion of sanctions. \n \n North Korea has been under Security Council sanctions since it first tested an atomic device in 2006. After a nuclear test in 2013, the Security Council took about three weeks to agree a resolution that tightened financial restrictions and cracked down on Pyongyang\u2019s attempts to ship and receive banned cargo. \n \n In the United States, Republican presidential candidates seized on the test to accuse President Barack Obama of running a \u201cfeckless\u201d foreign policy that enabled North Korea to bolster its nuclear arms capabilities. \n \n U.S. congressional sources said Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives were considering a vote as soon as next week to broaden sanctions against North Korea by imposing stiffer punishments on foreign companies doing business with Pyongyang. \n \n While North Korea has a long history of voicing bellicose rhetoric against the United States and its Asian allies without acting on it, the assertion by Pyongyang on Wednesday that it had tested a hydrogen device, much more powerful than an atomic bomb, came as a surprise. \n \n North Korea also said it was capable of miniaturizing the H-bomb, in theory allowing it to be placed on a missile and potentially posing a new threat to the U.S. West Coast, South Korea and Japan. \n \n The U.S. State Department confirmed North Korea had conducted a nuclear test but the Obama administration disputed the hydrogen bomb claim. \n \n \u201cThe initial analysis is not consistent with the claim the regime has made of a successful hydrogen bomb test,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. He said any nuclear test would be a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of Security Council resolutions. \n \n The explosion drew criticism, including from China and Russia. Beijing, the North\u2019s main economic and diplomatic backer, said it will lodge a protest with Pyongyang. \n \n \u2018H-BOMB OF JUSTICE\u2019 \n \n Wednesday\u2019s nuclear test took place two days ahead of what is believed to be North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s birthday. \n \n \u201cLet the world look up to the strong, self-reliant nuclear-armed state,\u201d Kim wrote in what North Korean state TV displayed as a handwritten note. \n \n North Korea called the device the \u201cH-bomb of justice.\u201d \n \n While the Kim government boasts of its military might to project strength globally, it also plays up the need to defend itself from external threats as a way to maintain control domestically. \n \n It will likely take several days to determine more precisely what kind of nuclear device Pyongyang set off as a variety of sensors, including \u201csniffer planes,\u201d collect evidence. \n \n Hydrogen bombs pack an explosion that can be more powerful than an atomic bomb as it uses a two-step process of fission and fusion that releases substantially more energy. \n \n Ko Yun-hwa (L), Administrator of Korea Meteorological Administration, points at where seismic waves observed in South Korea came from, during a media briefing at Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul, South Korea, January 6, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \n \n A U.S. government source said the United States believes North Korea had set off the latest in a series of tests of old-fashioned atomic bombs of which it has dozens. \n \n The source said the size of the latest explosion was roughly consistent with previous tests believed to have been conducted with A-bombs rather than H-bombs. The latest test occurred in the same geographical location, with the same geological profile, as earlier tests. \n \n The United States had been anticipating a North Korean nuclear test for some time, as intelligence surveillance produced indications of possible preparations, including evidence of new excavations of underground tunnels at the site. \n \n The USGS reported a 5.1 magnitude seismic event that South Korea said was 49 km (30 miles) from the Punggye-ri site where the North has conducted nuclear tests in the past. \n \n South Korean intelligence officials and several analysts also questioned whether Wednesday\u2019s explosion was a test of a full-fledged hydrogen device, pointing to its having been roughly as powerful as North Korea\u2019s last atomic test. \n \n Stocks across the world fell for a fifth consecutive day as the North Korea tension added to a growing list of geopolitical worries and China fueled fears about its economy by allowing the yuan to weaken further. \n \n The Republicans added North Korea to a list of what they assert are Obama\u2019s foreign policy failures, including Syria\u2019s civil war, the rise of Islamic State and the agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \n \n They also blamed his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party front-runner in the race for the November presidential election. \n \n Asked about North Korea, Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump told CNN that \u201cChina should solve that problem\u201d or face trade retaliation from the United States. \u201cSouth Korea should pay us and pay us very substantially for protecting them,\u201d he said. \n \n Clinton condemned North Korea\u2019s action as a \u201cdangerous and provocative act\u201d and said the United States should respond with more sanctions and stronger missile defenses. \n \n Slideshow (25 Images) \n \n North Korea has long coveted diplomatic recognition from Washington, but sees its nuclear deterrent as crucial to ensuring the survival of its third-generation dictatorship. \n \n The North\u2019s state news agency said Pyongyang would act as a responsible nuclear state and vowed not to use its nuclear weapons unless its sovereignty was infringed. \n \n Joe Cirincione, a nuclear expert who is president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security organization, said North Korea may have mixed a hydrogen isotope in a normal atomic fission bomb. \n \n \u201cBecause it is, in fact, hydrogen, they could claim it is a hydrogen bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not a true fusion bomb capable of the massive multi-megaton yields these bombs produce.\u201d ||||| North Korea carries out 'successful' hydrogen bomb test; 'Man-made earthquake' suspected after tremor \n \n Updated \n \n North Korea says it has conducted a \"successful\" hydrogen bomb test, which is believed to have caused a massive tremor that prompted evacuations as far away as China. \n \n Key points: North Korea claims to have successfully carried out its first hydrogen bomb test \n \n Magnitude-5.1 tremor at surface depth registered near Punggye-ri nuclear testing facility at 12:30pm AEDT \n \n The North has previously conducted tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 at location of latest tremor \n \n South Korea, US and Chinese authorities have scrambled for confirmation of the test, however officials in Seoul have cast doubt on the claim it was a hydrogen bomb saying no radiation had been detected. \n \n If confirmed, the explosion marks a major step forward in the country's nuclear development. \n \n The surprise test was personally ordered by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and came just two days before his birthday. \n \n \"Let the world look up to the strong, self-reliant nuclear-armed state,\" Mr Kim wrote in what North Korean state television displayed as a handwritten note. \n \n \"The republic's first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed ... based on the strategic determination of the Workers' Party,\" a news reader announced on Wednesday. \n \n \"With the perfect success of our historic H-bomb, we have joined the rank of advanced nuclear states. \n \n \"The latest test, completely based on our technology and our manpower, confirmed that our newly-developed technological resources are accurate and scientifically demonstrated the impact of our miniaturised H-bomb.\" \n \n A magnitude-5.1 tremor was earlier detected by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and South Korean officials said they suspected it was an explosion. \n \n H-bomb or A-bomb?

(ABC News) Simply put, atomic bombs' nuclear fission is the process of splitting atomic nuclei, while hydrogen bombs' fusion is joining them \n \n In H-bombs, TNT ignites an A-bomb to detonate adjacent to a fusion fuel such as tritium, deuterium or lithium deuteride, compressing them at extreme pressures and at a very rapid rate to start a fusion reaction \n \n Nuclear fusion is the process that occurs in the heart of the sun, and requires immense temperatures to ignite \n \n H-bombs, thermonuclear bombs and fusion bombs can be thousands of times more powerful than atomic bombs, atom bombs, A-bombs, or fission bombs \n \n Source: ABC/AFP \n \n Source: ABC/AFP \n \n \"We suspect a man-made earthquake, and are analysing the scale and epicentre of the quake with the geoscience and mineral resource institute of South Korea,\" a Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) official said. \n \n A revised location of the tremor by the USGS put it at the same location as previous tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and at surface depth. \n \n Chinese border residents, however, were evacuated from buildings after feeling the tremors, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said on a verified social media account. \n \n The areas included Yanji, Hunchun and Changbai in Jilin province, some of the counties closest to the North's nuclear test site. \n \n Students at a senior high school were dismissed during an examination after its recreation ground cracked, it added. \n \n Last month, Mr Kim suggested Pyongyang had already developed a hydrogen bomb, although the claim was greeted with scepticism by international experts. \n \n The North's miniaturisation claims have also not been independently verified. \n \n A hydrogen, or thermonuclear, device uses fusion in a chain reaction that results in a powerful explosion. \n \n Unexpected test draws immediate condemnation \n \n The nuclear test drew condemnation abroad, with China, the North's chief ally, expressing \"resolute opposition\" and saying it would lodge a protest with Pyongyang. \n \n The United Nations Security Council is planning to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday (New York time) to discuss the test, three council diplomats have said. \n \n It was not immediately clear what action, if any, the 15-nation council was planning to take in response to the statement. \n \n Analysis: North Asia correspondent Matthew Carney in Beijing \n \n The last bomb, in 2013, was about magnitude 4.9 on the Richter scale. This time, it was only 5.1. \n \n \n \n Experts have said if this really was a true H-bomb, then you could expect up to 10 times this on the Richter scale, which obviously leads us to two conclusions. \n \n \n \n One, the regime is actually lying about it. A couple of weeks ago, we had North Korea's leaders saying that they would do it and that they did have the capacity, so maybe he is carrying on that threat. \n \n \n \n Or secondly and probably more likely, it was perhaps a failure to ignite this H-bomb and start this two-stage thermonuclear process. \n \n \n \n What they are trying to do is miniaturise the technology, to put the device on top of their inter-continental ballistic missiles, to hit the coast of America. \n \n \n \n This is the fourth test and in 10 years, they're really just still at the stage of a Hiroshima-style bomb that America dropped in Japan. \n \n Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has called on international bodies, including the council, to provide a strong response to North Korea's actions. \n \n \"[The] nuclear test confirms North Korea's status as a rogue state and a continuing threat to international peace and security,\" Ms Bishop's statement said. \n \n While vowing to stick by a no-first-use policy, North Korea said it would continue to pursue an advanced nuclear strike capability. \n \n \"As long as the vicious anti-North policy of the US persists, we will never stop development of our nuclear program,\" its state television news reader said. \n \n The White House said it could not confirm the claims of miniaturisation and a hydrogen bomb test, but added the United States would respond appropriately to provocations and defend its allies. \n \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would make a firm response to North Korea's challenge against nuclear non-proliferation. \n \n \"North Korea's nuclear test is a serious threat to our nation's security and we absolutely cannot tolerate it,\" Mr Abe told reporters. \n \n \"We strongly denounce it.\" \n \n South Korea's intelligence agency said the device may not have been a hydrogen nuclear bomb, Yonhap news agency reported. \n \n Its meteorological agency said separately that it had not detected any radiation. \n \n In Seoul, the presidential Blue House called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council as officials scrambled to confirm the precise nature of the tremor. \n \n South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the country will take decisive measures against any additional provocations by the North, and work with the international community to make sure the isolated country pays the price for its latest nuclear test. \n \n China's Xinhua state news agency said a new test runs counter to the goal of denuclearisation, and warned that any practice that disrupts stability in northeast Asia is \"undesirable and unwise\". \n \n A nuclear test is as a major slap in the face to its chief ally China, and extinguishes any chance of a resumption of six-country talks on North Korea's nuclear program that Beijing has been pushing for. \n \n ABC/wires \n \n Topics: nuclear-issues, earthquake, korea-democratic-peoples-republic-of, asia \n \n First posted ||||| SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea said Wednesday it had conducted a powerful hydrogen bomb test, a defiant and surprising move that, if confirmed, would be a huge jump in Pyongyang's quest to improve its still-limited nuclear arsenal. \n \n People watch a TV news program showing North Korea's announcement, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2016.

South Korean officials detected an \"artificial... (Associated Press) \n \n A television anchor said in a typically propaganda-heavy statement that the North had tested a \"miniaturized\" hydrogen bomb, elevating the country's \"nuclear might to the next level\" and providing it with a weapon to defend against the United States and its other enemies. \n \n The statement said the test was a \"perfect success,\" and the announcement was celebrated on the streets of Pyongyang. \n \n South Korean President Park Geun-hye ordered her military to bolster its combined defense posture with U.S. forces and called the test a \"grave provocation\" and \"an act that threatens our lives and future.\" \n \n There has long been skepticism by Washington and nuclear experts about past North Korean claims about H-bombs, which are much more powerful, and much more difficult to make, than atomic bombs. A confirmed test, however, would be seen as extremely worrying and lead to a strong push for new, tougher sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations, which quickly announced an emergency Security Council meeting on North Korea. It would also further worsen already abysmal relations between Pyongyang and its neighbors. \n \n North Korean nuclear tests catch global attention because each new blast is seen as pushing North Korea's scientists and engineers closer to their goal of building a bomb small enough to place on a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. \n \n A successful H-bomb test would be a big step for the North, and the announcement prompted skepticism. Fusion is the main principle behind the hydrogen bomb, which can be hundreds of times more powerful than atomic weapons that use fission. In a hydrogen bomb, radiation from a nuclear fission explosion sets off a fusion reaction responsible for a powerful blast and radioactivity. \n \n Writing in December, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un bragged of H-bomb capabilities, nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis noted that building such a bomb \"would seem to be a bit of a stretch for the North Koreans.\" \n \n But, he wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website, \"The North has now had a nuclear weapons program for more than 20 years. This program has yielded three nuclear tests. North Korean nuclear scientists have access to their counterparts in Pakistan, possibly Iran and maybe a few other places. We should not expect that they will test the same fission device over and over again.\" \n \n One expert in Seoul said the 5.1 magnitude of the quake set off by Wednesday's test was likely too small to be an H-bomb test. However, the North could have experimented with a \"boosted\" bomb that uses some nuclear fusion fuel along with more conventional uranium or plutonium fuel, said Jaiki Lee, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul's Hanyang University. \n \n In Pyongyang, meanwhile, the announcement was greeted with an expected rush of nationalistic pride, and some bewilderment. \n \n A large crowd gathered in front of the city's main train station to watch the special bulletin announcing the news of the test on a big screen in the station's plaza. Some took videos or photos of the screen on their mobile phones. Others applauded and cheered as the TV announcer, wearing a pink traditional Korean gown, announced the news. \n \n One of the people in the plaza, Kim Sok Chol, 32, told The Associated Press that he doesn't know much about H-bombs, but added that \"Since we have it the U.S. will not attack us.\" \n \n University student Ri Sol Yong, 22, said, \"If we didn't have powerful nuclear weapons, we would already have been turned into the slaves of the U.S.\" \n \n Just how big a threat North Korea's nuclear program currently poses to the outside world is something of a mystery. North Korea is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs and has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range missile to eventually carry smaller versions of those bombs. \n \n Some analysts say the North hasn't likely achieved the technology needed to manufacture a miniaturized warhead that could fit on a long-range missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. But there is a growing debate on just how far the North has advanced in its secretive nuclear and missile programs. \n \n North Korea needs nuclear tests for practical military reasons. To build a credible nuclear program, the North must explode new nuclear devices \u2014 including miniaturized ones \u2014 so its scientists can continually improve their designs and technology. Nuclear-tipped missiles could then be used as deterrents, and diplomatic bargaining chips, against its enemies \u2014 and especially against the United States, which Pyongyang has long pushed to withdraw its troops from the region and to sign a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. \n \n Strong condemnation of the announced test rolled in from around the world, including from Lassina Zerbo, the head of the Vienna-based CTBTO, which has a worldwide network of monitoring stations to detect nuclear testing. Zerbo told AP by phone, \"This is indeed a wakeup call ... and I am convinced it will have repercussions on North Korea and international peace and stability.\" \n \n On Wednesday, the first indication of a possible test came when the U.S. Geological Survey measured an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1. An official from the Korea Metrological Administration, South Korea's weather agency, said the agency believed the earthquake was caused artificially, based on an analysis of the seismic waves; it originated 49 kilometers (30 miles) north of Kilju, the northeastern area where North Korea's main nuclear test site is located. The country conducted all three previous atomic detonations there. \n \n The announcement came as a surprise. \n \n North Korea hadn't conducted a nuclear explosion since early 2013, and leader Kim Jong Un did not mention the country's nuclear weapons in his New Year's speech. Some outside analysts speculated that Kim was worried about deteriorating ties with China, the North's last major ally, which has shown signs of greater frustration at provocations and a possible willingness to allow stronger U.N. sanctions. \n \n Pyongyang says its nuclear weapons program is necessary to defend itself against the United States. North Korea under Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy. \n \n Washington sees North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as a threat to world security and to its Asian allies, Japan and South Korea. \n \n The Korean Peninsula remains technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice. Washington stations more than 28,000 troops in South Korea as a buttress against any North Korean aggression. Tens of thousands more are in nearby Japan. \n \n The test announcement comes amid failed diplomatic efforts to persuade the North to give up its nuclear ambitions. Six-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid were last held in late 2008 and fell apart in early 2009, when North Korea was led by Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, who died in late 2011. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writer Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul and George Jahn in Vienna contributed to this story. \n \n Follow Foster Klug on Twitter: @APKlug ||||| North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gives a new year\u2019s address for 2016 in Pyongyang, in this photo released Friday. (Kyodo/Reuters) \n \n North Korea claimed Wednesday that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, a claim that, if true, would mark a huge step forward in its nuclear capability. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve carried out a hydrogen bomb test,\u201d a newsreader on the state-run Korean Central Television station announced in a special broadcast from Pyongyang. \n \n \u201cNorth Korea was forced to develop its nuclear arsenal because of the U.S.\u2019s hostile policy against North Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, as a peaceful nation and a nuclear powered-nation, North Korea will be a responsible state and will not use its nuclear power before [an attack] and will not transfer the technology to others.\u201d \n \n There was some skepticism about the claim, with nuclear experts noting that the yield appeared to be similar to North Korea\u2019s three previous atomic tests, rather than the \u201cenormous\u201d yield that would be expected if it had been a thermonuclear test. \n \n \u201cWe are aware of seismic activity on the Korean Peninsula in the vicinity of a known North Korean nuclear test site and have seen Pyongyang\u2019s claims of a nuclear test,\u201d said John Kirby, a spokesman at the State Department. \u201cWe are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n Either way, Pyongyang\u2019s provocative action will present a new challenge to the outside world, which has struggled to find ways to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear defiance. \n \n \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s fourth test \u2014 in the context of repeated statements by U.S., Chinese, and South Korean leaders \u2014 throws down the gauntlet to the international community to go beyond paper resolutions and find a way to impose real costs on North Korea for pursuing this course of action,\u201d said Scott Snyder, a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \n \n Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime hinted in December that it had built a hydrogen bomb to \u201cdefend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation.\u201d Some analysts were doubtful, saying the young leader appeared primarily concerned with trying to bolster his legitimacy. \n \n But on Wednesday, North Korea said in a special broadcast that it had carried out a \u201csuccessful\u201d hydrogen bomb test. \u201cWith this hydrogen bomb test, we have joined the major nuclear powers,\u201d the newsreader said. \n \n Hydrogen, or thermonuclear, bombs are exponentially more powerful and destructive than atomic devices. An atomic bomb uses fission to break up the atomic nucleus and release energy, while a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb uses fusion to add to the nucleus. This leads to an enormous explosion resulting from an uncontrolled, self-sustaining chain reaction. \n \n Kim has repeatedly asserted North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear-armed country and has resolutely refused to return to multilateral talks aimed at persuading it to abandon its nuclear weapons program. \n \n North Korea had conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 but only one during Kim\u2019s reign, in February 2013.To the surprise of many analysts, there had been no fourth test. \n \n Then, there were signs of unusual seismic activity around North Korea\u2019s main nuclear test site Wednesday morning, sparking fears that Pyongyang ordered the detonation of another atomic device two days before Kim\u2019s birthday. \n \n \u201cWe have consistently made clear that we will not accept [North Korea] as a nuclear state,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe will continue to protect and defend our allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea, and will respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations.\u201d \n \n Earthquake agencies in China, Japan and the United States all recorded unusual seismic activity in the northeastern corner of North Korea at 10 a.m. local time Wednesday. \n \n The U.S. Geological Survey recorded a shallow 5.1-magnitude quake about 20 miles from the facility at Punggye-ri, where North Korea has carried out its three previous nuclear tests. Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency said that it appeared to be some kind of artificial explosion and that the waveform was very similar to the ones detected at the past nuclear tests, public broadcaster NHK reported. \n \n Many analysts have been surprised that such a long period has passed without another test, because it is by testing that North Korea can advance its program. \n \n \u201cI think they have a technological path in mind,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif. \n \n In December, Lewis noted that satellite pictures showed North Korea appeared to be building a new tunnel at its nuclear test site, warning that the Pyongyang regime might be preparing to conduct a fourth atomic test. \u201cThere is a lot of tunneling at the test site, which could mean they have a bunch of tests planned,\u201d he said. \n \n Although analysts were still awaiting more data, Lewis said that Wednesday\u2019s explosion looked very similar to past tests and was not enormous, suggesting it was not a hydrogen bomb. \n \n In Seoul and Tokyo, the governments called emergency national security meetings to discuss the possibility of a nuclear test. \n \n \u201cThis nuclear test by North Korea is a major threat to our country\u2019s security, and I absolutely cannot accept it,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAlso, it is clearly a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions so . . . we will take strong measure, including steps within the U.N. Security Council.\u201d \n \n Joel Wit, a former U.S. diplomat who runs the 38 North website dedicated to North Korea, said that the purpose of the test remained unclear. \n \n \u201cWhat is clear is that North Korea is moving forward with its nuclear weapons program and that the United States, China and the international community need to come up with more effective ways to deal with this growing threat,\u201d he said. \n \n Yoonjung Seo in Seoul and Yuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

    "document": "1. Introduction \n \n On 18 October 2009, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA) opened an exhibition called The Secrets of Tomb 10A: Egypt 2000 BC . One of the most intriguing items in the collection was a mummified human head discovered over a century ago in the necropolis of Deir el-Bersha (also known as Dayr al-Barsh\u0101). The site is located on the east bank of the Nile River in close proximity to the city of Mallawi, approximately 250 km south of Cairo. Deir el-Bersha is known for tombs cut into cliffs of limestone that date back to the Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC), the First Intermediate Period (about 2100\u20132040 BC) and the Middle Kingdom (MK; 2040\u2013approx. 1640 BC). During the MK 11th and 12th Dynasties (2040\u20131783 BC), it served as the chief cemetery for the governors or regional lords (a.k.a. nomarchs) of the 15th Upper Egyptian Nome (a.k.a. the Hare Nome). \n \n 2, In 1915, Deir el-Bersha was excavated by a joint MFA-Harvard University team directed by George A. Reisner with the assistance of Hanford L. Story and Said Ahmed Said [ 1 ]. On 23 April, Reisner\u2019s men began clearing the burial shaft from tomb number 10A. Six days later, at the bottom of a 30-foot pit, they discovered the burial chamber of an early MK governor named Djehutynakht. It is not yet clear whether he is Djehutynakht IV, son of Ahanakht I, or Djehutynakht V, son of Nehri I [ 1 3 ]. Both were nomarchs of the Hare Nome, and while they shared the same name (which means Thoth [the main local deity] is Strong), there is no evidence they were related. Tomb 10A contained a second occupant: the governor\u2019s wife, who was also called Djehutynakht. Although the tomb had been plundered in antiquity and most of the valuable jewels stolen, many objects were left behind. In fact, the recovered contents of Tomb 10A are considered one of the largest burial assemblages of the MK ever discovered. The funerary equipment includes pottery, canopic jars, models showing men and women in different daily life activities, nearly 60 model boats, and a famous, exquisitely carved and painted processional group composed of a priest and four offering bearers, known as the \u201cBersha procession\u201d [ 4 ]. Befitting their high status, the governor and his wife were both buried in finely decorated rectangular wooden coffins placed within larger coffins, all made of thick cedar of Lebanon boards. Upon discovery, the coffins of the governor were nearly intact with the exception of the head end that had been removed by tomb robbers. The intricate carvings and paintings on the governor\u2019s outer coffin make it an unparalleled masterpiece of MK art (see pictures in [ 5 ]). \n \n When the tomb was looted, the mummies of the governor and his wife were damaged by thieves in search of fine jewelry. A torso, originally attributed to Lady Djehutynakht, was found in the far corner of the burial chamber, but was recently argued to belong to the governor after re-excavation of Tomb 10A [ 6 ]. A mummified head, which could neither be attributed to the governor nor to his wife, was found atop the governor\u2019s coffin ( Figure 1 ). \n \n In an effort to learn more, the head was analyzed with computerized tomography (CT) in 2005. The CT scanning of the head revealed extensive bilateral post-mortem alterations of the facial bones [ 7 ]. The absence of these bones, together with the lack of comparative data on ancient Egyptian skulls, preclude definitive morphological sex determination; however, the presence of large mastoid processes, robust occipital and temporal regions, and pronounced gonial flaring of the mandible, suggest that the skull more likely belonged to a man [ 8 ], ( Figure S1 ). In order to unequivocally determine the biological sex of the individual, the MFA collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory to perform DNA analysis. \n \n At the time the FBI was contacted, the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing of ancient Egyptian human remains. Though DNA extraction and amplification from ancient Egyptian samples had been attempted in the early days of paleogenetics, these initial attempts either resulted in failure (4500-year-old human femurs [ 9 ]) or yielded data that turned out to be the product of modern DNA contamination (2400-year-old mummy [ 10 ] and 1600-year-old sacred monkey bones from the Saqqara Baboon Galleries [ 11 ]), both contaminated with modern human DNA). These early failures prompted studies on DNA survival [ 9 12 ]. Together with older research showing that DNA degradation (depurination in particular) is primarily influenced by temperature, pH, oxygen, and water [ 13 ], these analyses suggested that Egyptian environmental conditions likely cause DNA to degrade to fragments smaller than 100 base pairs (bp) in just a few hundred years [ 14 15 ]. \n \n Currently, forensic DNA testing at the FBI, as well as in nearly all global operational laboratories, is based on targeted PCR amplification of fragments ranging from 90\u20131200 bp in size, followed by size-based capillary electrophoresis for short tandem repeats (STRs) or Sanger sequencing for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These approaches have served the forensic community well over the past twenty years. They present limitations, however, to both the quality and quantity of genetic data that can be recovered from the most challenging specimens. Recently, a number of commercial high throughput sequencing (HTS) assays, designed specifically for forensic applications, have become available [ 16 17 ]. While these assays overcome many of the limitations of traditional capillary electrophoresis-based forensic DNA analyses, they are still based on targeted amplification of defined genomic regions. As a result, their utility is limited to samples harboring DNA fragments large enough for PCR amplification. \n \n One of the primary advantages of HTS is that DNA fragments of very short size can be recovered and sequenced, thus obviating the need for targeted PCR. Here, we exploit this feature and describe the use of shotgun sequencing to determine the biological sex of a 4000-year-old Egyptian mummy. ||||| If the F.B.I.'s scientists could extract DNA from the 4,000-year-old mummy, they would add a powerful tool to their forensics arsenal and also unlock a new way of deciphering Egypt\u2019s ancient past https://t.co/a1em2dIpBG \u2014 NYT Science (@NYTScience) April 2, 2018 \n \n A team of forensic scientists has managed to extract DNA from a 4,000-year-old mummy, and their finding has solved a century-old mystery of its ransacked tomb. \n \n The Egyptian mummy wasn't a fully preserved corpse, but rather a decapitated, mutilated, bandage-wrapped head that archaeologists found on top of a coffin when they excavated a tomb back in 1915. And that was the source of the mystery. \n \n As the researchers explained in a paper published March 1 in the journal Genes, the tomb belonged to an Egyptian Middle Kingdom governor named Djehutynakht. But by the time modern scientists found the tomb, it had been ransacked; it was robbed in ancient times. In an article describing the discovery, The New York Times reported that the robbers had set the place on fire \"to cover their tracks.\" [Gallery: Amazing Egyptian Discoveries] \n \n All that remained of the tomb's occupants was a dismembered torso in one corner of the tomb and a head placed on top of Djehutynakht's coffin. For more than a hundred years, researchers have wondered and disagreed about whether these mummified remains belonged to Djehutynakht himself or to his wife. \n \n Deepening the mystery, the head had been altered during the mummification process, with several bones removed from the jaw and cheek in an effort to enable the deceased to eat and drink in the afterlife, the Times reported. Those bones might have offered clues as to whether the body was male or female. \n \n That left DNA analysis. But extracting DNA from ancient Egyptian mummies, after centuries in hot, DNA-degrading environments, had never been achieved before. The Times reported that earlier attempts failed or produced contaminated results. \n \n This is a good article by @SciFleur . You should read it. \n \n \n \n But I can't be the only person who looks at this picture of the mummy's head and kind of sees a roast chicken. \n \n \n \n Sorry (not sorry).https://t.co/28hbBGLeCe pic.twitter.com/AJjznpfodi \u2014 Kendra \"Gloom is My Beat\" Pierre-Louis (@KendraWrites) April 2, 2018 \n \n Still, FBI forensic researchers gave it a shot. They had access because the head, along with many artifacts from the tomb, had long since made its way to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. (Shipping artifacts out of Egypt would be illegal today under Egyptian law.) They drilled into a molar extracted from the head \"in pristine condition\" back in 2009, producing 105 milligrams (0.004 ounces) of tooth dust.

Introduction \n \n On 18 October 2009, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA) opened an exhibition called The Secrets of Tomb 10A: Egypt 2000 BC . One of the most intriguing items in the collection was a mummified human head discovered over a century ago in the necropolis of Deir el-Bersha (also known as Dayr al-Barsh\u0101). The site is located on the east bank of the Nile River in close proximity to the city of Mallawi, approximately 250 km south of Cairo. Deir el-Bersha is known for tombs cut into cliffs of limestone that date back to the Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC), the First Intermediate Period (about 2100\u20132040 BC) and the Middle Kingdom (MK; 2040\u2013approx. 1640 BC). During the MK 11th and 12th Dynasties (2040\u20131783 BC), it served as the chief cemetery for the governors or regional lords (a.k.a. nomarchs) of the 15th Upper Egyptian Nome (a.k.a. the Hare Nome). \n \n 2, In 1915, Deir el-Bersha was excavated by a joint MFA-Harvard University team directed by George A. Reisner with the assistance of Hanford L. Story and Said Ahmed Said [ 1 ]. On 23 April, Reisner\u2019s men began clearing the burial shaft from tomb number 10A. Six days later, at the bottom of a 30-foot pit, they discovered the burial chamber of an early MK governor named Djehutynakht. It is not yet clear whether he is Djehutynakht IV, son of Ahanakht I, or Djehutynakht V, son of Nehri I [ 1 3 ]. Both were nomarchs of the Hare Nome, and while they shared the same name (which means Thoth [the main local deity] is Strong), there is no evidence they were related. Tomb 10A contained a second occupant: the governor\u2019s wife, who was also called Djehutynakht. Although the tomb had been plundered in antiquity and most of the valuable jewels stolen, many objects were left behind. In fact, the recovered contents of Tomb 10A are considered one of the largest burial assemblages of the MK ever discovered. The funerary equipment includes pottery, canopic jars, models showing men and women in different daily life activities, nearly 60 model boats, and a famous, exquisitely carved and painted processional group composed of a priest and four offering bearers, known as the \u201cBersha procession\u201d [ 4 ]. Befitting their high status, the governor and his wife were both buried in finely decorated rectangular wooden coffins placed within larger coffins, all made of thick cedar of Lebanon boards. Upon discovery, the coffins of the governor were nearly intact with the exception of the head end that had been removed by tomb robbers. The intricate carvings and paintings on the governor\u2019s outer coffin make it an unparalleled masterpiece of MK art (see pictures in [ 5 ]). \n \n When the tomb was looted, the mummies of the governor and his wife were damaged by thieves in search of fine jewelry. A torso, originally attributed to Lady Djehutynakht, was found in the far corner of the burial chamber, but was recently argued to belong to the governor after re-excavation of Tomb 10A [ 6 ]. A mummified head, which could neither be attributed to the governor nor to his wife, was found atop the governor\u2019s coffin ( Figure 1 ). \n \n In an effort to learn more, the head was analyzed with computerized tomography (CT) in 2005. The CT scanning of the head revealed extensive bilateral post-mortem alterations of the facial bones [ 7 ]. The absence of these bones, together with the lack of comparative data on ancient Egyptian skulls, preclude definitive morphological sex determination; however, the presence of large mastoid processes, robust occipital and temporal regions, and pronounced gonial flaring of the mandible, suggest that the skull more likely belonged to a man [ 8 ], ( Figure S1 ). In order to unequivocally determine the biological sex of the individual, the MFA collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory to perform DNA analysis. \n \n At the time the FBI was contacted, the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing of ancient Egyptian human remains. Though DNA extraction and amplification from ancient Egyptian samples had been attempted in the early days of paleogenetics, these initial attempts either resulted in failure (4500-year-old human femurs [ 9 ]) or yielded data that turned out to be the product of modern DNA contamination (2400-year-old mummy [ 10 ] and 1600-year-old sacred monkey bones from the Saqqara Baboon Galleries [ 11 ]), both contaminated with modern human DNA). These early failures prompted studies on DNA survival [ 9 12 ]. Together with older research showing that DNA degradation (depurination in particular) is primarily influenced by temperature, pH, oxygen, and water [ 13 ], these analyses suggested that Egyptian environmental conditions likely cause DNA to degrade to fragments smaller than 100 base pairs (bp) in just a few hundred years [ 14 15 ]. \n \n Currently, forensic DNA testing at the FBI, as well as in nearly all global operational laboratories, is based on targeted PCR amplification of fragments ranging from 90\u20131200 bp in size, followed by size-based capillary electrophoresis for short tandem repeats (STRs) or Sanger sequencing for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These approaches have served the forensic community well over the past twenty years. They present limitations, however, to both the quality and quantity of genetic data that can be recovered from the most challenging specimens. Recently, a number of commercial high throughput sequencing (HTS) assays, designed specifically for forensic applications, have become available [ 16 17 ]. While these assays overcome many of the limitations of traditional capillary electrophoresis-based forensic DNA analyses, they are still based on targeted amplification of defined genomic regions. As a result, their utility is limited to samples harboring DNA fragments large enough for PCR amplification. \n \n One of the primary advantages of HTS is that DNA fragments of very short size can be recovered and sequenced, thus obviating the need for targeted PCR. Here, we exploit this feature and describe the use of shotgun sequencing to determine the biological sex of a 4000-year-old Egyptian mummy.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It has to rank among the less usual undertakings doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital had attempted: In 2009 they removed a molar from a severed Egyptian mummy's head via an endoscope with grasping forceps they inserted through the neck. The tooth was a hopeful clue in a nearly century-old mystery\u2014one that still wouldn't be solved for years to come. The head (see it here) was discovered in 1915 in Deir el-Bersha, south of Cairo, in a room built for a governor named Djehutynakht and his wife 4,000 years ago. It had been looted by grave robbers, and the identity of the head\u2014was it Djehutynakht's or his wife's?\u2014remained unclear. A DNA test could provide the answer, but no mummy of that age had given up usable, reliable DNA, and \"the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing\" of such remains, per a report in the journal Genes. The molar was their best bet, and scientists tried and failed to get it to give up its DNA. Then, in 2016, the tooth made its way to the FBI's Dr. Odile Loreille, a forensic scientist with a long history of working with old and ancient DNA; the New York Times reports she has identified Korean War victims, a 2-year-old who died on the Titanic, and the remains of two children of Russian Tsar Nicholas II. She managed to retrieve a tiny bit of powder\u2014just 0.004 ounces, per LiveScience\u2014from the tooth's core, and the ratio of chromosomes it contained proved it was male DNA: Governor Djehutynakht. The Times sums up the significance: \"In doing so she had help[ed] establish that ancient Egyptian DNA could be extracted from mummies.\" (This Egyptian coffin is \"dowdy,\" but the inside is astonishing.)",

Harvard researchers now think they've figured it out. Using CT scans of the head and facial bones, they report in the journal Scientific Reports that \"the absence of these bones, together with the lack of comparative data on ancient Egyptian skulls, precluded definitive morphological sex determination; however, the presence of large mastoid processes, robust occipital and temporal regions, and pronounced gonial flaring of the mandible, suggest that the skull more likely belonged to a person.\" They believe it's likely a man named Djehutynakht, who was governor of the 15th Upper Egyptian Nome and whose tomb was found in Deir el-Bersha, reports the New York Times. A torso found in the same dig is believed to belong to his wife, but a CT scan in 2005 suggested it was a woman, not a man. The skull \"has the same features as a man as far as the facial bones are concerned, but the differences are much more pronounced,\" lead researcher Dr. George Reisner says in a Harvard press release. \"The differences suggest that \u2013 A mummified head discovered in a tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings more than 4,000 years ago belonged to a man, according to a study published Wednesday in PLOS One.

The study \u2013 In 1915, archaeologists discovered a ransacked tomb in Egypt that belonged to an Egyptian Middle Kingdom governor named Djehutynakht. The tomb had been set on fire \"to cover their tracks,\" the New York Times reported at the time, and all that was left of it was a dismembered torso and a decapitated, bandage-wrapped head that had been placed on top of the coffin. For more than a century, researchers have been unable to determine whether the remains belonged to the man or his wife, and now, for the first time, forensic scientists have been able to extract DNA from the mummified remains and solve the century-old mystery, Live Science reports. In a paper published March 1 in the journal Genes, researchers explain that they extracted DNA from a molar extracted from the head \"in pristine condition\" in 2009 by drilling into it and using a liquid mixture designed to copy and amplify existing DNA. They found that it came from a biological male and not his wife. A team at the Department of Homeland Security, working with a smaller tooth-dust sample, later confirmed the results.

AP's earlier story is below. \n \n A judge planned to announce his verdict Sunday in the case of two high school football players charged with raping a 16-year-old girl after an alcohol-fueled party last summer. \n \n Prosecutors say the drunken girl was taken advantage of and treated like a toy. Defense attorneys counter that the girl has a history of heavy drinking and telling lies. \n \n Testimony concluded Saturday night with the accuser recalling that she drank at a party in August but couldn't remember what had happened when she awoke the next day naked in a strange house. \n \n Testimony in the four-day nonjury trial against Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond ended after the judge heard from the 16-year-old West Virginia girl and others in the juvenile court case. \n \n If found delinquent _ the juvenile court equivalent of guilty _ the two defendants could be jailed until they turn 21, when they would be released. \n \n Mays, 17, and Richmond, 16, are charged with digitally penetrating the girl, first in a car and then in the basement of a house, while out partying Aug. 12. Mays also is charged with illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. They maintain their innocence. \n \n The case has riveted the small city of Steubenville amid allegations that more students should have been charged and has led to questions about the influence of the popular football team, a source of pride in a community that suffered massive job losses with the collapse of the steel industry. \n \n On the stand Saturday, the girl said she remembers drinking at the party, leaving the party holding hands with Mays, then throwing up later. The next thing she remembers is waking up with no clothes on in a strange house, she said. She said she felt scared and embarrassed. Her phone, earrings, shoes and underwear were missing, she testified. \n \n The accuser said she believed she was assaulted when she later read text messages among friends, saw a photo of herself from that night and watched a YouTube video in which a student cracks jokes about the alleged rape just hours afterward. She said she suspected she had been drugged because she couldn't explain being as intoxicated as defense witnesses have said she was. \n \n The girl testified in a quiet, sometimes hesitant voice, and broke down only once: when prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter showed her a second photo of herself naked that she hadn't seen. \n \n Richmond observed the girl carefully as she spoke, while Mays, as he often did during the trial, fidgeted, appearing not to focus on any one thing in the courtroom. \n \n Prosecutors told the judge in closing arguments that the evidence was overwhelming. Defense attorneys argued that prosecutors hadn't proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \n Earlier Saturday, defense attorneys went after the accuser's character, calling two former friends of hers to the stand. They testified that the girl had a history of drinking heavily and was known to lie about things. \n \n West Virginia high school student Kelsey Weaver said the accuser told her what happened two days after the party, then, sometime afterward, told Weaver she couldn't remember what had happened. \n \n Earlier, Weaver testified that the accuser was flirting at the party with Richmond. \n \n Both Weaver and schoolmate Gianna Anile testified they were angry at the accuser because she was drinking heavily at the party and rolling around on the floor. They said they tried unsuccessfully to get her to stop drinking. \n \n Anile said she also tried to get her friend to stay at the party rather than leave with others, including the two defendants. \n \n The day after the party, when Anile and another friend picked up the accuser from the house where she'd stayed, the accuser said she had no memory of the night before, Anile testified. \n \n The accuser said in her later testimony that she doesn't remember making that statement or being photographed as she was carried by Mays and Richmond, an image that stirred up the community as it spread on social media sites. Others have testified the photo was a joke and the girl was conscious when it was taken. \n \n Testimony Friday from three teenage boys granted immunity from prosecution incriminated the defendants. \n \n The Associated Press normally doesn't identify minors charged in juvenile court, but Mays and Richmond have been widely identified in news coverage, and their names have been used in open court. The AP also doesn't generally identify people who say they were victims of sex crimes. \n \n ___ \n \n Andrew Welsh-Huggins can be reached at https://twitter.com/awhcolumbus.",

Judge Thomas Lipps ruled that Steubenville High School football players Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'Lik Richmond, 16, are guilty of digitally penetrating the girl after a booze-fueled party in August. A state prosecutor asked for a harsh sentence for the boys, citing an \"absolute lack of remorse\" the pair had demonstrated. Loud sobs were heard in the courtroom after the verdict was read.

Depending on their behavior, they could remain there until they are 21.

    "document": "Sampling Framework \n \n We conducted a randomized survey of 3299 households from January 17 through February 24, 2018. The target sample of approximately 3000 households was calculated to detect a 50% increase in the annual mortality rate from a historic (September 20 through December 31) baseline rate of 8 per 1000,21 with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05. To ensure sampling of households across geographic regions, we stratified the population according to remoteness, defined according to the travel time to the nearest city with a population of at least 50,000 persons.22,23 We determined an average remoteness index for each of the 900 barrios (administrative units) by using population and road-network data from official government sources.24 Barrios were grouped into eight categories according to percentile from least remote (category 1) to most remote (category 8), and 13 barrios were randomly sampled from each category (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). We randomly sampled an additional barrio from each of the two inhabited island municipalities off the northeast coast, Vieques and Culebra, and excluded largely uninhabited barrios such as nature reserves. \n \n We randomly selected 35 households from each barrio using OpenStreetMap (OSM) layers to identify buildings.25 When data collectors encountered an abandoned home or nonhome structure, they sampled a house from all surrounding visible houses using a random number generator. The same process was followed if consent was declined, if the house was empty at the time of the interview, or when sparsely populated barrios had fewer than 35 points sampled because of incomplete data structures on OSM. Our survey logistics did not allow for the data collectors to revisit an empty house (see the Supplementary Appendix for details). \n \n Data collectors did not record any personal identifiers; global positioning system (GPS) coordinates were aggregated after data collection. To avoid coercion and reduce bias, no compensation was provided. The participants were informed that their responses would not result in direct benefits to them or their families. If respondents requested health services, data collectors provided information on accessible resources identified by local partners. Consent for participation was acquired before administration of the survey. This study was granted a human subjects research exemption (45CFR46) by the institutional review board of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \n \n Household Survey \n \n We used a hybrid census method, collecting information about each household member, including all persons who had moved in, moved out, been born, or died in 2017.26 Persons who were reported to be missing from households, but not known to be deceased, were considered to be alive for our calculations. Households were defined as a person or a group of persons, related or unrelated, who live together. The survey was administered to one adult respondent per household and took less than 10 minutes to complete. The survey instrument is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The survey included questions on age, sex, cause of death if after the hurricane, hurricane-related migration, neighborhood deaths, and access to electricity, water, and cellular network coverage on an ordinal scale for each month (0 days, 1 to 7 days, 8 to 14, 15 to 30 days, or all month). \n \n Population Estimation \n \n Survey weights (w) were constructed by calculating the inverse probability of selection of a household and were defined as \n \n and \n \n We used the following formulas to calculate the general population estimate: \n \n and \n \n where i is the household. Weights and estimates of excess deaths were constructed with the use of the most recent official population estimate in 2016.27 \n \n Statistical Analysis \n \n To estimate excess deaths, we estimated the mortality rate after the hurricane (from September 20 through December 31, 2017) and compared it with the official mortality rate for the same period in 2016, since mortality rates showed seasonal but stable trends from 2010 through 2016 (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Official monthly mortality data for 2016 were obtained from the Department of Health 2016 mortality data provided by the Institute of Statistics of Puerto Rico.28 We computed our rate without applying survey weights, since we observed no remoteness category\u2013specific clustering of deaths (see the Supplementary Appendix for further discussion). The post-hurricane unweighted crude mortality rate (R after ), estimated from our survey, was therefore defined as \n \n where 102 is the number of days between September 20 and December 31, and R before is the unweighted crude mortality rate in 2017 before September 20. The standard error for R after was estimated from our survey: \n \n We assumed deaths were Poisson distributed, and we calculated the corresponding 95% confidence interval assuming the rate would be large enough that we could assume the normal approximation for the Poisson distribution: ||||| Study Puts Puerto Rico Death Toll From Hurricane Maria Near 5,000 \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images \n \n Updated 12:43 p.m. ET \n \n Perhaps 5,000 people died in Puerto Rico in 2017 for reasons related to September's Hurricane Maria, according to a study that dismisses the official death toll of 64 as \"a substantial underestimate.\" \n \n A research team led by scientists at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health didn't simply attempt to count dead bodies in the wake of the powerful storm. Instead, they surveyed randomly chosen households and asked the occupants about their experiences. \n \n From that approach, they concluded that between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, there were 4,645 \"excess deaths\" \u2014 that is, deaths that would not have occurred if the island hadn't been plunged into a prolonged disaster following the devastating storm. \n \n But the estimate isn't as precise as the figure implies.The researchers calculate a statistical term called a 95 percent confidence interval, which encompasses a broad range \u2013 from 800 to 8,500 deaths. Their figure of 4,645 lies near the middle of that range, and they round up to something over 5,000 to account for some assumptions they made. \n \n The findings were published Tuesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n The research team randomly selected 3,299 households in Puerto Rico. Local scientists surveyed them over the course of three weeks in January. People in those homes reported a total of 38 deaths. The scientists then extrapolated that finding to the island's total population of 3.4 million people to estimate the number of deaths. The researchers then subtracted deaths recorded during that same period in 2016 and concluded that the mortality rate in Puerto Rico had jumped 62 percent in the three months following the storm. \n \n The death rate is a contentious subject, in part because federal and island governments haven't responded as rapidly to the disaster as they have in other hurricane emergencies. The study notes that 83 percent of the households in Puerto Rico were without electrical power for the time period looked at, more than 100 days, from the date of the hurricane until the end of 2017. \n \n Puerto Rico residents and outside observers have long argued that the official death toll is hopelessly inadequate. It captures the number of deaths the medical examiner attributed directly to the storm \u2014 the high water and howling winds in the worst natural disaster on record for the U.S. territory. Maria came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds gusting at over 110 mph and drenching rainfall. \n \n CNN surveyed funeral homes after the storm and tallied 499 hurricane-related deaths. The New York Times compared official death records from September and October 2017 and identified more than 1,000 excess deaths, compared with the average for 2015 and 2016. Alexis Santos, a researcher at Penn State University, and a colleague, used death certificates to come up with a similar estimate. \n \n The government of Puerto Rico commissioned researchers from George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health to estimate excess deaths. Results of that study have been delayed and are due out this summer. \"We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,\" said Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. He says that's why it commissioned the study from GW. \"Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost.\" \n \n Caroline Buckee, a lead author of the news and epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says, \"Our approach is complementary to that and it provides a different kind of estimate and a different kind of insight into the impact of the hurricane.\" The researchers suggested that the government in Puerto Rico could use its methods in an even larger survey to reduce the large uncertainties in their findings. \n \n The Harvard study covers a greater time period than The New York Times' calculation, a difference that could partly account for the much higher figure. \n \n The household survey is a widely accepted technique for estimating casualties following a disaster. But it can be misleading if the sample isn't truly random or if some households have been wiped out altogether and are therefore missing from the survey. In the latter, the result would underestimate the true toll. In fact, the Harvard team says its results are \"likely to be an underestimate\" because of this bias. \n \n National Communication Issues In Puerto Rico Make It Hard To Register Deaths Communication Issues In Puerto Rico Make It Hard To Register Deaths Listen \u00b7 4:04 4:04 \n \n The survey looked at deaths through the end of 2017, but the scientists suspect that the excess deaths continued into this year. \"We saw consistent, high rates, in September, October, November, December,\" says Rafael Irizarry, a biostatistician on the research team. \"There's no reason to think that on Jan. 1 this trend stops.\" \n \n \"Hurricane Maria caused massive infrastructural damage to Puerto Rico,\" the Harvard team writes in its study. \n \n \"In our survey, interruption of medical care was the primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months following the hurricane,\" the wrote. Hospitals and doctors struggled to provide care, and many people simply had trouble getting to the doctor or the hospital to seek medical care. The survey finds that one-third of the total deaths in the months following the storm were caused by delayed or interrupted health care. \n \n Understanding the true number is important for many reasons. \"There are ramifications not only for families, not only for closure, but also financial ramifications\" such as for aid and preparedness, says Dr. Satchit Balsari, one of the lead investigators, who is a physician at the Harvard FXB Center for Health and Human Rights.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The official government death toll in Puerto Rico from devastating Hurricane Maria stands at 64. A new assessment led by Harvard researchers puts the figure closer to 5,000, reports NPR. More specifically, the researchers calculate that Puerto Rico had 4,645 \"excess deaths\" between Sept. 20, 2017, and Dec. 31, they write in the New England Journal of Medicine. How they got the figure: Researchers surveyed 3,299 homes in January and February and turned up 38 deaths in the time period after the hurricane, then extrapolated the figure to the island's population of 3.4 million. They concluded with a 95% certainty that the death toll attributable to the hurricane is between 800 and 8,500, with the figure of 4,645 a likely estimate. They also found that when comparing the number of deaths to 2016, the island's mortality rate increased 62% in the three months following the storm. \"Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,\" the authors write. The toll of 64 mostly counts people killed directly by rising water or wind, and the Washington Post provides an example of a death that went uncounted. Ivette Leon, 54, died at home in November, less than a day after being released from the hospital. As her condition deteriorated, it took family members 20 minutes to get cell reception to summon help, and then nonworking traffic lights delayed the arrival of an ambulance. The new study suggests there are thousands more like her. \"That is an astonishing undercount,\" a Columbia professor who wasn't involved with the study tells BuzzFeed News. \"Something has gone terribly wrong here if they have a 70-times-higher death rate.\"",

    "document": "A weird one, this. Yesterday, a short walk away from me in Chesterton, Cambridge, an enigmatic threat appeared in three-foot-high letters on a new row of upmarket houses flanking the banks of the Cam. But these weren\u2019t the usual slapdash daubings. No, the letters were lavishly painted across four houses by a ladder-wielding vigilante ten feet above the ground. The stunt has made national headlines, not so much for the content of the protest as for its medium \u2013 Latin. \n \n Well, it is and it isn\u2019t Latin. It proclaims, Locus in domos loci populum! Purists will object that the Romans had to muddle through without the indulgent hyperbole of exclamation marks. True; but anyone with a smattering of Latin will see the bigger problem: however construed, the Latin is nonsense \u2013 \u2018the place into homes, the people of the place\u2019. Even as a ten-pinter, that is not going to wash as a slogan. \n \n For most news outlets, however, it\u2019s enough of a story that University-town dissenters deal in Latin: \u2018only in Cambridge\u2019, they smirk, could protesters rant in the language of Ancient Rome. Some reporters tentatively add that the Latin may be wrong. However, the interesting thing is not how the Latin is wrong but that it is totally wrong: every word misfires. With a little reflection on this genuine curiosity, the culprit\u2019s profile starts to gain colour. \n \n What then? A set of slips from whirring brain or adrenalin-riddled hand beneath the blanket of night? No, its uniform appearance twice on the walls puts paid to that. Or maybe a sign of the debasement of linguistic precision \u2013 even in Latin \u2013 in these Twitter-fuddled times? No, no. Instead, the gibberish springs from a belief in the omniscience of the online \u2018powers that be\u2019. Here speaks the unwavering but unmeaning voice of Google. If you ask its online translator to render \u2018local homes for local people\u2019 into Latin, this is the twaddle that tumbles forth. Yet it shouldn\u2019t be the story that the quasi-oracular Google can\u2019t handle a heavily inflected language. I\u2019ve already said my piece on its unfortunate role in the high-stakes business of self-graffiti. In grassroots revolts, however, this is something new. \n \n There are indeed some real peculiarities here. First, it\u2019s ruddy odd to use Latin as the language of street protest. But to get the Latin so very wrong points to the scantiest of overlaps on the Venn diagram: those who don\u2019t know Latin but do know that Latin will have an effect (witness the flurry!). There are two ways of explaining this queer choice, but they are completely antithetical. On the one hand, it could be an attack on the hazy edifice of \u2018The Establishment\u2019. Latin has been the language of officialdom in Europe for most of the past 2,000 years, and the way to stick two fingers up to homo ille is to abuse him in his own code of Latin. On the other, this could be the city\u2019s stand against the greed of faceless developers and the short-termism of civic planners: how better to attack the abuse of community values \u2013 the development pulled down the Penny Ferry, one of Cambridge\u2019s few riverside pubs \u2013 than to speak in the lingua franca of the University that has been the city\u2019s beating heart for 800 years? Perhaps there\u2019s a thrill in picturing the big beasts of the housebuilding company frantically Google-ing the graffiti as their tears wash over the keyboard? Or perhaps \u2013 were this not too absurd \u2013 the Latin is deliberately debased to reflect the idiocy of corporate management-speak through the lens of historic Cambridge parlance? \n \n I wonder. Other details in the graffiti suggest a rather atypical worldview. A side-door to one of the houses bids the Dollar, Euro and Yen signs to \u2018go away\u2019. Two things strike me here: disappointment, that the vowels of \u2018away\u2019 are represented by that most conformist of signs, the Anarchy symbol; and surprise, that the currency symbol for the Chinese Renminbi was ready at hand. Alongside this posturing with Latin and financial sigla, the name of the estate agents on the sale signs has been replaced with \u2018local lives\u2019: it\u2019s the immediate community that\u2019s being sold short. Thus far we have a defender of the local populace who opposes foreign investment \u2013 and perhaps immigration \u2013 while desiring both Anarchy in the UK and the services of a tax-averse behemoth of Big Data. \n \n So who is behind this? All arrant speculation, of course, but the palaeographer in me says it\u2019s a one-man job (no, this is not a gendered comment), and probably by a woman (ah, that is). I had reached this tentative conclusion before I spotted that the man painted on the adjacent \u2018pedestrian walkway\u2019 (a pavement, I suppose) now luxuriates in some painted accessories: a skirt, kitten heels and a mysterious brace of handheld objects \u2013 perhaps a nosegay of flowers and a Foyles bag, perhaps an industrial-strength padlock and menorah. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no accompanying gloss to shed any light. But the notorious \u2018regendering\u2019 of the pedestrian-crossing icon from male to female in Melbourne last month flashes bright in the background. \n \n A curious picture, then. Australian-inspired identity politics, but aversion to foreign influence? In a city of 74 per cent Remainers, where most of my colleagues cannot grasp what could motivate a Leave voter, could this be the voice of the downtrodden Brexiteer? Perhaps. But I somehow doubt it. At any rate, it\u2019s unfortunate that a serious societal complaint is dogged by both imprecision and innuendo. I won\u2019t be the only one hearing echoes both of Graham Chapman\u2019s Brian from Monty Python, with his miscued Romanes eunt domus, as well as Steve Pemberton\u2019s Tubbs from the League of Gentlemen, who lives through her \u2018Local shop for local people\u2019. We live in confused times. \n \n Locally, at any rate, Latin is not the story. Elsewhere in town we\u2019ve previously had graffiti of Ancient Greek, guanine molecules, quantum physics and pseudo-algebra. Instead, the real issue is Cambridge\u2019s housing stock. For all the gung-ho talk about Osborne\u2019s \u2018Cambridge City Deal\u2019, which promised in 2015 to inject a billion pounds into local infrastructure, this city that has only part pulled itself out of medieval quietude is now under pressure. As Ed West recently wrote, beautiful cities can lift the spirit, and Cambridge is no exception. Alas, many new buildings within the city struggle to hit the mark. Although there are myriad uglier houses than those under attack, no long-term architectural grace is on offer for a million pounds plus. \n \n The average Cambridge house price is around \u00a3500,000, the third highest in the country, and 16 times higher than the average local salary. Few Cambridge workers have jobs to meet that sum, and yet fewer to climb the housing ladder for the first time. Still, a new row of houses clocking in around \u00a31.25 million will sell without problem \u2013 albeit not to the local populace. This is not quite the London model, as only a handful of people are paid enough within Cambridge\u2019s city limits to afford such properties. Instead, the money must come from outside the city, and perhaps, as the graffitist augurs, outside the country. Roughly a third of Cambridge sales are now to overseas buyers; some have genuine business in the city, most do not. In this context, domus loci populo loci may indeed be a valid graffito. \n \n As I say, a weird one. Some 1500 years ago, the Vandals ransacked Rome and razed it to the ground. Yes, \u2018only in Cambridge\u2019 will vandals instead take up the language of Rome as a weapon. But in doing so the point of the protest has been blunted by these strange pretentions of the protestrix. \n \n Dr David Butterfield is the Director of Studies in Classics at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge ||||| Image copyright Richard Taylor Image caption Four houses were vandalised overnight \n \n A development of luxury homes in Cambridge has been daubed with graffiti - written in Latin, of course. \n \n Vandals spray-painted the new five-bedroom river-front houses with the words Locus in Domos Loci Populum. \n \n Locals have said the messages, which appear to be a protest against the development, could \"only happen\" in the university city. \n \n The homes, in Water Street, Chesterton, priced from \u00a31.25m are on the site of an old pub. \n \n Cambridge University Professor of Classics, Mary Beard, said: \"This is a bit hard to translate, but I think what they're trying to say is that a lovely place has been turned into houses.\" \n \n More on this and other news - in English - from Cambridgeshire \n \n The five detached homes, overlooking the River Cam, are being sold jointly by agents Bidwells and Tucker Gardner as a \"true 'reflection' of the space and tranquillity\" of living in this part of the city. \n \n According to Google Translate, the phrase locus in domos means \"room in the house\", and loci populum means \"local people\". \n \n Image caption The homes are being sold for upwards of \u00a31.25m \n \n The graffiti has prompted a flurry of reaction on social media, with many arguing about the meaning. \n \n A number have suggested the vandals typed \"local homes for local people\" into the Google translator, and came up with the phrase \"locus in domos loci populum\". \n \n One wrote: \"Whatever the translation, it's criminal damage.\" \n \n Other comments include: \"This is the most Cambridge thing ever\" and \"it's a different class of graffiti in Cambridge\". \n \n The graffiti is thought to be a protest against the development and the high cost of housing in the city. \n \n According to a recent report from think tank Centre for Cities, Cambridge house prices are the third highest in the country, with the average cost of a city home coming in at \u00a3475,820 meaning many people are priced out of the market. \n \n Image copyright Abbotts Image caption The houses stand on the site of the former Penny Ferry pub \n \n A spokesman for the developer, HC Moss (Builders) Ltd, said the company was \"taking steps to remove the graffiti\" and believed it was an isolated incident.

In a surprising move the culprits decided to use Latin, painting the words \u201cloci populum!\u201d and \u201clocus in domos\u201d in large letters across the front and sides of the houses in Water Street, Chesterton. \n \n Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge University, told the BBC: \u201cThis is a bit hard to translate, but I think what they\u2019re trying to say is that a lovely place has been turned into houses.\u201d \n \n The Latin phrases translate as \u201clocal people!\u201d and \u201cplace of homes\u201d. Other phrases daubed on to the buildings included \u201cWe [heart] our home\u201d and the symbols for dollars, euros and the yen, followed by the phrase \u201cgo away\u201d. \n \n The six houses, built on the site of a pub, have gone on the market at a price of \u00a31.25m each. \n \n Cambridge house prices rise nearly 50% since 2010 Read more \n \n \u201cHouse prices are a massive problem in Cambridge,\u201d said Richard Taylor, a resident who has been campaigning on the development and related issues since it began.

In 2015, someone threatened to \u201cremove or destroy\u201d bicycles chained to railings in the city centre, with the warning written in Greek and Latin. \n \n \u201cWe do have our eccentrics in the city,\u201d Taylor added, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t seem to go together, the ability to write in Latin and being prepared to scrawl on buildings and cause massive amounts of damage.\u201d \n \n A spokesperson for the developer said: \u201cWe have been made aware of the incident of criminal damage at our Water Street development and are taking steps to remove the graffiti. \n \n \u201cThis appears to be an isolated incident and it has been reported to the police who are investigating. We will be reviewing our current security measures at the location.\u201d \n \n Police said they were alerted to reports of criminal damage to four buildings at 8am on Tuesday and officers were investigating. \n \n Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting CF0183620417.",

Police say they are investigating the vandalism, which is believed to be a protest against the development and the high cost of housing in the city. Google Translate suggests the vandals typed \"local homes for local people\" into the translator, and came up with the Latin phrase \" Locus in Domos loci Populum,\" which means \"local people.\" The homes are being sold jointly by agents Bidwells and Tucker Gardner as a \"true 'reflection' of the space and tranquillity of living in this part of the city,\" per the Cambridge News. \u2013 \"This is a bit hard to translate, but I think what they're trying to say is that a lovely place has been turned into houses,\" Cambridge University classics professor Mary Beard tells the BBC.

Other Latin phrases included \"We our home\" and \"go away,\" the Guardian reports. The six new homes, which range in price from $1.5 million to $3 million each, were built on the site of a former pub. \"House prices are a massive problem in Cambridge,\" says Richard Taylor, a Cambridge resident who has campaigned against the development. \"We've got incredibly rich people living one street away from incredibly poor people.

Mr. Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, addressed the performers and musicians at Friday\u2019s final dress rehearsal to tell them about enhanced security measures. The large rally across from Lincoln Center drew some Jewish leaders, and current and former elected officials like former Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, and Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat, and Peter T. King, a Republican. \n \n Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg attended the opera, Met officials said. \n \n Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld, who was the rally\u2019s master of ceremonies, said he did not expect protesters to react inappropriately. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be responsible when the Metropolitan Opera advocates terrorism and incites violence \u2014 you can\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd anything that happens, that has besmirched this Metropolitan Opera, and besmirched Lincoln Center, is to be laid at the foot of Peter Gelb.\u201d \n \n One protester at the rally, Hilary Barr, 55, a pediatric nurse from Westchester County, said she believed the opera made excuses for terrorism. \u201cBy putting this on a stage in the middle of Manhattan, the message is, \u2018Go out, murder someone, be a terrorist and we\u2019ll write a play about you,\u2019 \u201d she said. \n \n Some people held a counterdemonstration. James Saslow, 66, a professor of theater history at Queens College, had a sign: \u201cA work of art about a subject is not a work in favor of that subject.\u201d \n \n The opera, and the Met, were also defended by some artistic figures. \n \n \u201cIt is not only permissible for the Met to do this piece \u2014 it\u2019s required for the Met to do the piece,\u201d Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, said in an interview. \u201cIt is a powerful and important opera.\u201d \n \n The protests were initially led by several smaller Jewish groups and conservative religious organizations. The larger Anti-Defamation League brokered a compromise with the Met, which pleased few on either side, in which plans to show the opera to a wider audience in movie theaters were dropped, but the New York production would otherwise go on. Leaders in the more liberal Reform Judaism movement have condemned the opera, but did not call for its cancellation. ||||| Since its premiere in 1991, The Death of Klinghoffer has been decried as anti-Semitic and as Zionist propaganda. That makes sense\u2014the opera, created by composer John Adams and librettist Alice Goodman, is based on the 1985 hijacking of a cruise ship by the Palestinian Liberation Front and subsequent murder of 69-year-old wheelchair-bound American Jew Leon Klinghoffer. Tonight, New York City's Metropolitan Opera will mount a production that's already mired in controversy. \"The really ironic and sad fact,\" Adams has said, \"is that the content of this opera is more relevant in 2014 than it was even in 1991.\" \n \n October 7, 1985 \u2013Four men from the Palestinian Liberation Front hijack the MS Achille Lauro, an Italian liner, as it departs Egypt for Israel. They round up the passengers and crew and demand that the ship sail to Syria, ordering the release of 50 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. When denied, they kill retired, wheelchair-bound American Jew Leon Klinghoffer, 69, with shots to the chest and head. The ship's barber and waiter are made to throw him overboard. \n \n April 29, 1990 \u2013The three-hour made-for-TV movie Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair premieres, starring Burt Lancaster as Leon Klinghoffer. The previous year, Karl Malden played the same role in another TV movie, The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro. Both films were supervised by Klinghoffer's daughters and made little news. \n \n March 19, 1991 \u2013The Death of Klinghoffer premieres in Brussels. Originally scheduled for January, the Belgian interior minister asked that it be rescheduled until the end of the Gulf War. The opera garnered lots of attention prior to its debut, but ultimately reviews were lukewarm and focused more on problematic staging and diction than any incendiary messages. \"People come expecting machine-gun fire and bodies being thrown overboard,\" said director Peter Sellars, \"and what they get is a bunch of art.\" \n \n September 5, 1991 \u2013The Death of Klinghoffer makes its American premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Klinghoffer's daughters attend and later say \"the juxtaposition of the plight of the Palestinian people with the cold-blooded murder of an innocent, disabled American Jew is both historically naive and appalling.\" (Critics from the New York Times and Newsday have a similar take.) Following protests from Jewish organizations and the Los Angeles Opera and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, two of five companies that co-commissioned the show, decide not to perform the work as scheduled. \n \n November 7, 1992 \u2013Amid picketing by the Jewish Information League, the San Francisco opera runs six performances of Klinghoffer, the second-best-selling production of the season. \n \n April 1996 \u2013PLF leader Muhammed Zaidan accepts responsibility for Klinghoffer's death. The following year, the Palestinian Liberation Organization reaches a financial settlement with the Klinghoffer family. \n \n November 4, 2001 \u2013A month after the September 11 hijackings, the Boston Symphony Orchestra pulls performances of choruses from Klinghoffer. \"It seems inappropriate to perform excerpts from an opera about a terrorist act right now,\" said conductor Robert Spano. One of the members of the BSO chorus had lost her husband on AA Flight 11, which crashed into the northern tower of the World Trade Center. Music professor Richard Taruskin applauds the decision in the New York Times, arguing that defeating terrorism means \"no longer romanticizing terrorists as Robin Hoods.\" \n \n January 18, 2002 \u2013England's BBC Barbican retrospective on the works on John Adams opens with a concert performance of Klinghoffer. In contrast to the Boston decisions, no one considers canceling the piece while planning for the festival. \"If anything,\" Adams said, \"people were more committed.\" \n \n May 13, 2003 \u2013British filmmaker Penny Woolcock's film version of Klinghoffer premieres at Lincoln Center. It's later scheduled to be screened at the Ramallah International Film Festival but was banned because some members of the Palestinian Authority deemed it \"too pro-Israeli.\" \n \n June 17, 2011 \u2013The Opera Theatre of St. Louis mounts the first new U.S. production of Klinghoffer since its 1991 premiere. A month in advance, it hosts an interfaith dialogue among local Jewish, Christian, and Islamic leaders. The response to the opera is overwhelmingly positive. \n \n February 24, 2012 \u2013In a co-production with the Metropolitan Opera, the English National Opera performs a new production of Klinghoffer, under the direction of Tom Morris (Warhorse). After weeks of anticipated protests, only one picketer stands outside the theater. \n \n June 17, 2014 \u2013Under pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, Met general manager Peter Gelb decides to cancel HD and radio simulcasts of Klinghoffer, insisting that \"the opera is not anti-Semitic,\" but that the broadcast \"would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism.\" Composer John Adams says the change \"goes far beyond issues of \"artistic freedom\" and ends in promoting the same kind of intolerance that the opera's detractors claim to be preventing.\" \n \n \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \n \n Also on Details.com: \n \n The Scandalous New Tennessee Williams Biography That's Heavy on Sex, Drugs, and Depravity \n \n Q&A;: Playwright Kenneth Lonergan Brings His Enduring Coming-of-Age Play This Is Our Youth to Broadway \n \n A Sneak Peek at the First Major Biography of John Updike, the Man Who Made Rabbit Run ||||| NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani joined demonstrators outside the Metropolitan Opera on Monday for an emotional protest against a musical work about the death of a Jewish man they say glorifies his Palestinian killers. \n \n People, some in wheelchairs, gather at Lincoln Center as they protest \"Death of Klinghoffer\" Monday, Oct 20, 2014, in New York.

American composer John Adams' opera has been a lightning rod since February,... (Associated Press) \n \n About 400 people stood behind police barricades chanting \"Shame on the Met!\" and carrying signs saying \"The Met glorifies terrorism\" before the company's first performance of \"The Death of Klinghoffer.\" \n \n The opera is based on the 1985 killing of passenger Leon Klinghoffer on the Achille Lauro, an Italian cruise ship hijacked by four members of the Palestinian Liberation Front. The 69-year-old was shot in his wheelchair and pushed overboard. \n \n American composer John Adams' opera has been a lightning rod since February, when it was scheduled for this season. The first large demonstration came on the Met's Sept. 22 season opening night, featuring a Mozart work, when protesters jeered at arriving spectators. \n \n Standing across the street from Lincoln Center, Giuliani said he wanted to warn people that this opera \"is a distorted work.\" \n \n \"If you listen, you will see that the emotional context of the opera truly romanticizes the terrorists,\" he said. \n \n But opera expert Fred Plotkin said Adams depicts the Klinghoffers as his work's moral spine. \n \n \"Does this opera present the killers in a favorable light? No,\" Plotkin said. \"Are the Klinghoffers far and away the most sympathetic characters in the opera, the ones we care about most? I believe so.\" \n \n Monday's performance went on with a few orchestrated disruptions: Boos were shouted from scattered seats, and a voice kept yelling from a balcony, \"The murder of Klinghoffer will never be forgotten!\" The evening ended with a standing ovation that drowned out any heckling. \n \n Earlier in the day, a rabbi led Jewish teens in a prayer vigil. Youths sat at their makeshift prayer spot opposite the Met, discussing Hebrew scriptures. \n \n \"We're here because the Met is glorifying the killing of a Jew, and we must speak out \u2014 we're the next generation,\" 15-year-old Shabbos Kestenbaum said. \n \n Rabbi Avi Weiss said the opera's music \"extols\" the terrorists, beginning with the \"Chorus of Exiled Palestinians,\" while the Klinghoffers come off as shallow, frivolous characters who enter after the lyrics, \"I've got no money left. I gave all my money for the taxi.\" \n \n \"The language is explosive. It's radioactive. It's dangerous,\" the rabbi said. \"It inspires violence.\" \n \n In fact, it is exiled Jews arriving in Palestine who've spent their last savings to reach their new home in the desert. \n \n The Met canceled the international movie theater and radio broadcasts in November amid pressure from Jewish groups, especially the New York-based Anti-Defamation League. Met general manager Peter Gelb, whose father was Jewish, said the decision was made \"as a compromise gesture.\" \n \n The Met issued a statement this week saying \"the fact that 'Klinghoffer' grapples with the complexities of an unconscionable real-life act of violence does not mean it should not be performed. ... 'Klinghoffer' is neither anti-Semitic nor does it glorify terrorism.\" \n \n The Klinghoffers' daughters, Lisa and Ilsa Klinghoffer, released comments through the ADL to be included in the Met program. They say they believe the arts \"can play a critical role in examining and understanding significant world events. 'The Death of Klinghoffer' does no such thing. It presents false moral equivalencies without context, and offers no real insight into the historical reality and the senseless murder of an American Jew.\" \n \n Plotkin noted many \"Klinghoffer\" opponents, including Weiss, have never seen it performed live. Weiss said he has read the libretto. \n \n Advertising for the opera comes with the slogan: \"See it. Then decide.\" \n \n \"The Death of Klinghoffer\" premiered in Brussels in 1991, with little controversy, then in various European cities and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where it was greeted with praise and anger. \n \n Mayor Bill de Blasio, who hasn't seen the opera, said the rights of cultural institutions to put on works of art have to be respected. \n \n \"We don't have to agree with what's in the exhibit, but we agree with the right of the artist and the cultural institution to put that forward to the public,\" he said. \n \n \"The Death of Klinghoffer\" runs through Nov. 15. ||||| Tags: music \n \n The Death of Klinghoffer, John Adams\u2019s 1991 opera about the hijacking of the Achille Lauro by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985, has achieved a rare distinction in contemporary classical music: it\u2019s considered so dangerous by its critics that they\u2019d like to have it banned. For its opponents \u2013 the Klinghoffer family, Daniel Pearl\u2019s father, conservative Jewish organisations, and now the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York governor George Pataki, who took part in a noisy demonstration outside the Met last night \u2013 Klinghoffer is no less a sacrilege than The Satanic Verses was to Khomeini and his followers. They haven\u2019t issued a fatwa, but they have done their best to sabotage the production ever since the Met announced it. \n \n Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, capitulated in the summer to pressure from the Anti-Defamation League (and, according to the New York Times, from \u2018three or four\u2019 major Jewish donors), cancelling a live broadcast to cinemas around the world. The rationale for the decision, made against the backdrop of the Gaza offensive, was that the opera might be exploited by anti-semites. How, they didn\u2019t say. For some reason the opera\u2019s enemies don\u2019t seem concerned that its unflinching portrayal of the murder of an elderly Jew in a wheelchair might be \u2018used\u2019 to foment anti-Muslim sentiment. \n \n The notion that Adams and his librettist, Alice Goodman, are justifying terrorism is absurd. The hijacking is depicted in all its horror, chaos and fear. The scene that raised accusations of anti-semitism, a dinner table conversation among \u2018the Rumors\u2019, an American-Jewish family, was excised from the libretto long ago. The Klinghoffers come off as typical American tourists, and are drawn with wry affection. In a particularly tense scene, Leon Klinghoffer baits his attackers, reciting a litany of attacks by Palestinian commandos. His version of Middle Eastern history could have been lifted from Leon Uris\u2019s Exodus, but in the circumstances it\u2019s a nervy speech: from his wheelchair, he isn\u2019t afraid to confront the men who end up killing him. \n \n Another complaint against Klinghoffer \u2013 one that Giuliani, the self-styled saviour of New York after 9/11, has predictably raised \u2013 is that it \u2018humanises\u2019 the hijackers. But the hijackers were human, and one of the opera\u2019s chief strengths is its refusal to portray them as a collection of monsters. They are certainly not \u2018glorified\u2019 \u2013 another charge that\u2019s been levelled at the opera. One is a brute who relishes the job, gleefully humiliating the passengers. But another takes pains to tell the ship\u2019s captain about his family\u2019s expulsion from Palestine. And then there is Omar, the reluctant hijacker who \u2013 as a British dancer on board describes in a hilarious aria \u2013 socialises with the passengers and always \u2018kept us in ciggies\u2019. Omar is given the task of killing Klinghoffer: part of the drama of the opera turns on his silent, anguished attempt to steel himself for this act. He dances, he writhes, he imagines himself lying in his mother\u2019s arms, a Palestinian piet\u00e0, before finally pulling the trigger. In the words of the journalist Elizabeth Rubin, with whom I saw the dress rehearsal, he\u2019s the Michael Corleone of the opera, who to prove himself in the eyes of tougher men has to transform himself into a \u2018soldier\u2019. \n \n Still, you could make the case that if The Death of Klinghoffer caricatures anyone, it\u2019s Palestinians, not Jews. The \u2018Chorus of Exiled Palestinians\u2019 that opens the opera features a group in Afghan-style clothes, evoking the vanished paradise of pre-1948 Palestine and the Nakba that robbed them of their land and future. Dressed in black and virtually indistinguishable, they\u2019re designated mourners of Palestine, an undifferentiated mass united in suffering and thirsty for revenge. The women are all covered in full abayas, which is unusual among Palestinian women today, and was even more unusual in 1985. The men wear Afghan-style beards that, outside the Gaza Strip, are rare in Palestine. They wave the green flag of Islam, not the Palestinian red green, white and black flag that even Hamas prefers. The effect of the set design is to frame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as an episode in a larger clash of civilisations between Islam and the West. The libretto, too, accentuates the \u2018civilisational\u2019 dimensions of the conflict. With their incantatory talk about Islam and their love of martyrdom, the hijackers sound more like members of Hamas (which emerged only in 1988) than of Abu Abbas\u2019s secular nationalist PLF. \n \n The \u2018Chorus of Exiled Jews\u2019 which follows is a much sweeter, more intimate piece of music. Their suffering has not been poisoned by anger, but is suffused with sorrow and the hope of renewal. The Jews wear different kinds of clothing; one lyric refers to Hassidim protesting against a cinema opening in Israel, a reminder that Jews aren\u2019t a monolith. Perhaps Goodman\u2019s implication is that after 1948 \u2013 when, for those who follow the Zionist narrative, their \u2018exile\u2019 ended \u2013 Jews could be individuals rather than history\u2019s victims; Palestinians, still under occupation or in exile, have no such luxury. Still, the collective depiction of Palestinians in the opera looks like a failure of imagination. \n \n In 2001, Richard Taruskin accused The Death of Klinghoffer of \u2018romantically idealising criminals\u2019: the Palestinian hijackers, he said, are moved by higher ideals than their victims, ideas of collective struggle and sacrifice. It\u2019s a fair description of the libretto, but it also misses the point: it\u2019s precisely those noble ideals that lead the hijackers to murder an unarmed civilian. I suspect that what disturbs the opera\u2019s critics is that Palestinian suffering is expressed with such eloquence and compassion, not only in the libretto but in the score. Taruskin and others have complained that some of the most stirring music occurs in the \u2018Chorus of Exiled Palestinians\u2019. It\u2019s a telling criticism, an example of what Talking Heads called the \u2018fear of music\u2019: the anxiety that musical beauty might act on its listeners in transgressive ways, and lead to forbidden forms of pleasure or sympathy. What appears to trouble Klinghoffer\u2019s enemies most is that, through the force of his music, Adams has put Western listeners in the shoes of Israel\u2019s victims. \n \n Yet there\u2019s also something unsettling about the chorus, something that causes us to stop short of identification. (The character it\u2019s easiest to identify with is the reasonable and ineffectual ship\u2019s captain, who is neither Jewish nor Palestinian.) The beauty of the Palestinian chorus is stark, brooding and threatening; in Klinghoffer, Palestinians appear condemned to inhabit a realm of perpetual struggle, where life is a battlefield and mundane pleasures are but a memory. And because life is a battlefield, the hijackers see themselves as \u2018soldiers\u2019, not terrorists, when they storm the ship \u2013 and when they execute Klinghoffer. The comparative superficiality of the passengers on the Achille Lauro \u2013 which, in the case of the Klinghoffers, has been misconstrued as anti-semitic caricature \u2013 is a mark of their innocence, their freedom and their privilege. Oblivious to the history that connects them to their tormentors, they naturally see the attack by these \u2018meshugganah\u2019 (as Marilyn Klinghoffer calls them) as an inexplicable accident: their reaction makes them more recognisable, and more believable. The contrast is perhaps too neatly drawn, but it captures a clash in perception that is arguably a strong feature of the encounter between kidnapper and captive. \n \n Those who are afraid of The Death of Klinghoffer because Palestinians have been awarded some of its most beautiful music haven\u2019t listened very carefully \u2013 or haven\u2019t stayed in their seats until the end. The heartbreaking aria that closes the opera belongs to Marilyn Klinghoffer, mourning her husband with controlled anguish. The loss that The Death of Klinghoffer invites us to experience most acutely is personal, not political.",

The opera, penned by composer John Adams, focuses on the murder of Leon Klinghoffer, an American Jewish man in a wheelchair killed by the Palestine Liberation Front during the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship.

It was originally scheduled to be performed by the Met and screened at the International Film Festival, but was banned by the Palestinian Authority because it was deemed to be \"too pro-Israeli.\" Gelb says he decided to cancel the broadcast because it \"would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism.\" \u2013 The Metropolitan Opera's premiere of John Adams' \"Death of Klinghoffer\" has been met with protests from those who say the work glorifies the Palestinian terrorists who murdered the Jewish man on the Achille Lauro cruise ship in 1985. About 400 people stood behind police barricades chanting \"Shame on the Met!\" and carrying signs saying \"The Met glorizes terrorism\" before the company's first performance of the work last night in New York, the AP reports.

The 69-year-old American was shot in his wheelchair and pushed overboard by four members of the Palestinian Liberation Front. \"If you listen, you will see that the emotional context of \u2013 The Metropolitan Opera's new production of John Adams' 1991 opera The Death of Klinghoffer has been met with protests from Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, the family of murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, and Rudy Giuliani, who took part in a demonstration outside the Met last night. The opera tells the story of the Palestine Liberation Front hijacking the Achille Lauro cruise ship in 1985, during which the Klinghoffers, an American-Jewish family, are murdered by the Palestinian hijackers. In a column for the Guardian, Peter Bradshaw notes that the opera \"achieves a rare distinction in contemporary classical music: \u2013 John Adams' opera The Death of Klinghoffer, about the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, has been controversial from the get-go. Critics have accused it of being too sympathetic to the hijackers and too pro-Israel to be seen as anti-Semitic. Here's what they're saying: The opera is \"a much sweeter, more intimate piece of music,\" writes Peter Dobrin in the Guardian. \"Their suffering has not been poisoned by anger, but is suffused with sorrow and the hope of renewal. I suspect that what disturbs the opera's critics \u2013 John Adams' opera The Death of Klinghoffer, about the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by Palestinian hijackers, has been criticized for its anti-Semitic content and for its use of the \"Chorus of Exiled Palestinians,\" a Palestinian chorus. But in the New Yorker, Joshuah Bearman writes that those who are afraid of the opera because Palestinians have been awarded some of its most beautiful music haven't listened very carefully. \"The loss that the opera invites us to experience most acutely is personal, not political,\" he writes. \"It captures a clash in perception that is arguably a strong feature",

    "document": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type, occurring mostly in adults 20 to 60. It affects the heart's ventricles and atria, the lower and upper chambers of the heart, respectively. \n \n \n \n Frequently the disease starts in the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber. The heart muscle begins to dilate, meaning it stretches and becomes thinner. Consequently, the inside of the chamber enlarges. The problem often spreads to the right ventricle and then to the atria. \n \n \n \n As the heart chambers dilate, the heart muscle doesn't contract normally and cannot pump blood very well. As the heart becomes weaker heart failure can occur. Common symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling of the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen and veins in the neck. \n \n \n \n Dilated cardiomyopathy also can lead to heart valve problems, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and blood clots in the heart. \n \n \n \n Other Names for Dilated Cardiomyopathy \n \n Alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

He was 53. An initial autopsy failed to determine the cause of death. \n \n Salter said Tuesday that because Michael died of natural causes, no inquest will be held. \n \n At the time of his death, Michael\u2019s manager told CBS News that he died of heart failure. \n \n In 2011, the singer had a life-threatening bout of pneumonia. At the time, he thanked the staff at Vienna General Hospital for keeping him alive in the intensive care unit. \n \n Michael enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\u201d \u2018\u2019Young Guns (Go For It)\u201c and \u201cFreedom.\u201d As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range.

They are doing good. \n \n \u201cHe was very, very close to both of his sisters. The Greek mentality is to look after people. Melanie made lots of steak.

He stumbles: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I keep saying that.\ufffd? \n \n Kenny was the Wham! frontman\u2019s true love and they split in 2009, although George did not reveal their break-up for another two years. \n \n (Image: KNS News) \n \n They remained close friends and would refer to each other as \u201csoulmates\ufffd?, always putting the foundation at the top of their priorities. \n \n When they split, George said: \u201cI love him very much.

It was a tricky thing. But Jolene, by Dolly Parton, was one of George\u2019s \u00adfavourite songs and when I was thinking about what to do it started playing on the radio. \n \n \u201cI thought that was a sign. We had two dogs together and one of them was \u00adbarking a lot, I also thought that was him trying to tell me something. \n \n \u201cAt the end of the day we need to spread the word about the charities.

We were in constant contact. He was in good spirits.\ufffd? \n \n But on Christmas Day George was found dead in bed at home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, by his current \u00adpartner Fadi Fawaz, 43. \n \n Initial toxicology results were \u00adinconclusive and more tests are being carried out to determine the cause of death. \n \n Asked what he thinks happened, Kenny tells us: \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure but I think his body just gave up. All these years, it was just weak.\ufffd? \n \n Reminiscing about their time together, he continues: \u201cWe were together for 15 years and in the gay world that is a long time. \n \n \"People used to say we \u00adargued but we wouldn\u2019t really. It was always just silly things about who had the remote control. \n \n \u201cWhen we split up there was no big argument, it was just how it was. It was a lovely relationship. I miss him.\ufffd? \n \n George\u2019s philanthropy touched hearts around the world. It recently emerged he gifted \u00a399,000 to Kenyan AIDS charity Omwabini after hearing of its funding problems on Deal Or No Deal. \n \n Kenny adds: \u201cHis generosity was \u00adendless, he helped so many people. \n \n \u201cWe will keep on hearing more and more stories about how he helped others. That is how people will remember him. \n \n \u201cHe was the sweetest person.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 What was once deemed \"inconclusive\" has now arrived at a conclusion, though that conclusion may be cold comfort to fans, friends, and family. Early autopsy results on George Michael couldn't peg what caused his Christmas Day death, but on Tuesday, a UK coroner announced the 53-year-old singer had died of natural causes, spurred by a fatty liver and \"dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis\" (a clinical way of saying heart disease), CBS News reports. Michael's partner, Fadi Fawaz, had put up a bunch of tweets insinuating suicide right after his boyfriend's death; Fawaz later said he'd been hacked and took down the posts. A rep for Michael had mentioned heart failure was the cause after the initial autopsy. Per the American Heart Association, dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by an enlarged heart chamber that eventually affects heart contractions and keeps blood from being efficiently pumped out; myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. A fatty liver could have any of a variety of causes, including drinking too much, a bout with hepatitis C, being overweight, or taking certain medication. \"I think his body just gave up,\" Michael's former partner, Kenny Goss, told the Sunday Mirror over the weekend. Goss adds that now the family can move on with making final arrangements, saying, \"We just want closure, we want the funeral to happen.\" Fawaz, meanwhile, posted a few tweets Tuesday in apparent response to the news, noting, \"The Truth is out...\" and \"Now I hope to receive some real LOVE.\"",

(Associated Press) \n \n FILE - In this Oct. 27, 2012 file photo, Christopher Kennedy Lawford appears at the LA Friendly House Luncheon in Beverly Hills, Calif. Patrick Kennedy says Lawford died of a heart attack on Tuesday, Sept. 4, 2018, in Vancouver. He was 63. (Photo by Todd Williamson/Invision for LA friendly House/File) (Associated Press) \n \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 Author and actor Christopher Kennedy Lawford, who was born into political and Hollywood royalty, sank into substance abuse and addiction and rose to become a well-known advocate for sobriety and recovery, has died. \n \n Lawford died of a heart attack Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, his cousin, former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, told The Associated Press. He was 63. \n \n Lawford was in Vancouver living with his girlfriend and working to open a recovery center. He had been doing hot yoga, which he did often, but the strain of it \"must have been too much for him at that point,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was the only son and oldest child of Patricia Kennedy \u2014 sister of John, Robert and Ted Kennedy \u2014 and Peter Lawford \u2014 the English actor and socialite who was a member of Frank Sinatra's \"Rat Pack.\" \n \n \"I was given wealth, power and fame when I drew my first breath,\" Lawford wrote in his 2005 book, \"Symptoms of Withdrawal: A Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption,\" the first of several books he wrote about his substance struggles. \n \n He wrote that his parents got telegrams predicting big things for him from Bing Crosby and Dean Martin and said he once got a lesson in doing \"The Twist\" from Marilyn Monroe. The cover of his books shows him sitting poolside as a child with his uncle and soon-to-be-president John F. Kennedy looming behind him. \n \n He spent his youth frolicking with Hollywood stars on one coast and rubbing shoulders with political stars on the other, living between libertine Los Angeles and the hyper-competitive Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where he was a big-brother figure to John F. Kennedy Jr. \n \n \"You can't get much more fawned over than being a Kennedy male,\" Lawford wrote. \n \n His life with drugs began with LSD while at boarding school at age 14. In the years before he had experienced the assassinations of his two uncles and his parents' divorce in 1966. \n \n With heroin and other opioids as his substances of choice, Lawford leapt into deeper substance abuse in drug-heavy 1970s Hollywood, where his father also abused drugs and alcohol as his career faded. Peter Lawford died in 1984. Patricia Kennedy died in 2006. \n \n In his memoir, Christopher Lawford told tales of mugging women for money, panhandling in Grand Central Station and getting arrested twice for drug possession before getting sober at 30. \n \n \"There are many days when I wish I could take back and use my youth more appropriately,\" Lawford told The Associated Press in 2005. \"But all of that got me here. I can't ask for some of my life to be changed and still extract the understanding and the life that I have today.\" \n \n Patrick Kennedy, the former congressman from Rhode Island whose father is Edward M. Kennedy, said his cousin \"did something very difficult,\" airing family secrets and temporarily hurting his relationships within the Kennedy clan when he wrote his book. \n \n \"He had the courage to know that he had to find himself, and he wasn't going to be able to do it while holding on to the old family narrative,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was \"tormented by the fact\" that for a time he was estranged from his sisters, Patrick Kennedy said. \n \n \"Over the years of recovery, he ended up reconciling with his sisters, happiest I ever saw him,\" Kennedy said. \n \n His life's work became helping others recover \u2014 including his cousin. \n \n \"He was the absolute cornerstone to my sobriety, along with my wife,\" Patrick Kennedy said (the former politician had been addicted to drugs and alcohol). \"He was the one who walked me through all the difficult days of that early period.\" \n \n After his memoir, Lawford authored several more books on addiction and recovery, most recently 2015's \"What Addicts Know.\" \n \n He worked steadily as an actor, with moderate success. He had a small part in 2003's \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\" made appearances on TV shows including \"Frazier\" and \"The O.C.\" and had recurring roles on the soaps \"All My Children\" and \"General Hospital,\" playing a senator in the latter. \n \n He told the AP in 2005 that his famous dual identities both helped and hurt him in Hollywood. \n \n \"The names give you entree, absolutely, but it's a kind of a double-edged sword,\" he said. \"People do pay attention to you, but nobody gets ahead in Hollywood unless they are really lucky or they deserve it.\" \n \n He is survived by his sisters, Sydney, Victoria and Robin, and his children, David, Savannah and Matt. \n \n ___ \n \n Dalton reported from Los Angeles. ||||| JFK's Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n JFK's Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n 10:45 AM PT: Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Lawford was at a yoga studio Tuesday night when he had a medical emergency and later died.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Lauren Moore ordered Castro held on $8 million bond -- $2 million for each of the three women and the child born to Amanda Berry before they were freed Monday evening. \n \n Hours later, the top prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, announced he'd press for more charges -- \"for each and every act of sexual violence ... each day of kidnapping, every felonious assault (and) all his attempted murders.\" \n \n Furthermore, Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said he'd try to persuade a grand jury to indict the 52-year-old Castro for \"aggravated murder\" for the termination of his captives' pregnancies. He cited a state law that a person can be charged with murder -- a conviction that could lead to the death penalty in Ohio -- for killing unborn children. \n \n Photos: Photos: Kidnapped teens rescued Photos: Photos: Kidnapped teens rescued Kidnapped teens found decade later \u2013 Amanda Berry speaks in a video released on YouTube on Monday, July 8, thanking people for support and privacy.

When that happened, she told investigators, Castro \"starved her for at least two weeks, then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried.\" \n \n It is not known how many times, if any, the other two women got pregnant only to miscarry. One of them, Berry, gave birth to a daughter while in captivity. \n \n That's just one of the brutal tales reported so far about the women's captivity, which McGinty described as \"beyond comprehension.\" \n \n \"The child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of the city,\" he told reporters. \"The horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension.\" \n \n Castro's own mother is among those trying to make sense of the horror. \n \n \"I have a sick son who has done something serious,\" she told Univision and Telemundo. \"I'm suffering very much. I ask for forgiveness from those mothers; may those girls forgive me.\" \n \n Source: Writings detail actions, reasons behind them \n \n So what was going through the suspect's mind, when he allegedly lured three women into a car between 2002 and 2004, took them to his home three miles away and held them there -- where they were chained, threatened and repeatedly sexually assaulted? \n \n Neither Castro, his attorneys nor police have spelled out a motive publicly. \n \n The suspect has talked with investigators, confessing to some of the actions of which he's accused, said a law enforcement source closely involved with the investigation. The source did not describe precisely what Castro confessed to when he was interrogated. \n \n Plus, investigators have asked the state crime lab to expedite tests to create a DNA profile of Castro -- something that typically takes 20 days, but should be back Friday -- said Ohio Attorney General's office spokesman Dan Tierney. \n \n They're also poring over evidence, including more than 200 items seized from Castro's Seymour Avenue home. Among them are writings authorities believe were written by the suspect, said two law enforcement sources closely involved in the case. \n \n Those contain \"specific detailing of actions and reasons behind actions\" tied to the women's abduction and their kidnapper's behavior toward them, one of the law enforcement sources said.

Two of Castro's brothers, Pedro and Onil, were initially arrested in the case only to be released Thursday -- after appearing in court on unrelated cases -- when investigators found nothing, including from the victims' interviews, linking them to the abductions. \n \n One of his daughters, Angie Gregg, told CNN that she \"just wanted to die\" upon hearing her father had been implicated. \n \n But looking back, she thinks there were signs of something awry -- such as how her father \"kept his house locked down so tight\" and would sometimes leave mysteriously for an hour or so, then return, with \"no explanation.\" \n \n \"Everything's making sense now,\" Gregg said. \"It's all adding up, and I'm just disgusted.\" \n \n Source: Death threat if newborn died \n \n According to the initial incident report, the women said Castro first chained them in the basement but later let them live upstairs on the second floor. \n \n The women went outside only twice during their ordeal -- and just \"briefly\" at that, Cleveland Public Safety Director Martin Flask said. \n \n Most of the time the three would be in different rooms, though they interacted occasionally and came to \"rely on each other for survival,\" said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. \n \n One thing they could count on was that their alleged captor wouldn't let them out. \n \n Castro would often test his captives by pretending to leave, the law enforcement source said. Then he'd suddenly return; if there were indications any of the women had moved, they'd be disciplined. \n \n While Knight told investigators Castro forced her to miscarry her own unborn children, she said he ordered her to deliver Berry's child, according to a police source familiar with the investigation. \n \n The baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid, the source said. \n \n Panic ensued soon after. The child stopped breathing, and everyone started screaming, the source said, citing accounts by the young women. \n \n Knight said Castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive, the initial police report states. \n \n \"What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old,\" the source said. \n \n 'I don't think she would have lived very much longer' \n \n JUST WATCHED Ohio victims detail life in captivity Replay More Videos ...

She was interviewed on an \"America's Most Wanted\" segment in 2005 talking about how she'd been with DeJesus, hoping to spend the afternoon with her, shortly before her abduction. \n \n Speaking Thursday on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" she said she last spoke with her father late last month, adding the two had never been close. Whatever their relationship, she insisted, \"I had no idea\" what was happening. \n \n \"I'm really disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated,\" Arlene Castro said. \"... I would like to say that I'm absolutely so, so sorry.\" \n \n Fern Gentry said on CNN's \"Starting Point\" Thursday that hearing Berry, her granddaughter, was alive 10 years after her disappearance was the \"most important thing that ever happened in my life.\" \n \n Gentry, who spoke to Berry by phone from her Tennessee home Tuesday, said she's grateful for all involved in the case -- from police to helpful neighbors -- and that her granddaughter can now live her life. \n \n \"If she hadn't got out, I don't think she would have lived very much longer,\" Gentry said.",

Even though the women watched the search efforts and vigils held for them on TV, they eventually \"succumbed [to] their reality,\" says the source. Additionally, Berry's child, Jocelyn, was not told Michelle Knight's or Gina DeJesus' real names, in case she mentioned them when Castro took her out of the house, WKYC reports. When Berry did make her brave escape, she was afraid to break the locked storm door open in case this was another \"test.\" A police report details their rescuers' arrival on the scene: \"As we neared the top of the steps, Officer Espada hollered out, 'Cleveland Police,' at which time ... Knight ran and threw herself into (Officer) Espada's arms,\" says the report. \"We then asked if there was anyone else upstairs with her, when (DeJesus) came out of the bedroom.\" WKYC notes that a public fund has been set up to provide services for the women.

    "document": "The mysterious corner of the Internet known as the Dark Web is designed to defy all attempts to identify its inhabitants. But one group of researchers has attempted to shed new light on what those users are doing under the cover of anonymity. Their findings indicate that an overwhelming majority of their traffic is driven by the Dark Web\u2019s darkest activity: the sexual abuse of children. \n \n At the Chaos Computer Congress in Hamburg, Germany today, University of Portsmouth computer science researcher Gareth Owen will present the results of a six-month probe of the web\u2019s collection of Tor hidden services, which include the stealthy websites that make up the largest chunk of the Dark Web. The study paints an ugly portrait of that Internet underground: drug forums and contraband markets are the largest single category of sites hidden under Tor\u2019s protection, but traffic to them is dwarfed by visits to child abuse sites. More than four out of five Tor hidden services site visits were to online destinations with pedophilia materials, according to Owen\u2019s study. That\u2019s over five times as many as any of the other categories of content that he and his researchers found in their Dark Web survey, such as gambling, bitcoin-related sites or anonymous whistle-blowing. \n \n The researchers\u2019 disturbing statistics could raise doubts among even the staunchest defenders of the Dark Web as a haven for privacy. \u201cBefore we did this study, it was certainly my view that the dark net is a good thing,\u201d says Owen. \u201cBut it\u2019s hampering the rights of children and creating a place where pedophiles can act with impunity.\u201d \n \n >\u201cBefore we did this study, it was certainly my view that the dark net is a good thing.\u201d \n \n Precisely measuring anything on the Dark Web isn't easy, and the study's findings leave some room for dispute. The creators of Tor known as the Tor Project responded to a request for comment from WIRED with a list of alternative factors that could have skewed its results. Law enforcement and anti-abuse groups patrol pedophilia Dark Web sites to measure and track them, for instance, which can count as a \"visit.\" In some cases, hackers may have launched denial of service attacks against the sites with the aim of taking them offline with a flood of fraudulent visits. Unstable sites that frequently go offline might generate more visit counts. And sites visited through the tool Tor2Web, which is designed to make Tor hidden services more accessible to non-anonymous users, would be underrepresented. All those factors might artificially inflate the number of visits to child abuse sites measured by the University of Portsmouth researchers.1 \n \n \"We do not know the cause of the high hit count [to child abuse sites] and cannot say with any certainty that it corresponds with humans,\" Owen admitted in a response to the Tor Project shared with WIRED, adding that \"caution is advised\" when drawing conclusions about the study's results. \n \n Tor executive director Roger Dingledine followed up in a statement to WIRED pointing out that Tor hidden services represent only 2 percent of total traffic over Tor's anonymizing network. He defended Tor hidden services' privacy features. \"There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously,\" he wrote, referring to Facebook's launch of its own hidden service in October. \"These uses for hidden services are new and have great potential.\" \n \n Here's how the Portsmouth University study worked: From March until September of this year, the research group ran 40 \u201crelay\u201d computers in the Tor network, the collection of thousands of volunteer machines that bounce users\u2019 encrypted traffic through hops around the world to obscure its origin and destination. These relays allowed them to assemble an unprecedented collection of data about the total number of Tor hidden services online\u2014about 45,000 at any given time\u2014and how much traffic flowed to them. They then used a custom web-crawling program to visit each of the sites they'd found and classify them by content. \n \n The researchers found that a majority of Tor hidden service traffic\u2014the traffic to the 40 most visited sites, in fact\u2014were actually communications from \u201cbotnet\u201d computers infected with malware seeking instructions from a hacker-controlled server running Tor. Most of those malware control servers were offline, remnants of defunct malware schemes like the Skynet botnet whose alleged operator was arrested last year. \n \n But take out that automated malware traffic, and 83 percent of the remaining visits to Tor hidden service websites sought sites that Owen\u2019s team classified as related to child abuse. Most of the sites were so explicit as to include the prefix \u201cpedo\u201d in their name. (Owen asked that WIRED not name the sites for fear of driving more visitors to them.) The researchers\u2019 automated web crawler downloaded only text, not pictures, to avoid any illegal possession of child pornographic images or video. \u201cIt came as a huge shock to us,\u201d Owen says of his findings. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone imagined it was on this scale.\u201d \n \n Despite their popularity on the Tor network, child abuse sites represent only about 2 percent of Tor hidden service websites\u2014just a small number of pedophilia sites account for the majority of Dark Web http traffic, according to the study. Drug-related sites and markets like the now-defunct Silk Road 2, Agora or Evolution represented a total of about 24 percent of the sites measured in the study, by contrast. But visits to those sites accounted for only about 5 percent of site requests on the Tor network, by the researchers\u2019 count. Whistleblower sites like SecureDrop and Globaleaks, which allow anonymous users to upload sensitive documents to news organizations, accounted for 5 percent of Tor hidden service sites, but less than a tenth of a percent of site visits. \n \n The study also found that the vast majority of Tor hidden services persist online for only a matter of days or weeks. Less than one in six of the hidden services that was online when Owen's study began remained online at the end of it. Since the study only attempted to classify sites by content at the end of its six month probe, Tor director Roger Dingledine points out that it could over-represent child abuse sites that remained online longer than other types of sites. \"[The study] could either show a lot of people visiting abuse-related hidden services, or it could simply show that abuse-related hidden services are more long-lived than others,\" he writes. \"We can't tell from the data.\" \n \n The Study Raises the Question: How Dark Is The Dark Web? \n \n Other defenders of the Tor network\u2019s importance as an alternative to the public, privacy-threatened Web will no doubt bristle at Owen\u2019s findings. But even aside from the Tor Project's arguments about why the study's findings may be skewed, its results don\u2019t necessarily suggest that Tor is overwhelmingly used for child abuse. What they may instead show is that Tor users who seek child abuse materials use Tor much more often and visit sites much more frequently than those seeking to buy drugs or leak sensitive documents to a journalist. \n \n Nonetheless, the study raises new questions about the darkest subcultures of the Dark Web and law enforcement\u2019s response to them. In November, the FBI and Europol staged a massive bust of Tor hidden services that included dozens of drug and money laundering sites, including three of the six most popular anonymous online drug markets. The takedowns occurred after Owen\u2019s study concluded, so he doesn\u2019t know which of the pedophilia sites he measured may have been caught in that dragnet. None of the site takedowns trumpeted in the FBI and Europol press releases mentioned pedophilia sites, nor did an analysis of the seizures by security researcher Nik Cubrilovic later that month. \n \n >\u201cIt came as a huge shock to us. I don\u2019t think anyone imagined it was on this scale.\u201d \n \n In his Chaos Computer Congress talk, Owen also plans to present methods that could be used to block access to certain Tor hidden services. A certain number of carefully configured Tor relays, he says, could be used to alter the \"distributed hash table\" that acts as a directory for Tor hidden services. That method could block access to a child abuse hidden service, for instance, though Owen says it would require 18 new relays to be added to the Tor network to block any single site. And he was careful to note that he's merely introducing the possibility of that controversial blocking measure, not actually suggesting it. One of Tor's central purposes, after all, is to evade censorship, not enable it. \n \n The study could nonetheless lead to difficult questions for the Tor support community. And it could also dramatically shift the larger public conversation around the Dark Web. Law enforcement officials and politicians including New York Senator Chuck Schumer have railed against the use of Tor to enable online drug sales on a mass scale, with little mention of child abuse. Owen's study is a reminder that criminal content is hiding in the shadows of the Internet that make drug sales look harmless by comparison\u2014and whose consumers may be more active than anyone imagined. \n \n 1Updated 12/30/2014 5:25 EST to add more of the Tor Project's explanations of possible inaccuracies in the study's count of visits to child abuse sites. ||||| Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The study sought to find out which hidden Tor sites got the most traffic \n \n Most traffic to sites hidden on the Tor network go to those dealing in images of child sexual abuse a study suggests. \n \n The six-month study sought to catalogue hidden services on the so-called \"dark net\" and work out which were the most popular. \n \n It found lots of sites peddling illegal drugs but the most popular were those involved with abuse. \n \n However, the researcher behind the study said it was hard to conclude that people were behind all the visits. \n \n Drug traffic \n \n Tor, or The Onion Router, is an anonymising system that lets people use the web without revealing who they are or which country they are in. The anonymity offered by the network has encouraged many people to set up hidden .onion sites that offer content, services and goods that it is illegal to sell openly. \n \n Carried out by Dr Gareth Owen from the University of Portsmouth, the study set up servers to join the Tor network and catalogued hidden services found on it. The system was also able to visit the sites to download HTML content so they could be categorised and to track how many visits each one received. \n \n Traffic to hidden services on Tor represents about 1.5% of all the data passing across the network on any given day. \n \n Over the six months of the study, Dr Owen and his colleagues saw about 80,000 hidden sites on Tor. \n \n \"Most of the hidden services we only saw once. They do not tend to exist for a very long time,\" he said during a speech at the 31st Chaos Communications Congress in Hanover, where he presented his findings. \n \n The top 40 hidden services were involved with controlling botnets - networks of home computers compromised by malicious programs. Many of these botnets have been shut down which has left their client computers fruitlessly polling Tor seeking the now dormant command systems. \n \n The study found that the biggest number of hidden services were dedicated to selling illegal drugs. Also in the top five were underground markets, fraud sites, mail services and those dealing in the virtual currency Bitcoin. \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption Hidden sites peddling illegal drugs are also popular on Tor \n \n Although the number of sites dealing in images of abuse on Tor is small, traffic to them dwarfs that going to other sites, said Dr Owen. \n \n About 75% of the traffic observed in the study ended up at abuse sites, said Dr Owen. \n \n \"When we found this out we were stunned,\" he said. \"This is not what we expected at all.\" \n \n Despite the findings, Dr Owen cautioned against drawing too many conclusions since he did not know which visits were done by people and which by machines. \n \n \"It's not as quite as straightforward as it looks,\" he said. \"It might look like there are lots of people visiting these sites but it is difficult to conclude that from this information.\" \n \n \"What proportion are people and which are something else? We simply don't know.\" he said, adding that \"crawlers\" run by law enforcement and other agencies that police abuse sites could be responsible for the steady stream of traffic. \n \n Roger Dingledine, one of the original developers of Tor, also said the methodology of the study - which only scanned long-lived sites to see what content they offered - made it hard to draw conclusions about what people did on the network. \n \n \"Without knowing how many sites disappeared before he got around to looking at them, it's impossible to know what percentage of fetches went to abuse sites,\" he said. \n \n \"There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously,\" he added. \n \n \"These uses for hidden services are new and have great potential.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Between March and September of last year, four out of five visits to a major part of the Dark Web\u2014the anonymous corner of the Internet\u2014were to sites exhibiting the sexual abuse of children, says a new study picked up by Wired. These sites account for only 2% of the Dark Web, but got five times more traffic (or about 83%) than other sites, like those selling drugs, offering gambling, or providing a haven for whistleblowers. \"Before we did this study, it was certainly my view that the dark net is a good thing. But it\u2019s \u2026 creating a place where pedophiles can act with impunity,\" says UK computer science researcher Gareth Owen. The websites studied are part of Tor hidden services\u2014which allows users to surf the web anonymously, BBC explains\u2014and they occupy the biggest chunk of the Dark Web. Owen used relay computers and a web-crawling program to collect his data. Tor executives point out the results could be distorted, and Owen acknowledges that \"caution is advised\" when assessing them. \"We do not know the cause of the high hit count (to child abuse sites) and cannot say with any certainty that it corresponds with humans,\" he says. It's possible the traffic could be caused by law enforcement groups conducting investigations or hackers flooding the sites with fake visits. And then there's the positive justification for an anonymous web. \"There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously,\" says Tor's executive director. Still, law enforcement and politicians are expected to push for a crackdown because of the study, and Owen says there may be ways to block child abuse sites.

    "concatenated_intermediate": "\u2013 A six-month study of the \"Dark Web\" has revealed a disturbing truth: Most of the traffic to sites protected by the Tor anonymity system goes to child porn sites, Wired reports. \"Before we did this study, it was certainly my view that the dark net is a good thing,\" computer science researcher Gareth Owen says. \"But it's hampering the rights of children and creating a place where pedophiles can act with impunity.\" Owen and his team found that more than four out of five Tor hidden services visited sites with pedophilia materials. That's more than five times as many as any of the other categories of content they found in their Dark Web survey, such as gambling, bitcoin-related sites, or anonymous whistle-blowing. Click for more. \u2013 The so-called \"dark web\" is a place where pedophiles lurk with impunity, according to a new study out of the UK's University of Portsmouth. Researchers found that 83% of the sites they tracked on the Tor network were related to child abuse, they report in the journal Child Exploitation andExploitation Research. That's a big deal, the study's lead researcher tells Wired, because it's the first time such a high percentage has been found on the dark web. \"It's hampering the rights of children,\" says the lead researcher. \"The more pedophilia sites out there, the more likely they are to be used for the abuse of children.\" The researchers ran 40 \"relay\" computers in the Tor Network for eight months, gathering data about the number of hidden services and how much traffic passed through them. They then visited each of the 40 sites they identified by content. The researchers found that most of the traffic to the 40 most visited sites came from \"botnet\" computers infected with malware seeking instructions from a hacker-controlled server running Tor. Most of those malware control servers were offline, remnants of defunct malware schemes like the Skynet botnet whose alleged operator was arrested last year. But take out \u2013 A six-month study of the Tor anonymity network has found that it's used more for child pornography than for censorship, Wired reports. \"It came as a huge shock to us,\" says study co-author Mark Owen. \"I don't think anyone imagined it was on this scale.\" The study found that 83% of all visits to Tor hidden services went to sites classified as related to child abuse. Most were so explicit that they included the prefix \"pedo\" in their name. Owen's team found that child abuse sites made up just 2% of all hidden services, but they accounted for more than half of all Tor visits to pedophilia sites. Drug-related sites, including Silk Road 2, Agora, and Evolution made up about 24% of the sites studied, but only 5% of Tor visits went to those sites. Whistleblower sites, like SecureDrop and Globaleaks, made up less than a tenth of 1% of site visits. Less than one in six of the hidden services remained online at the end of the study. Owen plans to present methods that could be used to block access to certain hidden services in his talk at Computer Congress next month. \u2013 A new study has found that child pornography is big business on the so-called \"dark web,\" the BBC reports. \"When we found this out we were stunned,\" says Dr. Gareth Owen, the lead researcher on a six-month study of 80,000 hidden sites on the Tor network. \"This is not what we expected at all.\" Owen and his team found that 75% of the traffic to sites they catalogued ended up at porn sites. They say they were \"stunned\" by the figure, which dwarfs the number of sites selling illegal drugs. The study also found that 40% of the top 40 hidden services were linked to botnets that control home computers. Owen says he doesn't know who is behind all the visits to the sites. \"It might look like there are lots of people visiting these sites but it is difficult to conclude that from this information,\" he says. \"What proportion are people and which are something else? We simply don\u2019t know.\" One of the original developers of Tor says the methodology of the study makes it difficult to determine who is responsible for the traffic. \"Without knowing how many sites disappeared before he got around to looking at them, it\u2019s impossible to know what percentage fetches went to",

New from Trojan, a brand you trust. Introducing vibrating Tri-Phoria \u2014 it\u2019s like three massagers in one.\u201d \n \n The new commercial, by Sullivan Productions of Tampa, Fla., calls the product a \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d Borrowing a trope from pharmaceutical commercials, it continues, \u201cSide effects of Tri-Phoria may include screams of ecstasy, curled toes, a sudden glow and intense waves of pleasure.\u201d \n \n In \u201cThe Technology of Orgasm,\u201d a history of the vibrator, Rachel P. Maines writes that in the early 1900s the devices were advertised in women\u2019s magazines and the Sears catalog, albeit obliquely as relaxation aids, and it was not until they started appearing in stag films in the 1920s that, as Ms. Maines puts it, their \u201csocial camouflage\u201d was undone and such ads disappeared. \n \n Asked to review the new Tri-Phoria commercial, Ms. Maines said it \u201ccomes very close to telling you what it is good for\u201d without quite doing so. \n \n \u201cThe camouflage used to be a lot thicker, but there\u2019s still a very thin layer of camouflage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe networks have moved to where they\u2019re resigned to accept some sort of advertising \u2014 but they still require a fig leaf held up with suspenders.\u201d \n \n Brian Fays, executive vice president for advertising at MTV, which is owned by Viacom, lauded Trojan\u2019s restraint. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cNo matter how liberal you are, a little kid doesn\u2019t need to hear the word \u2018vibrator,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Fays, who knows about advertising decisions by other Viacom networks that accepted the Tri-Phoria commercial, like Comedy Central, Logo and Spike. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cAt first there was a certain amount of trepidation that maybe the viewing public wasn\u2019t prepared to see a commercial with vibrators, and we automatically put it in the overnight slot, but we opened it up because, instead of it being taboo, they got their point across subtly,\u201d he said. \n \n MTV, in fact, is among the most restrictive of the cable networks, permitting the Tri-Phoria spot only between 3:30 a.m. and 6 a.m., which Mr. Fays attributed to the network\u2019s having a \u201cyounger demographic.\u201d But if the commercial has \u201csmooth sailing\u201d during earlier slots on other Viacom networks, MTV may permit it to be seen in earlier time slots too, he said. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement urging, among other things, that ads for erectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra be shown only after 10 p.m. and \u201cnot be overly suggestive.\u201d \n \n Trojan says the Tri-Phoria campaign represents the largest advertising campaign for a vibrator, and that the company is spending \u201cmillions\u201d on it, but declines to be more specific. The Trojan brand spent a total of $22.4 million on advertising (most of it focused on condoms) in 2009, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. \n \n Market research companies that follow a variety of consumer goods do not track the vibrator market, but research by Trojan pegs annual revenue for the devices in the United States at about $1 billion, 2.5 times that of condoms. \n \n According to Trojan-financed studies published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, 52.5 percent of women and 44.8 percent of men have used vibrators. Contrary to the perception that the devices are nearly always used by the unaccompanied, 40.9 percent of women and 40.5 percent of men report having used them with sexual partners. \n \n Men made 40 percent of the online purchases of the Mini and the Touch, two small vibrators Trojan introduced in the last two years. In 2009 it focused on men with ads in Maxim for the Mini. \n \n Jim Daniels, vice president for marketing at Trojan, said the restrained approach of the ad on cable networks would increase the likelihood of eventually gaining approval for the commercials on the major broadcast networks. \n \n \u201cOur goal is with facts and experience on our side to approach networks for approval, possibly in the early part of next year,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \n \n He says that although Tri-Phoria is available only on Trojan\u2019s Web site now, he expects it to be carried at major retailers like CVS, Walgreen\u2019s and Wal-Mart beginning in the first half of 2011. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cThis is right in Trojan\u2019s wheelhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we\u2019re creating a good buzz \u2014 pun intended \u2014 and we think consumers will be happy with the products we\u2019re offering.\u201d ||||| Trojan recently released a state-of-the-art vibrator: the Triphoria. Three unique tips! The company also figured out how to get cable networks to let them advertise the sex toy during the day: Don't call it a \"vibrator.\" \n \n Trojan just assumed that prudish cable networks would stick their commercial for Triphoria between early-morning reruns of Seinfeld. But the spot does such a good job of just barely indicating what the product does that many networks, including VH1 and Comedy Central, have approved the commercial for early evening and even day slots, according to the Times. \n \n The key was not mentioning the word \"vibrator.\" One network exec tells the Times: \"No matter how liberal you are, a little kid doesn't need to hear the word \u2018vibrator,'\" Instead, the commercial plugs the \"vibrating triphoria,\" as a \"personal massager.\" \n \n So, kids will turn into sex maniacs at the word \"vibrator,\" but \"vibrating Triphoria\" is OK? We know kids are dumb, but do they not understand how nouns and verbs work? Can they not comprehend the fact that something which vibrates is, technically, a \"vibrator\"? We are headed down a slippery semantic slope, here. By this logic, Trojan could advertise a new double-headed dildo\u2014the Duojoy\u2014by marketing it as the \"dual-penetrating Duojoy.\" Or a new ball-gag\u2014the Stuff-o-Matic: The \"Smothering Stuff-o-matic\".

    "document": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea is believed to be moving an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a South Korean lawmaker said after being briefed by the country's intelligence service. \n \n The lawmaker told CNN Tuesday it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was and how it was being transported. He attended the briefing by South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) in Seoul on Monday. \n \n All eyes have been on North Korea following the country's sixth test of a nuclear weapon Sunday. Seismological data indicated the weapon was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. \n \n North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. \n \n Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. \n \n The country has test-fired a number of missiles this summer, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range one in August that overflew the Japanese island of Hokkaido. \n \n Lawmaker Kim Byung-kee told reporters Monday after the same briefing that the NIS said North Korea may test-fire an ICBM towards the North Pacific at a lower angle than the two tests in July, which were lofted, meaning they flew higher but not as far. \n \n Live-fire drills \n \n The South Korean Navy announced Tuesday it conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula to check its \"immediate operational readiness\" after the country's Air Force and Army conducted their own joint drills. \n \n South Korea's Navy conducted a live-fire drill in the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's Sunday nuclear test. \n \n \"Wherever it is, whether on or under water, if North Korea provokes, we will immediately destroy and bury them at sea,\" the Navy said in a statement. \n \n While South Korean forces have flexed their muscles, diplomats in New York gathered at the United Nations and condemned the nuclear test. \n \n Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday the United States would circulate a resolution in response after urging her colleagues to adopt the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. \n \n \"Enough is enough,\" Haley said. \"North Korea has basically slapped everyone in the face in the international community that has asked them to stop.\" \n \n Another lawmaker who attended the Monday briefing, Lee Cheol-woo, told reporters the NIS informed them that Pyongyang had dug extra tunnels at the nuclear test site and could explode another one \"anytime.\" \n \n Rift? \n \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, spoke by phone Monday and agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles, according to a South Korean presidential spokesman. \n \n But signs of a rift between the two leaders have become apparent despite the decades-long alliance between Seoul and Washington. \n \n Their phone call came a day after the nuclear test and followed a tweet from Trump in which he criticized South Korea for \"appeasement\" when it comes to dealing with its northern neighbor. \n \n Moon has long been a proponent of more dialogue and diplomacy with North Korea, whereas Trump has said recently that \"talking is not the answer.\" \n \n \"This is not the time for these two countries to be showing these cracks. North Korea is going to exploit that,\" said Jean Lee, a North Korea expert and global fellow at the Wilson Center. \n \n Trump spoke twice with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend, once before the nuclear test and once after. \n \n Diplomacy \n \n Moon and Abe are both traveling to the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok for an economic summit taking place Wednesday and Thursday. \n \n They will be joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is currently in China for a summit of the BRICS nations -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. He reiterated calls for North Korea to stop nuclear tests but said dialogue needs to be the answer. \n \n JUST WATCHED China's leader urges for global peace Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China's leader urges for global peace 02:15 \n \n \"Russia condemns these exercises from North Korea. We think these exercises are provoking in nature but we should not forget and North Koreans should not forget what happened in Iraq,\" he said. \n \n \"Sanctions of any kind are usefulness and ineffective ... they will eat grass but they will not turn away from the path that will provide for their security,\" Putin said, referring to accusations that Pyongyang spends too much on weapons programs while its citizens starve. ||||| An ICBM test by North Korea on Sept. 9? 9:04 PM ET Sun, 3 Sept 2017 | 02:51 \n \n North Korea could launch yet another missile as soon as Saturday when the country celebrates its founding day, hot on the heels of its biggest-to-date nuclear test. \n \n \"I think another ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] test ... could come on Sept. 9. The North Koreans love to put on a big show for their big national holiday,\" said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the U.S.-based Center for the National Interest. \n \n In fact, one of the pariah state's previous nuclear trials fell on Sept. 9, 2016. \n \n For North Korea, the timing of weapons tests is of strategic importance. \n \n \"They're going to want to get the most attention they can,\" Kazianis told CNBC in August. That means Pyongyang is unlikely to provoke at a time when it expects another major event to be dominating the headlines, he suggested.",

Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around Saturday: Sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. CNBC notes North Korea conducted a nuke test on Sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin on Tuesday gave his take on the situation: North Korea \"will eat grass but will not give up the (nuclear) program if they don't feel safe.\"",

    "document": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kim Jong-un stressed the need to \"remove confrontation\" between the two Koreas \n \n The North Korean leader has delivered a new year's message on state TV, the first such broadcast for 19 years. \n \n Kim Jong-un, in power since 2011, spoke of the need to improve the economy and also to reunify the Koreas, warning that confrontation only led to war. \n \n The speech came less than a month after the conservative Park Geun-hye was elected president of South Korea. \n \n In 1994, Mr Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung, spoke on radio and TV. His son, Kim Jong-il rarely spoke in public. \n \n In addition to Mr Kim's televised address, new year's messages were issued in the form of a joint editorial by North Korea's three main newspapers. \n \n Musical performance \n \n Kim Jong-un said 2013 would be a year of creations and changes, calling for a \"radical turnabout\" that would transform the impoverished, isolated state into an \"economic giant\" and raise living standards. \n \n Analysis After a year of rocket launches and international isolation, the new year speech seemed to refocus North Korea's sights on the economy. There were the usual tributes to military strength, but less open hostility than in some previous speeches. Instead the focus was a call by the North Korean leader for the country to become \"an economic giant\". It was, he said, the \"most important task\u2026 in the present stage of building a thriving socialist economy\". Pyongyang has become increasingly isolated internationally over the past few years, and has become heavily reliant on China for its economic survival. With a new president due to take office in South Korea next month, some analysts saw signs of conciliation. President-elect Park Geun-hye has said she wants to rebuild trust, and - eventually - economic and diplomatic contacts with the North. In the new year speech, her counterpart in Pyongyang called for an end to confrontation between the North and the South, and for both sides to \"respect... and implement\" previously-agreed declarations. Many in the South - and in Washington - will want to see concrete evidence of Pyongyang's willingness to do that. \n \n But while he said confrontation between the North and the South should be removed, Mr Kim stressed that military power remained a national priority. \n \n \"The military might of a country represents its national strength. Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country,\" he said. \n \n The message coincides with UN Security Council discussions on how to punish Pyongyang for a recent long-range rocket launch. \n \n Under Mr Kim's leadership, North Korea has conducted two long-range rocket launches - actions condemned by the US and Pyongyang's neighbours as banned tests of missile technology. \n \n The launch in April failed, but December's attempt appears to have been a success, placing a satellite into orbit. \n \n The US, Japan and South Korea are seeking a response in the UN Security Council, which banned North Korea from missile tests after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. \n \n Kim Jong-un saw in the new year by watching a musical performance with his wife, North Korean state media reported. ||||| In this Friday, Dec. 21, 2012 image made from video, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks at a banquet for rocket scientists in Pyongyang, North Korea. (AP) \n \n In a domestically televised New Year\u2019s Day speech, North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Eun said he wants to \u201cremove confrontation\u201d on this divided peninsula and called on \u201canti- \n \n reunification forces\u201d in South Korea to end their hostility toward the North. \n \n The lengthy address, which laid out North Korea\u2019s goals for the year, marked Kim\u2019s first formal remarks since the election two weeks ago of Park Geun-hye as South Korea\u2019s next president. \n \n The North Korean leader asked for a detente \u2014 but with prerequisites that the conservative Park is likely to be reluctant to accept. Both sides, Kim said, must implement joint agreements signed years ago by the North and liberal, pro-engagement presidents in Seoul. Those agreements call for, among other things, economic cooperation, high-level government dialogue and the creation of a special \u201ccooperation\u201d zone in the Yellow Sea, where the North and South spar over a maritime border. \n \n Park, who takes office next month, has said that she will resume humanitarian exchanges and small-scale economic projects with the North \u2014 efforts that were shuttered under outgoing hard- \n \n liner Lee Myung-bak. But Park has pledged to hold off on major economic cooperation unless the North disassembles its nuclear weapons program, something Pyongyang says it will never do. \n \n With his speech Tuesday, Kim reinforced his image as a far more outgoing leader than his father, Kim Jong Il, who ruled for 17 years and addressed North Korean citizens only once, with a \u00adseconds-long exhortation at a military parade. During Kim Jong Il\u2019s tenure, the New Year\u2019s message was delivered in a lengthy editorial carried by the state-run newspapers. \n \n 1 of 35 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Images from around the world View Photos Take a look at some of the week\u2019s best photographs from around the globe.

On Tuesday, Kim emphasized many staple themes of the country\u2019s daily propaganda: He spoke about economic improvement but did not mention the North\u2019s destitution and food shortages. He called for a \u201cdynamic struggle to boost production\u201d but gave no clear sign that the government would change its spending priorities \u2014 its military and weapons programs. \n \n Kim also portrayed a successful satellite launch last month as an event that would inspire North Korea\u2019s citizens to work harder to boost the economy. Washington and its allies say the launch was a de facto test of an intercontinental ballistic missile and defied U.N. Security Council resolutions. \n \n \u201cLet us bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant with the same spirit and mettle as were displayed in conquering space,\u201d Kim said, enunciating what he said was the Workers\u2019 Party slogan for 2013. \n \n His speech had no mention of the United States or the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.",

So, while the national average retail price is down to $3.72, that's still a record for gas prices this time of year. \n \n Labor Day: Where does it come from? \n \n A gasoline pump shows a customer has spent $40.00 for just eight gallons of gasoline at a Shell station in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles in this October 2012 file photo. Relief has finally come in the form of gas prices' seasonal slide. \n \n Motorists can relax a little, because the seasonal slide in gas prices has finally begun. \n \n After 11 straight days of decline, the national average retail price of gasoline dipped to $3.72 Friday, down from a summer peak of $3.87. \n \n But this year's decline has been delayed. Thus, Americans are still paying record-high prices for this time of year \u2013 and will continue to pay them for some time. \n \n After jumping 9 percent in August, gas prices rose 7 percent in September, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The cost of gas has increased for three straight months. The reason? \n \n The summer has been rife with refinery and pipeline complications. Supplies ran thin at the height of road trip season, raising prices and adding to the financial distress felt by many Americans. \n \n For Californians, the summer went out with a bang. Drivers endured record hikes in early October as California eeked past Hawaii as the most expensive state for gasoline. \n \n Prices there have since stabilized, but California lags behind the rest of the country in starting the seasonal slide. The average price of gas was $4.51 in California Friday, 79 cents higher than the national average, according to GasBuddy.com, a group of local websites that track gasoline prices. \n \n \"If you're along the West Coast, specifically California, you have my sympathy,\" wrote Patrick DeHaan of GasBuddy.com on Tuesday. \"Prices just aren't coming down fast enough \u2013 but at least they're coming down and not going up.\" \n \n Every fall, prices drop as oil producers switch to cheaper winter-blended gasoline and the closing of driving season drives down demand. \n \n Despite the decline, gas is still 27 cents more expensive than it was one year ago. The daily average price had been the highest on record for that particular calendar day for eight straight weeks, according to a report Monday by AAA, a federation of motor clubs that is based in Heathrow, Fla. AAA predicts a further slide in gas prices, coupled with continued daily records through the end of the year. \n \n Still, as Mr. DeHaan points out, there's good news ahead: \n \n \"[F]or the abundance of Americans who consume gasoline in their primary vehicles, the time has finally come: The drop in gasoline prices is coming.\" ||||| Early fall run-up in gasoline prices is fading fast. With inventories rising and demand slowing, wholesale gas prices are plunging. Consumers should see some major price cuts at the pump within weeks. \n \n Teresa Jones watches the pump at a Shell station in Los Angeles in August. (Photo: Grant Hindsley, AP) Story Highlights Rising inventories, lower demand could push prices down 50 cents \n \n Midwest, other regions could see pump prices in $3 range \n \n Economy, Obama could get a lift from plunging gas prices \n \n Autumn gasoline prices are about to drop faster than fall foliage. \n \n As inventories rises and demand wanes, gasoline prices could plunge up to 50 cents a gallon from October's $3.86 peak average over the next few weeks, providing a lift for the economy and possibly becoming a factor in next month's presidential election. \n \n Gasoline, now averaging $3.67 a gallon, is expected to fall to $3.35 or lower by late November. In some regions, prices have already sunk below $3. \n \n \"Most of the country is heading appreciably lower the next few weeks,'' says Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service, who notes wholesale prices in some key markets have dropped from as high as $4.35 a gallon to $2.71. Pump prices typically lag big wholesale drops. But Kloza expects retail prices to sink five to 15 cents a gallon over each of the next three weeks. \n \n The drop could provide a boost to consumer spending and influence next month's presidential race, where gas prices have been a hot-button issue for much of the campaign. Several battleground states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are enjoying big price drops. \n \n \"Certainly, lower gas prices are helpful in terms of consumer spending by increasing disposable income,'' says Brian Bethune, chief economist at Alpha Economic Foresights. \"And if prices come down at a rapid rate in the next three weeks, that would tend to help the incumbent. It may not be logical, but if people see problems with the high cost of food or gas, it's the president who tends to get the blame.\" \n \n Gas prices have remained stubbornly high well past their traditional Memorial Day weekend peak, due largely to supply shortages and refinery woes on the West Coast and Midwest. But as oil inventories rise and production issues ebb, prices have been easing the past week, a trend likely to accelerate. \"This is very much gravity at work,'' Kloza says. \"The faster prices soar, the more prone they are to panic sell-offs.\" \n \n \n \n Kloza expects prices to bottom in the $3.30 range. Gasbuddy.com analyst Patrick DeHaan and energy analyst Brian Milne of Telvent DTN see a $3.35 bottom. Barring rising troubles in the Middle East or refinery issues in the U.S., prices could remain in that range through early 2013. \n \n On Friday, gasbuddy.com was tracking some central Ohio stations selling gas for $2.97 a gallon. Gas prices remain stubbornly high in California -- the nation's priciest state averaging $4.51 a gallon -- although some stations are charging more than $5. Energy experts expect prices to bottom in the $4 range. \"California is not completely out of the woods yet regarding supplies, and their refineries haven't been able to keep up,'' Milne says. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/R9HuSk",

DPRK is short for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. \n \n Citing what it called the United States' \"nuclear blackmail and threat,\" the North said it that it, too, would \"take corresponding military actions.\" \n \n Pyongyang had already reacted angrily to the B-52 flights, warning Wednesday of \"strong military counteraction\" if the planes made more sorties over the Korean Peninsula. \n \n Angry words after new sanctions \n \n Tensions have spiked in the region since North Korea carried out its latest underground nuclear test last month, the first under its new young leader Kim Jong Un, prompting the United Nations Security Council to respond by toughening sanctions on the secretive regime. \n \n The sanctions enraged the North further, and during the week when the Security Council was voting on them, it ratcheted up its threats, suggesting it could carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States and South Korea. \n \n Although analysts and American officials say Pyongyang is still a long way from being able to carry out such an attack on the U.S. mainland, the United States' bases in Japan and Guam appear to be within range of the North's conventional weapons. \n \n In its comments Thursday, \"the Kim Jong Un regime is just firing back\" at its enemies in response to the B-52 flights and the military exercises of which they're a part, said Lee Jung-hoon, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. \n \n He said that the U.N. sanctions were also likely to be fueling the North's ire, but that the regime's threats were largely driven by domestic concerns. \n \n \"They're doing all this to prop up the regime,\" Lee said. \n \n The military first strategy \n \n Since Kim took over from his father as the head of the North Korean government in late 2011, he appears to have maintained the pursuit of a stronger military deterrent rather than adopting a more conciliatory approach to relations with South Korea and the United States. \n \n The result has been a major foreign policy headache for U.S. President Barack Obama, with Kim showing more interest in dialogue with the basketball star Dennis Rodman than U.S. diplomats. \n \n As well as the nuclear test, his government has conducted two long-range rocket launches -- one that failed and one that succeeded -- both of which were widely viewed as tests of ballistic missile technology. \n \n Kim has also revamped the military's leadership, ousting some generals and promoting others. \n \n The nuclear test and rocket launches have shattered hopes of any new talks on the North's nuclear program in the near future. \n \n Indeed, Pyongyang has said recently that the program is not up for negotiation and announced that previous nonaggression treaties with Seoul no longer apply. \n \n A new North Korea \n \n The regime's unabashed declarations about its nuclear weapons, which it had been much cagier about in the past, show that \"it's not the same North Korea as 10 years ago,\" Lee said. \n \n The United States and other global powers need to \"formulate a whole new strategy\" to address the changed situation, according to Lee. \n \n \"The way we've been dealing with it for the past two decades has failed,\" he said of the regime. \"It has become close to being able to deploy nuclear weapons.\" \n \n Although U.S. officials say they don't believe North Korea is in a position to strike the United States at the moment, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week announced plans to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack. \n \n \"The reason that we are doing what we are doing, and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security, is to not take any chances, is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency,\" Hagel said at the time.",

    "document": "By \n \n An English historian has come across the word \u2018fuck\u2019 in a court case dating to the year 1310, making it the earliest known reference to the swear word. \n \n Dr Paul Booth of Keele University spotted the name in \u2018Roger Fuckebythenavele\u2019 in the Chester county court plea rolls beginning on December 8, 1310. The man was being named three times part of a process to be outlawed, with the final mention coming on September 28, 1311. \n \n Dr Booth believes that \u201cthis surname is presumably a nickname. I suggest it could either mean an actual attempt at copulation by an inexperienced youth, later reported by a rejected girlfriend, or an equivalent of the word \u2018dimwit\u2019 i.e. a man who might think that that was the correct way to go about it.\u201d \n \n Prior to Dr. Booth\u2019s discovery, the previous earliest use of the word was in them poem Flen flyys, written around 1475. It had a line that read \u201cfvccant vvivys of heli\u201d, a Latin/English mix meaning \u201c\u2026they fuck the wives of Ely\u201d. Historians have come across earlier uses of the word in medieval England, but have doubted that it was being used as a sexual reference. For example, the name John le Fucker appears in 1278, but this likely could be just a different spelling for the word \u2018fulcher\u2019 which means soldier. \n \n In his book, The F Word, Jesse Sheidlower explains \u201cfuck is a word of Germanic origin. It is related to words in several other Germanic languages, such as Dutch, German, and Swedish, that have sexual meanings as well as meaning such as \u2018to strike\u2019 or \u2018to move back and forth\u2019.\u201d \n \n Dr Paul Booth is the Honouray Senior Research Fellow in History at Keele University and Co-Director of the Arts and Humanities Research Council Project: Gascon Rolls, 1317-1468. He plans on publishing an article about his discovery in the journal Notes and Queries. \n \n See also: By God\u2019s Bones: Medieval Swear Words ||||| 19th Century drawing by Jean Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maximilien de Waldeck via The British Museum \n \n A historian in the UK just made an exciting discovery that's changing our understanding of the word \"fuck.\" \n \n Paul Booth, an honorary senior research fellow in history at Keele University, was recently digging around in the Chester county court plea rolls from December 8, 1310\u2014and really, who hasn't dug around in there? That was when he came upon three write-ups from the court clerk, telling the sad story of a guy with the unenviable name of Roger Fuckebythenavele, or seemingly: \"Roger the Navel-Fucker.\" \n \n According to Themedievalists.org \"fuck\" popped up seemingly by accident in 1278 as part of a translation of the German word \"fulcher,\" meaning soldier. That really wouldn't count. This, on the other hand, would be the first instance of the word being used the way we use it today, beating out recent discoveries like the one from around 1475, or one found last year from 1528. \n \n Here is Roger the Navel-Fucker's story in its entirety, courtesy of the UK's National Archives. \n \n 1. County court of Chester, held on Tuesday after the feast of St Nicholas, 4 Edw. II, before Payn Tibotot, justiciar of Chester (8th December, 1310) A man called \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\" was exacted for the first time [the process preliminary to outlawry]. \n \n \n \n 2. County court of Chester, held on Tuesday after the feast of the Ascension, 4 Edw. II, before Payn Tibotot, justiciar of Chester (25th May, 1311) Roger Fukkebythenavele, exacted. \n \n \n \n 3. County court of Chester, held on Tuesday the vigil of Michaelmas, 5 Edw. II, before Payn Tibotot, justiciar of Chester (28th September, 1311) Roger Fuckebythenavel', outlawed. \n \n What just happened to poor Roger? Granted, being \"outlawed,\" means banished, but why the horrible moniker? Was the court clerk just being a dick, or is that Roger's real last name? To find out, we got in touch with Paul Booth, the guy who made the discovery, to ask for his expert opinion on what all this means. \n \n VICE: What's the significance of this discovery? \n \n Paul Booth: The significance is the occurrence of (possibly) the earliest known use of the word \"fuck\" that clearly has a sexual connotation. \n \n What were you doing when you found this? \n \n Part of what I am doing in my retirement is to study the legal records of Cheshire for the turbulent reign of Edward II (1307-27), which are extremely rich. This name simply popped out of the parchment. Roger had failed to answer at the county court, is being solemnly summoned ('exacted') and finally outlawed. \n \n Was the clerk cracking a joke, figuring that Roger would never know about it? \n \n As the name is written three times\u2014spelled slightly differently each time\u2014it is unlikely to be the case of the clerk just inserting a joke name, I think. Even if it were, that does not take away the significance of the use of the word 'fuck' in a name. \n \n So could it be his real name? \n \n If it is a real name\u2014a nickname, presumably\u2014there seem to me to be two possible explanations for its application to Roger. First, that it applies to an actual event\u2014a clumsy attempt at sexual intercourse by an 'Inexperienced Copulator' (my name for Roger), revealed to the world by a revengeful former girlfriend. Fourteenth-century revenge porn perhaps? Or it could be a rather elaborate way of describing someone regarded as a \"halfwit\"\u2014i.e., that is the way that he would think of performing the sexual act. \n \n Will this instance end up in the Oxford English Dictionary? \n \n I have told the OED about it, and it's up to them what they will do. You might like to ask them, and let me know what they say. \n \n Got any other great curse word stories from digging through these archives? \n \n I haven't come across any other names of this type myself, but my pal at Keele, Dr. Philip Morgan, tells me of names such as Hunfridus de aureo testiculo\u2014Humphrey of the golden testicle, and Rogerus deus salvat feminas\u2014Roger God-save-women, as well as the Winchester tenant, Alwin Clawecunt\u2014speaks for itself. \n \n Follow Mike Pearl on Twitter.",

    "document": "A condemned killer's trial was so tainted by the racially influenced decisions of prosecutors that he should be removed from death row and serve a life sentence, a judge ruled Friday in a precedent-setting North Carolina decision. \n \n Superior Court Judge Greg Weeks' decision in the case of Marcus Robinson comes in the first test of a 2009 state law that allows death row prisoners and capital murder defendants to challenge their sentences or prosecutors' decisions with statistics and other evidence beyond documents or witness testimony. \n \n Only Kentucky has a law like North Carolina's Racial Justice Act, which says the prisoner's sentence is reduced to life in prison without parole if the claim is successful. \n \n \"The Racial Justice Act represents a landmark reform in capital sentencing in our state,\" Weeks said in Fayetteville on Friday. \"There are those who disagree with this, but it is the law.\" \n \n Race played a \"persistent, pervasive and distorting role\" in jury selection and couldn't be explained other than that \"prosecutors have intentionally discriminated\" against Robinson and other capital defendants statewide, Weeks said. Prosecutors eliminated black jurors more than twice as often as white jurors, according to a study by two Michigan State University law professors Weeks said he found highly reliable. \n \n Robinson's case is the first of more than 150 pending cases to get an evidentiary hearing before a judge. Prosecutors said they planned to challenge Weeks' decision, and District Attorney Billy West declined further comment. \n \n Weeks ruled race was a factor in prosecution decisions to reject potential black jurors before the murder trial of Robinson, a black man convicted of killing a white teenager in 1991. The jury that convicted Robinson had nine whites, two blacks and one American Indian. \n \n Robinson and co-defendant Roderick Williams Jr. were convicted of murdering 17-year-old Erik Tornblom after the teen gave his killers a ride from a Fayetteville convenience store. Tornblom was forced to drive to a field, where he was shot with a sawed-off shotgun. \n \n Robinson came close to death in January 2007, but a judge blocked his scheduled execution. Williams is serving a life sentence. \n \n Nearly a dozen members of Tornblom's family left the courtroom without commenting. Robinson's mother, Shirley Burns, said she would advocate for the law, which a new Republican majority in the state's General Assembly is trying to eliminate. \n \n \"Everybody is not guilty, everybody is not innocent, but at least be fair,\" Burns said after the ruling. \"It wasn't all about Marcus. It's about anyone who suffers discrimination.\" \n \n Central to Robinson's case was the Michigan State University study. It reported that, of almost 160 people on North Carolina's death row, 31 had all-white juries, and 38 had only one person of color. \n \n Study co-author and Michigan State professor Barbara O'Brien told a North Carolina legislative panel last month the review of more than 7,400 potential capital jurors couldn't find anything other than race to explain why potential black jurors were rejected by prosecutors more than twice as often as whites. \n \n Robinson defense attorney James Ferguson of Charlotte told Weeks, who decided the case without a jury, that the study showed race was a significant factor in almost every one of North Carolina's prosecutorial districts as prosecutors decided to challenge and eliminate black jurors. \n \n \"This case is important because it provides an opportunity for all of us to recognize that race far too often has been a significant factor in jury selection in capital cases,\" Ferguson said when the hearing opened in January. \n \n Union County prosecutor Jonathan Perry, who helped the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office argue the case against Robinson, said the study was untrustworthy because it was based on a too-limited sample of death penalty cases to provide meaningful results. The study also failed to detect numerous nonracial reasons that a person might be struck from a jury, Perry said. \n \n The Republican-led Legislature tried to repeal the Racial Justice Act earlier this year, but lawmakers failed to override a veto by Gov. Beverly Perdue, a Democrat. \n \n In 1998, Kentucky was the first state to enact a similar law. But the American Bar Association said in a report it was unclear exactly how often it has been used except for during the 2003 trial of an African-American man accused of kidnapping and killing his ex-girlfriend, who was white. In that case, the defendant's lawyers used the Kentucky Racial Justice Act during jury selection to include questions that would address the issue of racial discrimination. The defendant, Nathaniel Wood, was convicted of wanton murder and other crimes and sentenced to life in prison without parole. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Janet Cappiello contributed to this report from Louisville, Ky. ||||| Prosecutors called other prosecutors, judges and a political scientist to bolster their claims that race is not among their considerations when weighing whether to strike a potential juror. \n \n That study found that qualified black jurors \u0096 those not released for cause, such as opposition to the death penalty \u0096 were struck by prosecutors at nearly twice the rate as qualified white jurors. In Cumberland County, they were struck at 2.6 times the rate, according to the researchers. \n \n Defense attorneys used a sweeping study of capital cases in North Carolina done by Michigan State University law school researchers to bolster their claims. \n \n In selecting that panel, Robinson\u0092s defense team claimed, prosecutors struck half the blacks eligible for the jury and only 15 percent of those who were not black. \n \n Defense attorneys for Robinson argued earlier this year that prosecutors struck blacks from the jury pool at a much higher rate than whites. The jury that sent Robinson to death row included nine white jurors, one American Indian and two blacks, according to court filings. \n \n Cases he has presided over: In the mid-1990s, he presided over the court proceedings in Robeson County against the two men accused of killing James Jordan, father of basketball star Michael Jordan. \n \n Other legal jobs: Weeks worked several years in private practice and was an assistant Cumberland County public defender for 10 years. \n \n On the bench: 23 years. Recently announced plans to retire at the end of this year. \n \n \u2014 Marcus Reymond Robinson will soon gather his few belongings from the cell on North Carolina\u2019s death row where he has spent the past 18 years and make a historic move to a maximum-security prison cell. \n \n The 39-year-old convicted murderer is the first North Carolina death row inmate to have his sentence converted to life without possibility of parole using the state\u2019s fledgling and unique Racial Justice Act. \n \n Under the 2-1/2-year-old law, Judge Gregory Weeks was able to weigh statistics while considering Robinson\u2019s claims that racial bias played a role in his trial and sentence. \n \n Prosecutors announced plans to appeal the Robinson decision, a challenge that could slow rulings in similar claims from 154 other death row inmates. \n \n Weeks, Cumberland County\u2019s chief resident Superior Court judge, read a summary of his findings Friday in a courtroom full of people keenly aware that they were witnessing a landmark ruling. \n \n Robinson, wearing a white shirt and light-colored pants, sat at a table with his lawyers. The family of Erik Tornblom, the man Robinson killed in 1994, watched silently, though the disappointment showing on their faces spoke volumes. The family left the courthouse without commenting. \n \n Weeks said that \u201crace was a materially, practically and statistically significant factor\u201d in the selection of a jury for Robinson\u2019s trial. \n \n Prosecutors, according to a Michigan State University Law School study, used peremptory challenges to remove blacks from juries more than twice as often throughout North Carolina as they used them for whites. \n \n In Cumberland County, it was almost three times as often. \n \n \u201cWhen the government\u2019s choice of jurors is tainted with racial bias, that overt wall casts down over the parties, the jury and the court to adhere to the law throughout the trial,\u201d Weeks said. \u201cThe very integrity of the court is jeopardized when a prosecutor\u2019s discrimination invites cynicism respecting the jury\u2019s neutrality and undermines public confidence.\u201d \n \n Effect on other cases \n \n Weeks\u2019 findings that potential black jurors systematically had been left out of the process of capital cases in North Carolina and Cumberland County at the time of Robinson\u2019s trial could play significantly in the cases of other death row inmates. Weeks said such decisions by prosecutors to strike African-Americans from potential jury pools undermined the courts and had a sweeping impact on the integrity and trust the community could place in the process. \n \n Only a few inmates on North Carolina\u2019s death row did not file Racial Justice Act claims. \n \n The ruling, the first of its kind in this country, came two days before the 25th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that opened the door for states to adopt such laws as the Racial Justice Act. \n \n North Carolina and Kentucky are the only two states that have done so, though. \n \n The Racial Justice Act, which was narrowly adopted in 2009 along party lines, has been praised by supporters as a way to address blatant and subtle racism undermining the integrity of the state\u2019s courts. \n \n Weeks had harsh words for prosecutors, saying the evidence presented earlier this year by Robinson\u2019s attorneys was enough \u201cto support an inference of intentional discrimination.\u201d \n \n The judge and many of the defense lawyers and death penalty critics said they hoped the ruling Friday would mark the beginning of a new chapter in North Carolina justice. \n \n \u201cWe had hoped for this decision, we had worked for this decision. We thought the judge\u2019s decision was powerful,\u201d said James Ferguson, a Charlotte civil rights attorney who represented Robinson. \u201cWe know our work is not over, but we think this is a beginning.\u201d \n \n District attorneys issued a statement strongly disputing that race is a significant factor in capital murder cases. \n \n Legal scholars and death row critics from across the nation have watched with interest as the Robinson case went through the courts. \n \n \u201cThe North Carolina legislation is a commendable attempt to do what the Supreme Court attempted to brush under the tablecloth,\u201d said James Acker, a criminal justice professor at the State University of New York-Albany who is putting on a symposium this weekend about the death penalty and race.

A judge reduced the sentence of Marcus Reymond Robinson to life without parole after ruling that prosecutors purposely sought to keep blacks off his jury, reports the News & Observer of Raleigh. The landmark ruling is the first under the state's Racial Justice Act, and about 150 other death row inmates in the state have cases pending, notes AP. Among other things, the law allows the judge to take statistical patterns on race into account. In this case, Robinson's legal team showed that prosecutors rejected about 50% of potential black jurors and only 15% of non-black jurors. The jury ended up with only two black people. That disparity is enough \"to support an inference of intentional discrimination,\" wrote the judge, according to the New York Times. Robinson was convicted of murdering a white teenager in 1994.",

Handley Drive in east Fort Worth about two weeks ago, Bush said. \n \n The building owner found the unattended bodies shortly before 8 a.m. Tuesday and called police, Bush said. \n \n Homicide investigators executed a search warrant about noon on suspicion of abuse of a corpse, a felony, according to Bush\u2019s news release. \n \n Johnson said some of the bodies had been embalmed and were ready to be interred. Others were in caskets and ready to be moved. One was ready to be shipped to Nairobi, Kenya, Johnson said. \n \n The bodies that had not been embalmed were covered in black garbage bags, Johnson said. \n \n The building does not have a refrigeration system for the bodies, Johnson said, explaining that refrigeration is not required under state law. \n \n \u201cWe are operating legally,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf we had not been operating legally they would have taken me away in handcuffs.\u201d \n \n No one had been arrested by late Tuesday, Bush said.

This morning, the owner checked on the property and found the business had been left unattended with multiple dead bodies inside, authorities say. \n \n Officers are still searching the funeral home, and officials from the medical examiner\u2019s office began removing the bodies this afternoon. The charge on the search warrant is abuse of corpse, said Sgt. Raymond Bush, a Fort Worth police spokesman. \n \n Bush said it\u2019s too early in the investigation to release the condition of the bodies or how long they were left unattended. The electricity and air conditioning were still on inside the building. The main concern at this point is to return the bodies to the families. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s our priority to find closure for the families,\u201d Bush said. \n \n Any family members concerned about their loved ones\u2019 remains should call the Tarrant County medical examiner\u2019s office at 817-920-5700, Ext. 5. \n \n The Johnson Family Mortuary, started by twin brothers Derrick and Dondre, has had an active funeral director\u2019s license with the state since July 2011 and is current through the end of this month. The funeral home has no previous disciplinary history with the Texas Funeral Service Commission. \n \n Benetha Johnson said she worked with the Johnson brothers previously.

Later they were mentored by noted Fort Worth pastor and funeral director Gregory Spencer, who was found strangled at an Arlington motel in June 2003 (a Louisiana parolee was sentenced to life in prison for the murder). \n \n Three years later the twins struck out on their own, turning an abandoned casket store into the D & D Johnson Funeral Home, and later Johnson Family Mortuary. \n \n \u201cBoth locally and abroad, \u2018The Twins,\u2019 as they are fondly referred, have raised the bar of funeral service,\u201d their website says. \u201cTheir presentation is unparalleled and their service is incomparable.\u201d \n \n There are five complaints currently open against Johnson Family Mortuary, though officials with the commission can\u2019t talk about them until they are closed.

Phil Murphy, who tweeted the storm was worse than forecast, was slated to hold a briefing Friday. \n \n NJ Transit bus passengers were told to expect substantial delays and cancellations Friday because many drivers, who inched their vehicles in the snow and ice, worked past their normal schedules and federal law mandated a rest period for them. \n \n The delays for buses caused a logjam of commuters Thursday, forcing officials to close the doors at New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal. \n \n The wintry weather caused a traffic nightmare on a 30-mile stretch of Interstate 78 in Pennsylvania, with numerous vehicles stuck for several hours from the Lehigh Valley to the New Jersey state line. Police sometimes drove on the opposite side of highway, honking their horns to wake up drivers who had fallen asleep. \n \n About 105,000 homes and businesses were without power Friday in Pennsylvania, mostly in the western part of the state. \n \n Some areas of Massachusetts received more than nine inches of snow in the storm, which turned to rain overnight to complicate the morning commute. \n \n The towns of Topsfield, Carlisle and Billerica, northwest of Boston, were among the towns that got more than nine inches of snow, the National Weather Service said. Boston got less than three inches. \n \n State police said a stretch of the Massachusetts Turnpike east was closed Friday morning after several tractor-trailer crashes. \n \n Many schools in northern New England were delayed or closed after the region saw anywhere from four to eight inches of snow. Interstate speeds in New Hampshire and Maine were lowered to 45 mph. \n \n Schools were closed or were opening with delays in upstate New York, including in the Albany and Syracuse areas. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Karen Matthews in New York, Bob Salsberg in Boston, Kathy McCormack in Concord, N.H., and Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, N.J., contributed to this story.",

    "concatenated_intermediate": "\u2013 A mix of rain, snow, and ice that initially hit the Midwest caused headaches from the South to the Northeast, leaving up to a foot of snow in some parts of the latter and widespread freezing rain and ice accumulations elsewhere. Conditions prompted school closures, hours-long delays for commuters, and hundreds of flight cancellations. Some 200,000 customers in four states were without power at 6pm ET Friday, according to Poweroutage.us, in part due to freezing rain. The snow in the Northeast was expected to end Saturday morning, though gusty winds and coastal flooding will continue, the National Weather Service said. Another cold front will drop additional snowfall from the Great Lakes to the New England interior through Sunday. Weather-related deaths: The wintry weather contributed to traffic crashes that killed people in several states, authorities say. A 60-year-old woman died Thursday in Miami County, Indiana, after she lost control of her vehicle and crashed in slick road conditions, the state's police said. One person was also killed Thursday in Canton, Ohio, and another in Maryland, police say. In Mississippi, a tour bus crashed Wednesday, killing two people and wounding several others. The cause of the crash was weather-related. Arkansas Highway Patrol reported two separate incidents in which three \u2013 More than 35 million people along the Philadelphia-to-Boston corridor rushed to get home and settle in Friday as a fearsome storm swirled in with the potential for hurricane-force winds and 1 to 3 feet of snow that could paralyze the Northeast for days. Snow was blowing sideways with ever-increasing intensity in New York City by Friday morning as flurries began in Boston. More than 40 deaths were blamed on the storm, with shoveling snow and breathing carbon monoxide together claiming nearly as many lives as car crashes. More on the region's chaotic morning commutes: Fatal car crashes were reported in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania, where public transportation was shut down and thousands of flights were canceled, the AP reports. Up to 30 inches of snow was expected to hit the Boston area, with other parts of the Northeast getting as much as 10 inches. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that the city \"would have told people to stay home and cleared the roads,\" but \"in the end, there's also going to be times when Mother Nature is just stronger than us, and sometimes we're gonna be playing catch-up. And this was certainly one of those times.\" He promised to be \"more conservative\" in the future about telling New Yorkers to stay off \u2013 The first snowfall of the season lingered Friday in the Northeast as thousands of exhausted commuters pointed their fingers at politicians and meteorologists for leaving them creeping along highways or stuck in mass transit hubs because of a storm that left seven dead as it moved through the Midwest and South. Some students in West Orange, NJ, were forced to sleep at their schools after their buses turned back, while others were taken to a diner to eat because snow-covered roads were clogged with traffic Thursday, per the AP. They were not alone in finding the ride home difficult. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie tweeted it took him nearly six hours to travel a distance that normally would take 45 minutes. Bridges and major roads in the New York metropolitan area reopened Friday after many closures caused by crashes during Thursday's storm. Some drivers woke up Friday morning after being stuck overnight on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. Accidents on the George Washington Bridge halted traffic on the crossing and led to backups in New York and New Jersey. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he understands why people are frustrated that city officials were caught off guard by a snowstorm that stranded some New Yorkers in their cars for hours. De Blasio said on New York 1 Friday that the city \"will do a full review of",

    "document": "After first testing the idea of using drones to deliver packages to extra remote locations, UPS is making its move into more residential skies with octocopters that can be launched from roving trucks. \n \n The company says it successfully tested the HorseFly drone yesterday in Lithia, FL, along with the company that built both the drone and the electric UPS vehicle that launches it, Workhorse Group. \n \n The drone docks on the roof of the delivery truck, and a cage suspended beneath it extends through a hatch into the vehicle. A driver on the inside loads a package into the cage, presses a button on a touch screen, and sends the drone flying on a preset autonomous route to its destination. \n \n The battery-powered HorseFly drones recharge during docking, and have a 30-minute flight time limit, carrying a package weighing up to 10 pounds. \n \n For this test, UPS launched the vehicle from the roof of a truck about a quarter mile away to a blueberry farm. The octocopter delivered its payload at a home on the property and then flew back to the truck, which had moved down the road to allow its driver to make another delivery. \n \n UPS says the system is different from its other drone work thus far, and could make the company\u2019s network more efficient while reducing emissions. \n \n \u201cIt has implications for future deliveries, especially in rural locations where our package cars often have to travel miles to make a single delivery,\u201d said Mark Wallace, UPS senior vice president of global engineering and sustainability. \u201cImagine a triangular delivery route where the stops are miles apart by road. Sending a drone from a package car to make just one of those deliveries can reduce costly miles driven.\u201d \n \n As always with these tests, it\u2019s worth noting are still obstacles to drone deliveries: Federal Aviation Administration regulations don\u2019t allow commercial drones to fly over any humans not involved in operating them, and requires them to stay within line of sight of their pilots at all times \u2014 something drivers could ostensibly do from their trucks in this case, depending on how far away the destination is. \n \n Elsewhere in the delivery-drone-filled skies, Amazon completed its first residential drone-delivery in England in December, and recently filed a patent for a drone that could drop off packages by way of parachutes, electromagnets, or spring coils. ||||| On a blueberry farm outside of Tampa, Florida, on Monday, UPS tested the use of drones for residential delivery for the first time. \n \n The logistics juggernaut specifically launched an octocopter, or multi-rotor drone, from the top of a delivery van. The drone delivered a package directly to a home, then returned to the van which had now moved down the road to a new location. The van pulled the drone down with robotic arms, to dock on its roof. \n \n The drone used in Monday\u2019s test was made by Ohio-based Workhorse Group Inc., already a UPS technology supplier. Workhorse builds commercial, hybrid electric trucks, batteries and develops aerospace technologies as well. UPS has purchased 350 of its electric hybrid trucks, 125 of which are already on the road today. The company\u2019s new HorseFly UAV Delivery system used in the UPS test was tailored to work with its vehicles. \n \n The truck for the test was custom-built to be able to launch the HorseFly drone from its roof, then grab it upon its return with robotic arms. A cage suspended beneath the drone extends through a hatch in the truck, where the drone can be lowered down and loaded up with another package. While docked, the drone recharges through a physical connection between its arms and the truck\u2019s electric battery. \n \n The concept of delivery vans that launch drones is not new. Mercedes Benz and drone tech startup Matternet revealed plans to develop \u201cVision Vans,\u201d which launch Matternet\u2019s delivery drones from Mercedes-Benzs trucks, back in September of 2016. They unveiled a real world version of the delivery vans at CES, as well. \n \n According to UPS Vice President of Engineering, John Dodero, the company\u2019s goal is to have drones work off of any type of vehicle, whether gas-powered or electric, to make last-mile deliveries. \u201cThat nest that we have on top of the car would be able to be put on any car, but we have to make sure it has the capabilities and it\u2019s set up to do the charging,\u201d he explains. \n \n As for the HorseFly itself, the 9.5-pound drone features a carbon fiber construction, is powered by a proprietary lithium 18650 battery pack, and capable of a 30-minute flight time at a top speed of 45 miles per hour, the company says. By contrast, most consumer drones will only fly for about 22 minutes. The HorseFly can carry a package up to 10 pounds, allowing UPS to handle a wide range of residential deliveries.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Don't be too nervous if you were in Lithia, Fla., earlier in the week and spotted a UPS truck launching a device from its roof to a nearby blueberry farm. It was all part of a test of a new drone-delivery feature the company hopes to bring to residential areas, Consumerist reports. The Workhorse Group's HorseFly unit\u2014which can buzz along for about a half-hour, carrying packages that don't exceed 10 pounds\u2014traveled a quarter-mile or so from the truck to the farm, dropped off its package, then circled back to find the UPS truck, on its way to a new destination. TechCrunch reviewed the test runs and said the process \"still needs work,\" noting that interference caused one launch to be aborted. Reuters reports the experiment followed on the tail of a UPS announcement that automation and new technology were high on the company's priority list. Mark Wallace, a UPS senior VP, explains to Consumerist that rural areas could be a particularly viable place for the truck-launched drones, as a truck could settle in the middle of a \"triangular delivery route\" and send the drone to different destinations. Another UPS exec, John Dodero, tells Reuters that there's no set timeline for getting the drones into wider circulation because federal regulations are in flux. FAA rules, for example, currently require commercial drones to stay in operators' view, and they can only buzz over their operators, not other people. (Inc. notes the risk to those below if the drone malfunctions and drops the package.) One thing Dodero can speak clearly to: \"UPS is never looking to replace our UPS drivers,\" he tells Reuters. (Amazon has also been experimenting with drone delivery.)",

The AHA, which receives most of its funding from industry groups, excused these and other incidents by saying that they were unintentional, or that because they happened off-camera, they don\u2019t count. Most of Baum\u2019s sources are anonymous, but there are a few jaw-droppingly wrongheaded quotes, like this one: \n \n In an interview with THR, Candy Spelling, a national AHA board member, defends the organization\u2019s intent behind the \u201cNo Animals Were Harmed\u201d end credit. \u201cI think what people think [it means] is that when a horse dies in the movies, it didn\u2019t really die,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that people think [the AHA\u2019s monitoring] is just when the cameras are rolling.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Right. No one cares if you punch, step on, or starve animals as long as there\u2019s no camera turned on nearby. If that\u2019s the best defense the AHA can come up with, I hope the Department of Agriculture, the governmental agency usually tasked with protecting animals from neglect and abuse, begins sending agents to Hollywood very, very soon. Baum\u2019s article is the kind of public interest journalism that ought to result in policy changes, and the entire thing is worth reading. ||||| These releases reflect the views of the issuing entity and are not reviewed or edited by the Sacramento Bee staff. More information on PR Newswire can be found on their web site . You can contact the service with questions or concerns here \n \n /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Hollywood Reporter recently ran a story that distorts the work and record of a respected nonprofit organization that has kept millions of beloved animal actors safe on film and television sets around the world for more than 70 years. \n \n (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20101108/DC97343LOGO) \n \n The article paints a picture that is completely unrecognizable to us or anyone who knows American Humane Association's work. Far from allowing abuse or neglect to occur, we have a remarkably high safety record of 99.98 percent on set. Over a span of many years, despite our best efforts, there have occasionally been rare accidents, most of them minor and not intentional. Regrettably, there have even been some deaths, which upset us greatly, but in many of the cases reported, they had nothing to do with the animals' treatment on set, or occurred when the animals were not under our care. For example: \n \n The article claimed that a dog suffering from cancer died during the production of \"Our Idiot Brother.\" Sadly, a dog did take ill and was indeed diagnosed with cancer, but the illness was not work-related and was not due to any activity related to production. \n \n Sadly, a dog did take ill and was indeed diagnosed with cancer, but the illness was not work-related and was not due to any activity related to production. The article suggested that a horse died during post-production after being filmed for \"War Horse.\" What it does not say however is that AHA's jurisdiction does not extend to post-production and transit. In fact, the horse mentioned finished its work and was checked out of production. In transit home, according to a veterinarian, it died of natural causes. \n \n The article seemed to lay blame for 27 animal deaths during \"The Hobbit\" when in fact the animals were not under AHA's jurisdiction or authority in any way. We only monitor animals when they are on the set. When we heard reports months afterwards that animals might have died on a working farm there, we voluntarily sent representatives out to the farm to inspect it and make safety recommendations, which were instituted by production at considerable cost, ensuring better welfare for all the animals on the farm. We were transparent with all the details and our outrage over the regrettable loss of life. Here is our official public statement we made at the time for the record: http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/aha-the-hobbit-animal-deaths.html \n \n When a Certified Safety Representative is on the set and an incident occurs, the animal stops working, is given veterinary care and not allowed to return to work until it is reported sound by the attending veterinarian. This practice is vital. Recognizing injury is vital to preventing abuse from occurring, thus providing humane protections for animal actors. Although the article criticizes the distinction between accidental injury and intentional harm, that is precisely why the program exists - to reasonably make that distinction. This program is about prevention and as with any good safety program, American Humane Association is continually improving . \n \n Under the new senior administration of American Humane Association, a comprehensive program review of the No Animals Were Harmed\u00ae program was conducted in 2011 and 2012. These actions are bringing about game-changing innovations and enhancements that are being implemented to further increase the rigor of the safety standards while improving the quality of oversight for enhanced protections for animals working in entertainment. This new administration has made broad, sweeping changes for enhanced protections for animals working in film and entertainment. These changes were necessary, mission-driven, and will continue to build a better and safer future for the animals we love. The improvements include: \n \n 1) The creation of a Scientific Advisory Committee, composed of global experts in animal welfare, who are right now reviewing our comprehensive and science-based \"Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Filmed Media\" \u2013 the bible of the industry \u2013 to make sure we are doing everything possible to protect animal actors and include the newest findings and research on animal welfare \n \n 2) We have brought on Dr. Kwane Stewart, a respected veterinarian, to head the program and bring a new level of rigor and science to our mission and passion to protect the animals in our care \n \n 3) As part of our efforts to further improve safety, we recently posted positions to hire licensed veterinarians to serve as our Certified Safety Representatives, and place them in geographic areas across the country where high volumes of filmmaking occurs, including Texas, New Mexico, New York, and Louisiana. We are top-tiering our staff to bring an even higher level of expertise to our important work, and basing our safety reps closer to sets, which will help keep down travel and housing costs for the charity \n \n 4) Earlier this year, we implemented a policy that if any animal is seriously injured or dies on set to commission an independent, third-party investigation to find out what happened so that we may prevent as much as is possible such incidents in the future \n \n American Humane Association has made tough changes to ensure that the No Animals Were Harmed\u00ae program is structured to meet the humane charter with which we have been entrusted. It's all about the animal actors and ensuring their safety . Abuse in film and entertainment is not pervasive, as the salacious headlines imply; rather our experience is that most everyone we work with in production settings want to do right by the animals, as do we. \n \n We are extremely proud of the work American Humane Association has done for more than 70 years to protect millions of animals on movie and television production sets. We are a mission-driven small nonprofit that has not only worked to protect animals working in film and entertainment across the country and around the globe, we have done so by utilizing millions of dollars of our own funds so that the certified animal safety representatives could be on more than 2,000 sets a year, making sure that some 100,000 of our most beloved animal co-stars are treated humanely and kept safe each and every year. \n \n For us, the welfare of the animals always comes first, which is reflected by our remarkable safety rate of 99.98 percent. Our overall record for years is one of caring and success. \n \n SOURCE American Humane Association \n \n \u0095 Read more articles by American Humane Association",

A man still able to draw crowds to his live shows, where he casually jokes to \"Be careful about drinking around me.\" A man recently feted with an exhibition at The National Museum of African Art. A millionaire many times over. Poor, poor Bill Cosby. It's so hurtful that more than two dozen women have accused him of sexually assaulting them. What a difficult time this must be for him. How fortunate there are other men in the world with the integrity to not \"kick him when he's down.\" \n \n In an illuminating glimpse backstage into the recent \"SNL 40\" celebration, comic Norm McDonald Wednesday described what it was like to hang out with Paul McCartney and Sarah Palin \u2013 and revealed the Eddie Murphy Bill Cosby bit that never was. As McDonald recalled it on Twitter, the original idea was to have Murphy part of the \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch. As he explained, writer Steve Higgins had \"an idea that would blow the show wide open.\" He said, \"The category would be potent potables, a common one on Jeopardy, but one we somehow had never done. And the idea was that it would be a bar set. And the idea was that Cosby would be mixing a drink in a video that was taped 6 months ago\u2026. The iconic doors would open and on to home base would step Eddie Murphy. The audience would know what to do. Why is Eddie wearing a multi-colored sweater? He steps behind the bar, begins mixing a drink. The audience covers the fact he has not spoken. When he speaks, he is Cosby. Eddie Murphy doing a perfect Cosby impression. The audience does not let him finish. The sketch ends.\" That was the plan, anyway. Eventually, he says, it was \"my job to talk [Murphy] into doing Jeopardy. We talk in his dressing room a good hour. When it's over, I'm convinced he'll do it. He doesn't. He knew the laughs would bring the house down. Eddie Murphy knows what will work on SNL better than any one. Eddie decides the laughs are not worth it.

Murphy, who hadn't returned to the SNL studio in more than three decades, only ended up on stage for 70 seconds, and all he did was give thanks for \"being remembered for his contribution to the show,\" People reports. But the writers originally wanted Murphy to play Bill Cosby in a Celebrity Jeopardy sketch that would also feature Macdonald as Burt Reynolds. It was Macdonald's job to convince Murphy, and they talked it over for \"a good hour,\" Macdonald tweeted. The idea was a video Daily Double with the category of \"potent potables,\" Macdonald said, in which \"Cosby would be mixing a drink in a video that was taped 6 months ago.\" So what was the problem? Murphy \"knew the laughs would bring the house down. Eddie Murphy knows what will work on SNL better than any one,\" Macdonald tweeted. But \"Eddie decides the laughs are not worth it. He will not kick a man when he is down. Eddie Murphy, I realize, is not like the rest of us. Eddie does not need the laughs.\" According to the Daily Beast, Cosby responded to the Murphy story by saying, \"I am very appreciative of Eddie and I applaud his actions.\" Over at Salon, Mary Elizabeth Williams scoffs at the idea that Cosby is \"down,\" writing, \"You don\u2019t want to do a bit, don\u2019t do a bit, but don\u2019t you dare turn it into an 'Aw, shucks, let\u2019s go easy on the guy.

AFP \n \n A 62-year-old man died while taking part in a hunt in the Paris area after being charged by a deer that fatally gored him with its antlers. \n \n The incident occurred around 10am (0900 GMT) in the Compiegne forest, about 85 kilometres (53 miles) northeast of Paris. \n \n The man was acting as a beater, who normally help corner the animal in a certain area, when he was struck. \n \n He \"was charged and pierced by a deer which stabbed him with his antlers,\" a police spokesman said. The hunter, who was not carrying a rifle, died of internal bleeding before emergency services could arrive. Police said this type of death was \"uncommon\". \n \n Guy Harl\u00e9, the president of the local hunters federation said: \"Normally the animal would flee, but this time he decided to charge. It came after him. \n \n \"The antlers of the stag are like many knives piercing you, there is nothing you can do. This tragic accident reminds us that we do not play with a wild animal. There is an inherent risk with hunting,\" said Harl\u00e9. \n \n The victim was named as Regis Levasseur. He was due to get married in the coming months. \n \n \"For him, hunting was more than a hobby, it was his life,\" said Harl\u00e9. \n \n The killing of the hunter by a deer comes just a week after there was an outcry in France after hunters and their hounds tracked a stag to the garden of a private house before shooting it at close range (see video below). \n \n The incident took place in the town of Lacroix-Saint-Ouen, on the edge of the Compiegne forest, not far from where Regis Lavasseur was gored. \n \n It prompted France's environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, to slam hunting with hounds as \"a practice from another century\" that \"prolongs the agony\" of the animal. \n \n Animal rights groups launched petitions calling for hunting to be banned and protests were held in nearby towns. The hunting group involved in the incident was banned for a month and the hunter who shot the deer was subject to death threats. \n \n For Harl\u00e9 from the hunters federation the fatal goring of his fellow hunter was an answer to those who had criticized those who had shot the stag. \n \n \"Here we have the painful illustration of the danger that a wild animal can represent,\" he said. \n \n \"What would have happened at Lacroix-Saint-Ouen if the stag had charged around the neighborhood? This should serve as a lesson.\" \n \n There was less sympathy for that argument on Twitter where many linked the two incidents together with the hashtag \"#karma\". \n \n The death of the hunter in Compiegne comes after several tragic accidents since the start of the season in September when hunters have accidentally shot each other. \n \n In one incident a grandfather killed his own grandson during a hunt in the Vend\u00e9e, western France. And last month a woman was shot dead in her garden after a bullet from a hunter's gun passed through her garden hedge. \n \n Although it is rare for someone not involved in the hunt to be killed it does happen, with walkers, mushroom pickers and even motorists killed by stray bullets in recent years. \n \n France's national hunting office insist that the majority of accidents are carried out by people not respecting the rules of the hunt. \n \n According to La Depeche newspaper 27 percent of hunting accidents in France are due to mishandling of the firearm and 17 percent due to hunters firing off bullets without having identified a definite target. \n \n Last year 18 people were killed in hunting accidents in France and 351 have been killed since 2001, but most of the victims were involved in the hunt.",

Later, Riyadh conceded Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated murder, but that the murder was an unplanned \"rogue operation\". \n \n However, Erdogan has accused the \"highest levels\" of the Saudi government of ordering the hit, while some officials have pointed the finger at the crown prince - a charge Riyadh denies. \n \n Meeting with Trump \n \n Speaking before his departure, Erdogan also said he might meet with US President Donald Trump in Paris during the commemorations. \n \n \"When we go to Paris, we will try to secure an opportunity and we will realise a bilateral meeting,\" Erdogan said. \n \n {articleGUID} \n \n Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal, reporting from Istanbul, said the timing of Erdogan's comments was \"very significant\". \n \n \"It happened as he was getting on the plane to go to Paris to meet with Trump.

It's a matter of people 20 years ago making some bad drinks-buying decisions. \n \n Making bourbon is, in a sense, an attempt at trying to predict the future. What will the world be like 20 or so years from now, the whiskey maker must ask herself, and just how much bourbon might they want there? So to a large extent, our current shortfall is due to people in the 1990s underestimating how much bourbon we'd want to drink today \u2014 possibly because 1990s drinkers had worse taste in alcoholic beverages. (Curse you, Zima.) \n \n Advertisement \n \n The good news is, if bourbon-makers undershoot the mark with their production, they can always make more. The ingredients are not hard to come by. The bad news? Every new barrel starts its own new clock on the aging process. Is it possible to reset that clock, though? \n \n There's an interesting piece up in Nautilus today detailing some of the strange methods whiskey-makers are experimenting with to speed up the bourbon aging process, with everything from ultrasonic energy bursts to basically throwing in a whole bunch of oak chips and shaking. While the new methods certainly sound fun, this taste description sounds a little less fun: \n \n Sponsored \n \n Spirits aged for shorter amounts of time (four months instead of the two years minimum for federally approved straight bourbon, for example), have an edgy taste, often described as \"hot,\" \"raw,\" or \"aggressive,\" with a \"shorter finish.\" \n \n Of course, not every bourbon is required to mellow for decades before it's poured; plenty can and do take considerably less time. But, the longer it's allowed to mellow, the more likely that any jagged notes in the flavor will have had time to soften. So much so that if the whiskey you're selling is less than four years old, you're required by federal whiskey law (yes, it's a thing) to slap a label on the bottle alerting potential customers to that fact (let no one say they didn't try to warn you). \n \n The good news hidden in all this is that a bourbon shortage is by its very nature, a temporary thing. The bad news is that a solution, at least by traditional brewing methods, is always at least a decade or so away. But fear not! The future bourbon that will save us from a dispiriting future of offers of sad vodka-cranberries and weird little pickled onion martinis is already brewing. It's just not ready to arrive quite yet. \n \n Image: : Olga_Phoenix / Shutterstock ||||| In case you haven\u2019t heard, doomsday is coming\u2014more droughts, floods, famine, class warfare, entitled children, and, brace yourself: a bourbon shortage! Yes, traditional Kentucky distillers didn\u2019t predict or prepare for this Mad Men-inspired mixology epoch. And if it continues on this trajectory, thousands of years from now geologists and archaeologists will be able to identify the bourbon-free era in the absence of fancy rectangular bottles in the remains of fallen civilizations. \n \n That is, unless scientists can build a whiskey time machine, a way to gracefully cheat the slow aging process that offers bourbon its rich oaky tones and sweet and smooth finish. \n \n The popularity of bourbon in the past decade has been a major high and hangover for American distillers. (The name \u201cbourbon\u201d is reserved for barrel-aged whiskeys made primarily of corn in the United States.) In 2002, the U.S. sold 13 million cases of bourbon; in 2014, 19 million cases, generating $2.7 billion in revenue. But the popularity and the time bourbon takes to mature, paired with a shortage of new American oak barrels that traditional whiskeys are aged in, means there simply isn\u2019t enough of the good stuff to go around. Evidence of a shortage is generally delivered in anecdotes, but in an independent opinion survey taken this year by Fred Minnick, booze blogger and author of Whiskey Women: The Untold Story of How Women Saved Bourbon, Scotch & Irish Whiskey, 82 percent of 149 high-end bourbon drinkers said they have been unable to find bourbons they once found. \n \n Scientifically savvy distillers have already squeezed the slow aging process into months and weeks. \n \n It is the finest bourbons, those that are produced in limited supply and aged for 12, 18, or more years that have been the hardest to find in the past several years. Drinkers with deep pockets have bought up much of the limited release bourbons from well-established companies\u2014Van Winkle, Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, Four Roses Limited Editions\u2014explains Lew Bryson, the managing editor of Whisky Advocate magazine. \u201cHaving cleared them off the market, they\u2019ve now started in on lesser-known bourbons, almost in a panic-buying mode, buying multiple bottles of whiskeys they feel sure will simply disappear.\u201d \n \n Also in Chemistry Authenticity in the Age of the Fake By Philip Ball The announcement of synthetic diamonds in 1955 was met with the same kind of alarm and skepticism that greeted claims to have made alchemical gold in the Middle Ages.

Through a variety of unconventional aging methods, drawing on chemistry, they have already squeezed a two- to more-than-20-year process into days, weeks, and months, much to the chagrin of whiskey connoisseurs, who will tell you the secret to a refined bourbon is time. While some companies have taken age labels off their bottles to get products to market sooner (bye-bye 12-year-old premium bourbon; hello ambiguously aged premium bourbon), new distilleries are experimenting with smaller barrels and rapid oxidation. \n \n The magic that turns harsh ethanol, the product of distillation, into a sophisticated sip of smooth bourbon with undertones of vanilla and caramel happens when young alcohol meets oak barrel. Whiskey aging traditionally starts when an oak barrel is charred, breaking down the lignin in the wood into organic compounds called aldehydes, explains Scott Spolverino, an industry consultant with a degree in brewing and distilling science from Heriot-Watt University, in Scotland. \u201cThese are the main building blocks of maturation.\u201d When you add alcohol to the barrel, oxidation transforms the aldehydes into acids\u2014syringic acid (from syringaldehyde), ferulic acid (from coniferaldehyde), and vanillic acid (from vanillin). During the aging process, changes in heat and pressure push and pull the alcohol in and out of the wood. There is a constant back-and-forth between aldehyde and acid, until the acids accumulate en masse and turn permanently into esters, adding complex character and deep flavors. \n \n \u201cTime in the barrel is like sandpaper, smoothing out the rough edges,\u201d says Liza Weisstuch, who writes regularly for Whisky Magazine and the Whisky Advocate. \n \n But a host of new distillers don\u2019t want to wait years to start cashing in on their hefty investments. One entrepreneur trying to cheat Father Time is Tuthilltown Spirits in Gardiner, New York, makers of Hudson Baby Bourbon and Hudson Four Grain Bourbon. When it opened in 2003, Tuthilltown started experimenting with accelerating the maturation of single malt, rye, and bourbon whiskeys by letting the alcohol settle in 2- to 5-gallon oak barrels, instead of the industry-standard 53- to 55-gallon oak casks, increasing the alcohol-to-barrel-surface ratio. \n \n \u201cThe small barrels sped up aging significantly; we could get to market in months, instead of years,\u201d says Tuthilltown co-owner Ralph Erenzo, a rock climber who originally wanted Tuthilltown to be a climbers\u2019 ranch. Erenzo and his crew were able to get their whiskey to market in about four months, and they discovered they liked the more pronounced vanilla flavor they were getting by using small barrels. Ten years out, and with the luxury of time, they have grown into bigger barrels\u2014using, for the most part, a mix of 10-, 26-, and 53-gallon casks. But they still have a reserve of 3- to 5-gallon whiskey that they blend with bigger batches so they can \u201cget that character profile that people liked all along,\u201d Erenzo says. In 2010 Tuthilltown sold its Hudson line to William Grant & Sons Distillers, makers of Glenfiddich single malt Scotch whiskies and Hendrick\u2019s Gin. \n \n Spirits aged for short amounts have an edgy taste often described as \u201chot,\u201d \u201craw\u201d or \u201caggressive.\u201d \n \n At Copper Fox Distillery in Sperryville, Virginia, makers of Wasmund\u2019s Single Malt Whisky and Copper Fox Rye Whisky, head distiller and owner Rick Wasmund adds toasted oak chips to his 53-gallon barrels, agitating them to increase the alcohol-to-surface ratio and exposing them to heat and cold. You can try your hand at similar bourbon aging methods at home with something called Time & Oak\u2014an oak stick with comb-like grooves that activates \u201caccelerated transpiration through capillary action\u201d\u2014the same theory behind smaller barrels and oak chips. \n \n Terressentia, near Charleston, South Carolina, which specializes in bulk bourbon (sold in 6,000-gallon tankers), uses increased oxidation to mimic aging and take impurities out of young whiskeys, explains Terressentia CEO Earl Hewlette. Terressentia starts with undrinkable 4- to 6-month-old whiskey because they want their whiskey to be brown\u2014something you can\u2019t get without time in an oak barrel. They filter it in plastic tanks with a technology that expedites the aldehyde and acid dance, creating drinkable esters\u2014chemical compounds\u2014in just eight hours. According to Hewlette, the process has the added benefit of turning some of the fatty acids from the original fermented grains into glycerides, which act as a smoothing agent, taking the bite out of the final product. \u201cWhen the bourbon shortage came along, it gave us a whole new market,\u201d says Hewlette, noting that the same bigger companies who used to sell in bulk have been hoarding their own limited supplies. \n \n Tom Lix, owner of the Cleveland Whiskey Company, uses steel tanks with wood segments under pressure. \u201cOne of the reasons behind working on the technology we use and starting this business was an anticipation of this shortage well in advance of when other people started talking about it,\u201d he says. Lix also boasts that his Cleveland Black Reserve 100-proof spirit, the company\u2019s bourbon, holds its own in taste tests against established brand Knob Creek. \n \n Bourbon made in less than a year may be financially savvy, but most bourbon experts say it falls short on taste. \u201cI don\u2019t think new methods are producing whiskey that is comparable,\u201d Bryson says. \u201cSome accelerated whiskeys don\u2019t feel right. They feel too thin; they don\u2019t have the proper \u2018roundness.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Spolverino explains: \u201cWhen you\u2019re aging a spirit for a short amount of time, the aldehydes and acids don\u2019t have time to come together.\u201d Meaning those raw flavors in fast-tracked whiskeys often come from an overabundance of aldehydes. \u201cAdding more wood to the situation just adds more of those beginning aldehydes, it doesn\u2019t actually speed up the process,\u201d he says. Spirits aged for shorter amounts of time (four months instead of the two years minimum for federally approved straight bourbon, for example), have an edgy taste, often described as \u201chot,\u201d \u201craw,\u201d or \u201caggressive,\u201d with a \u201cshorter finish.\u201d Spolverino has done research into an ultrasonic-energy treatment. \u201cIt could physically push the spirit deeper into the barrel staves to draw out more aldehydes and provide catalytic energy for reactions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not entirely sure it could speed up the esterification process.\u201d \n \n Many of the big distillers stepped up production of high-end whiskey five years ago, when word of a shortage started to spread. And there has always been a plentiful supply of non-premium brands: Jim Beam White, Evan Williams Black, Knob Creek, Woodford Reserve, Maker\u2019s Mark, 1792, explains Bryson. Most of the big companies dismiss accelerated aging. Mark Brown, CEO of Buffalo Trace, one of Kentucky\u2019s larger bourbon distilling operations, says the company has spent $10 million on research and development on how to make quality whiskey, not on how to cheat time. \n \n \u201cThe work done by others over the past 50 years aimed at expediting the aging process does not appear to have resulted in the production of a superior whiskey, quite the opposite,\u201d says the company\u2019s Master Distiller, Harlen Wheatley. \u201cWe\u2019re glad people are exploring these [new] techniques,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBut generally it only reinforces the need for time in the barrel.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n Tasha Eichenseher is a hot-toddy-sipping, freelance science and environment writer (and a senior editor at Yoga Journal) in Boulder, Colorado.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's been rumored for a few years now; Nautilus' take on the looming \"bourbon shortage\" is that it already has hit. Though we're awash with Knob Creek and Maker's Mark, high-end and small-batch bourbons are in short supply, spurring well-heeled drinkers to clear the next tier of bourbon from the shelves. As io9 explains, the reason we've arrived at this point can be distilled down to some poor predictions made as many as 20 years ago when the golden liquid filling today's premium bottles started being made. Basically, distillers didn't predict just how much demand would swell in this decade, and the Wall Street Journal reported in September that they've been burned before: They jacked up production in the 1970s, but demand plunged and prices followed. But Nautilus places us in a \"Mad Men-inspired mixology epoch,\" stacking up the 19 million cases of bourbon sold last year to the 13 million sold in 2002. And while actual data detailing the shortage is hard to come by, one independent survey by writer Fred Minnick finds that 82% of 149 \"high-end\" bourbon drinkers report not being able to get their hands on certain bourbons right now. More on why: The aging process is what takes the edge off bourbon, so much so that anything aged less than 4 years must be labeled as such; many fine bourbons are aged 18 or more years. Nautilus takes a look at how some makers are attempting to hack down that timeline: by using oak barrels much smaller than the standard size or adding oak chips to regular-size ones in order to balloon the \"alcohol-to-barrel-surface ratio,\" for instance. But for those who want the real, decade-aged deal, \"there simply isn\u2019t enough of the good stuff to go around,\" observes Nautilus.

    "document": "WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Aug. 18, 2015 - Shorter mothers have shorter pregnancies, smaller babies, and higher risk for a preterm birth. New research has found that a mother's height directly influences her risk for preterm birth. \n \n Investigators at the March of Dimes Prematurity Research Center Ohio Collaborative looked at 3,485 Nordic women and their babies, and found that maternal height, which is determined by genetic factors, helped shape the fetal environment, influencing the length of pregnancy and frequency of prematurity. In contrast, birth length and birth weight are mainly influenced by transmitted genes. Preterm birth is the number one killer of newborns in the United States and serious gaps exist between racial and ethnic groups. \n \n More than 450,000 babies are born too soon in the U.S. and the national preterm birth rate is worse than many other high-resource countries, the March of Dimes says. Worldwide, 15 million babies are born preterm, and more than one million die due to complications of an early birth. Babies who survive an early birth face serious and lifelong health problems, including breathing problems, jaundice, vision loss, cerebral palsy and intellectual delays. \n \n \"A major goal of the nationwide network of March of Dimes prematurity research centers is identifying genes that govern fetal growth and length of pregnancy. That a woman's height influences gestational length, independent of the genes she passes on that determine fetal size, is a major finding by our research networks, and the first of what we expect to be many genetic contributions,\" said Joe Leigh Simpson, MD, March of Dimes senior vice president for Research and Global Programs. \n \n \"The innovative, team-based model of our prematurity research centers is critical to understanding the unknown causes or preterm birth. This new finding adds one small piece toward solving the much larger puzzle of preterm birth,\" says Dr. Jennifer L. Howse, president of the March of Dimes. \n \n The March of Dimes is raising $75 million to support its five prematurity research centers. These unique, transdisciplinary centers bring together the brightest minds from many diverse disciplines -- geneticists, molecular biologists, epidemiologists, engineers, computer scientists, and others -- to work together to find answers to prevent premature birth. In addition to the Ohio Collaborative, the March of Dimes has established research centers at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, at the University of Pennsylvania, at Washington University in St. Louis, and at the University of Chicago, Northwestern University and Duke University. \n \n \"Our finding shows that a mother's height has a direct impact on how long her pregnancy lasts,\" said Louis Muglia, MD, PhD, the primary investigator of the Ohio Collaborative, and co-director of the Perinatal Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. \"The explanation for why this happens is unclear but could depend not only on unknown genes but also on woman's lifetime of nutrition and her environment.\" \n \n ### \n \n The research paper, \"Assessing the Causal Relationship of Maternal Height on Birth Size and Gestational Age at Birth: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis,\" was published online Aug. 18 by PLoS Medicine. \n \n The March of Dimes works to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality.

Thus, understanding the determinants of fetal growth and the duration of pregnancy are essential to improve both newborn and later-in-life health. Epidemiological evidence has suggested that these birth outcomes are shaped by intrauterine environment, but the relative contribution of maternal genetic, fetal genetic, and nongenetic factors that may drive epigenetic physiological adaptations remains incompletely understood. Moreover, should fetal genetics shape these outcomes, their direct involvement in the risk for the adult diseases, as well, is an intriguing possibility. Recently, to better understand normal fetal growth in healthy pregnancy, a multinational longitudinal assessment has been reported [61]. These data demonstrate similar average growth profiles across geographic populations but do not define the mechanisms for variability within a given population. \n \n In this study, we observed the consistent associations between maternal height and birth length, birth weight, and gestational age in each of the three study cohorts. The estimated effect sizes of the observed associations were respectively ~0.05 cm/cm for birth length, ~10 g/cm for birth weight, and ~0.34 d/cm for gestational age per 1 cm change in maternal height, which are in the same range as previous reports for fetal growth [20] and gestational age [15]. We then disentangled causal relationships underlying these observational associations. \n \n Based on an extensive list of height-associated SNPs (n = 697) reported by a recent large GWA meta-analysis [40], we constructed a height genetic score as a powerful genetic instrument for maternal height. In our study samples, the genotype-based genetic score explained a substantial fraction (~20%) of variance in maternal height. This percentage was even larger than that (~16%) reported in the original study [40], which is likely due to the homogeneity of our samples (i.e., all females with northern European origin and a more restricted age distribution). Our previous studies have shown that the height genetic score explained larger variance in females than males [62,63]. \n \n We observed significant associations of maternal height genetic score with birth length, with birth weight, and, to a lesser extent, with gestational age. As the genetic score captures the genetic variation in maternal height, these significant associations suggested either direct causal influence (Fig 1A) of maternal height or fetal genetic effect (Fig 1C) rather than confounding effects (Fig 1B), although the latter mechanism could not be excluded. It should be emphasized that maternal genetic score is not a valid instrument for maternal height, unless adjusted for fetal genotype; thus, it cannot be used to differentiate the causal effect of maternal height (Fig 1A) from fetal genetic effect (Fig 1C). \n \n We further probed the causal impacts of maternal height using genetic instruments either based on maternal genetic score without or with adjustment for fetal genetic score (method 1 and 2) and maternal nontransmitted haplotype score (method 3). The results strongly suggested that the observed correlations between maternal height and birth length or birth weight were mainly due to fetal genetic effects but not due to nongenetic intrauterine effect (i.e., maternal height as an environmental factor that casually influences fetal growth). Multiple lines of evidence consistently supported this conclusion. \n \n First, we observed significant association of fetal genetic score with birth length and birth weight, and after controlling for fetal genetic score, the associations between maternal genetic score with birth length and weight were no longer significant, which suggests substantial fetal genetic influence. This observation was in line with previous studies, which showed that the magnitudes of associations between paternal height with either birth length or birth weight were comparable to maternal height [20,21,64]. Genetic analyses of parent-offspring data [6,11] also suggested fetal genetics explain more variation in birth size. \n \n Second, our haplotype-based genetic score analysis showed that both maternal transmitted genetic score and paternal transmitted genetic score were highly significantly associated with birth length and birth weight, but the nontransmitted score was not (particularly for birth weight), which again indicated that maternal height has relatively minimal effect on birth length or birth weight if not transmitted genetically. The nontransmitted score was marginally associated with birth length, which suggests some direct causal effect of maternal height on birth length, and the estimated causal effect size was similar to the observational effect (~0.05 cm change in birth length per 1 cm change in maternal height). \n \n Thirdly, our single marker analysis indicated that those adult height-associated SNPs were excessively associated with birth length and birth weight in fetus, but the estimated effect sizes of these SNPs on birth length and birth weight were not well correlated with their effect on maternal height, which indicated direct but different functional effects of these SNPs on fetal growth rather than a common causal effect mediated through maternal height. The inference of the parental transmission in mother-child pairs also allows us to examine parent-of-origin effects of those height-associated SNPs on birth length and weight. Our results showed excessive differences between the maternal and paternal transmitted alleles. For birth weight, the effect sizes of the maternal transmitted alleles were generally larger than paternal transmitted ones. \n \n We also performed the analysis using gestation-adjusted birthweight percentiles (converted to z-scores) as the outcome and obtained similar results (S8 Table). This evidence collectively suggests that birth weight and birth length are mainly defined by fetal genetics. Therefore, it is difficult to define abnormality of fetal growth in a general term (e.g., by deviation from population mean) without taking genetic variance into account. It should be noted that the samples of the current study were collected from high-resource northern European countries, with presumably good nutrition throughout childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy, enabling the mothers and their infants to grow to their full genetic potential. This fact might account for why we observed a predominant influence of genetic factors on birth size in this study. The conclusion may not be directly transferrable to low- or middle-income countries, where malnutrition may substantially constrain one\u2019s growth and significantly change the association between maternal height and fetal growth [24,25]. \n \n In contrast with the findings in birth length and birth weight, we observed evidence that suggested gestational age at birth might be causally influenced by maternal height, in which case maternal height might operate as an important factor that shapes the intrauterine environment and influence the gestational age. Again, this conclusion was supported by multiple lines of evidence: (i) gestational age was (marginally) associated with maternal height genetic score but not with fetal height genetic score, and after adjustment for fetal genetics, the association between gestational age and maternal height genetic score were still significant; (ii) gestational age was associated with maternal nontransmitted haplotype genetic score, which indicated the effect of maternal height on gestational age was transmitted through phenotypic causal mechanism rather than genetic inheritance (i.e., transmission of alleles); (iii) the estimated causal effect of 0.4 d/cm of maternal height on gestational age was similar to the size from observational association; and (iv) single-marker analysis indicated that those adult height SNPs were excessively associated with gestational age, and the estimated effect sizes of these SNPs (in mothers) on gestational age, although relatively low, were correlated with their effect on maternal height, which suggested the effect of these SNPs is projected through a common intermediate (i.e., maternal height) rather than through SNP-specific pathways (biological pleiotropy). \n \n We also performed analysis using preterm status as a dichotomous outcome, and the results (S9 Table) indicated that shorter maternal height is a risk factor for preterm birth (observational association p = 3.77 \u00d7 10\u22126, with an estimated 3% increase in risk if the mothers are 1 cm shorter). This result was consistent with a recent epidemiology study [18]. Genetic score analysis also showed significant association between preterm birth risk and the nontransmitted haplotype score (p = 0.0456), which suggests that maternal height causally influences preterm birth risk. \n \n We recognize that the association between maternal non-transmitted haplotype score and gestational age was only modestly significant (meta p = 0.0424), and it was mainly driven by the DNBC cohort (p = 0.018) and was not significant in the other two cohorts. Also, gestational age in the DNBC cohort was estimated by combining information from self-reported data and gestational age reported in birth registry, while it was estimated by ultrasound in the other two cohorts. However, our meta-analysis did not reveal any sign of inconsistency\u2014the confidence intervals of the estimates from different cohorts overlap and the p-value for the heterogeneity test was not significant. Nevertheless, the error-free validity of this association needs to be confirmed by further replication studies in independent cohorts.",

Researchers looked at the height and weight of more than 5,400 women and found that the taller a woman was, the greater her risk of giving birth to a baby that weighed 30 pounds or more, the New York Times reports. The study, published in PLoS Medicine, also found that shorter birth lengths and heavier birth weights were linked to a woman's risk of having a child that weighed more than 35 pounds.

Obama said his announcement this week is simply designed to help keep families together in the face of that congressional inaction, and he urged Congress to take the steps that would make his unilateral moves dispensable. \n \n \"The day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary,\" Obama said during Thursday's speech. \n \n Such statements, however, have done nothing to appease Republicans, who are furious with what they consider an unconstitutional power grab by a president they say has habitually abused his executive power. \n \n Scores of Republicans issued statements Thursday night suggesting that Obama, by his action, just made it harder for lawmakers to reach a deal on broader reforms. \n \n \"By ignoring the will of the American people, President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,\" Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement. \"His \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach makes it harder to build the trust with the American people that is necessary to get things done on behalf of the country.\" \n \n Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), a former federal prosecutor, said Democrats' argument that past presidents have taken similar actions simply doesn't fly with GOP lawmakers. \n \n \"Attempts to undermine the law via executive fiat, regardless of motivation, are dangerous,\" Gowdy said in a statement. \"Whether previous administrations acted outside of constitutional boundaries is not license to do the same.\" \n \n Democrats, for their part, reject the notion that Obama's actions reduce the odds that Congress can pass legislation. They're quick to note that Boehner and the Republicans had the entirety of the 113th Congress to consider a bill before Obama acted Thursday but declined to do so. \n \n \"They are trying to poison the well by saying the president shouldn't do this,\" Pelosi said. \n \n \"But the fact is that I think many of our [Republican] colleagues here understand that we have to do this.\" ||||| Ahead of President Obama's prime-time address announcing his plans to take executive action on immigration policy, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) released this message saying Obama actions are not \"how our democracy works.\" (YouTube/John Boehner) \n \n Ahead of President Obama's prime-time address announcing his plans to take executive action on immigration policy, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) released this message saying Obama actions are not \"how our democracy works.\" (YouTube/John Boehner) \n \n Just two weeks ago, Republicans handed President Obama a humiliating defeat at the polls, winning full control of Congress. But already, party leaders fear that the conservative uproar over the president\u2019s immigration actions will doom any hopes for a stable period of GOP governance. \n \n The moves announced Thursday night by Obama \u2014 which will protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation \u2014 have sparked an immediate and widening rebellion among tea party lawmakers that top Republicans are struggling to contain. \n \n Despite expanded powers and some new titles, soon-to-be Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) remain sharply limited in their ability to persuade their most conservative members. The duo has been thrust back into the same cycle of intraparty warfare that has largely defined the GOP during the Obama years and that has hurt the party\u2019s brand among the broader electorate. \n \n \u201cIt is the first real challenge for Boehner and McConnell together,\u201d said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), a Boehner ally. \u201cThey\u2019d like to wipe the slate clean for when they start up next year, with this situation behind us.\u201d \n \n In his prime-time speech from the East Room of the White House, Obama blamed Republicans for forcing his hand by refusing to approve immigration reform and told them, \u201cPass a bill.\u201d He also cast the issue in moral terms, quoting Scripture to bolster his case. \n \n During his speech on immigration reform, President Obama called on illegal immigrants to \"come out of the shadows\" and \"get right with the law.\" (AP) \n \n But comprehensive immigration reform is unlikely to pass a Republican-held Congress, because of partisan hostilities in Washington. Still, GOP leaders badly want to show the country that the party can govern constructively, even if it is not clear whether they can keep their raucous conference united. \n \n McConnell and Boehner, for example, want to approve a long-term spending bill at least through the early part of next year \u2014 part of an effort to limit theatrical confrontations with Obama and focus on tax reform and other Republican-friendly issues. \n \n But conservatives inside and outside Congress want to use the budget process as a battleground to wage war against Obama and his immigration program. The proposed gambit raises the specter of another government shutdown, akin to the one that damaged Republicans last year. \n \n The debate is also a test of whether the party can contain the controversial and sometimes offensive comments that have often hindered attempts to bolster support for Republicans among Hispanics. After tea party firebrand Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said on Wednesday that protected immigrants would become \u201cilliterate\u201d voters, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) winced. \n \n \u201cUnfortunate, unfair, unnecessary, unwise,\u201d said Graham, who is close to party leaders. \n \n Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a moderate from the Philadelphia exurbs, said the leadership is asking his colleagues to \u201cnot play into the president\u2019s hands.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe president wants to see an angry and intemperate response, thinking the Republicans will do something that leads to a shutdown,\u201d Dent said. \u201cDon\u2019t take the bait, and don\u2019t have a hysterical reaction. We can be strong, rational and measured.\u201d \n \n Republican leaders are considering several moves they say would be forceful responses to the president while also keeping the government funded. Ideas being floated include filing a lawsuit over Obama\u2019s executive authority, pursuing stand-alone legislation on immigration policy and removing funding for immigration agencies. \n \n Another option \u2014 funding the government until the end of the fiscal year and then rescinding parts of immigration-related funding \u2014 is favored by the leadership and championed by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.). His office has issued a memo urging members to avoid using government funding as the means of dissent and warning that some immigration agencies would not be affected since they operate on user fees. \n \n \u201cWe are considering a variety of options,\u201d McConnell said Thursday in a floor speech. He suggested that his preference would be for Republicans to avoid becoming mired in a fiscal clash during the lame-duck session, shortly before the GOP takes control of the Senate in January. \n \n Many conservative lawmakers, however, are shrugging off pleas from leadership. Furious with the president, they are planning a series of immediate and hard-line actions that could have sweeping consequences. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said Wednesday that Obama\u2019s executive action should be met with a refusal to vote on any more of his nominees, and on Thursday, he compared the action with the ancient Catiline conspiracy, a plot to overthrow the Roman Republic. \n \n Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), likely the next chairman of the budget committee, has advocated for a series of stopgap spending bills with the intent of pressuring the president to relent. Sessions is the featured speaker at a Heritage Foundation event Friday morning in response to Obama\u2019s moves, a couple of hours after a scheduled Boehner news conference. \n \n And Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) \u2014 one of the loudest voices on the right \u2014 has hinted at bringing up impeachment measures. \u201cWe have constitutional authority to do a string of things. [Impeachment] would be the very last option, but I would not rule it out,\u201d King said Thursday on CNN. \n \n Amid the chatter over strategy, it is the tone of outraged rank-and-file members that most worries GOP elders. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, they do not want to see Republicans tagged by Democrats as hostile toward Latinos and other minorities. \n \n \u201cIt only takes a couple\u201d of comments for an unflattering narrative to build about the Republican response, said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with having some of these new, young punks around here. They ought to listen to us old geezers.\u201d \n \n In the House, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who has been a prominent backer of comprehensive immigration reform, has been counseling House Republicans about the need to show empathy for undocumented workers as the party rails against the Obama administration, according to GOP aides familiar with his deliberations. \n \n Yet the firestorms have continued to flare, with some Republicans, encouraged by grass-roots activists and conservative media personalities, eschewing the party\u2019s more incremental line and making contentious statements. \n \n Speaking with reporters, Bachmann had said the \u201csocial cost\u201d of Obama\u2019s immigration policies would be extensive, with \u201cmillions of unskilled, illiterate, foreign nationals coming into the United States who can\u2019t speak the English language.\u201d \n \n When pressed on why she used the term \u201cilliterate,\u201d Bachmann said, \u201cI\u2019m not using a pejorative term against people who are non-American citizens. I\u2019m only repeating what I heard from Hispanic Americans down at the border.\u201d \n \n On Friday, Bachmann and Steve King plan to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border to meet with officials to showcase their opposition to the president and cast themselves as leading Republican voices. \n \n Other Republicans have called for a proactive legislative response beginning early next year, rallying behind a strategy that would take away government funding as the main battleground and turning toward specific policy areas. \n \n Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a potential presidential candidate, said Republicans must signal that in spite of their disagreements with the president, they are committed to reform. \u201cThis country needs to deal with immigration,\u201d he said in an interview. ||||| Immigration Mitch McConnell promises forceful immigration response The GOP leader did not specify what action his Republican Senate will take next year. \n \n Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised on Thursday morning that Congress will respond forcefully in 2015 to President Barack Obama\u2019s imminent executive action that will defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants. \n \n In a blistering speech that quoted Obama\u2019s past statements about his limited unilateral powers on the subject of immigration, the GOP leader did not specify what action that his Republican Senate will take next year, whether it be zeroing out funding for government agencies in a spending bill, taking the White House to court or taking a confrontational stance to the president\u2019s nominees, as suggested by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n But the Kentucky senator vowed there will be a forceful response from Capitol Hill once his newly minted GOP majority takes over next year. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Obama to shield 5 million from deportation) \n \n \u201cHe needs to understand something. If President Obama acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, Congress will act,\u201d McConnell said ahead of a long Thanksgiving recess that begins Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re considering a variety of options. But make no mistake. When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act.\u201d \n \n McConnell\u2019s remarks also serve to underscore his and other Republican leaders\u2019 effort to avoid any whiff of the threat of a government shutdown when funding runs dry on Dec. 11. Instead, top Republicans are urging measured responses from their rank-and-file, hoping to avoid impeachment and shutdown talk as they mull how precisely they will respond to Obama\u2019s actions and balance the demands of conservative Republicans agitating for a fiery confrontation. \n \n \u201cMy belief is you can\u2019t capitulate, but you need to push back smartly,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cIf you overreact, it becomes about us, not about President Obama.\u201d \n \n (Video: President Obama's full immigration address) \n \n And by planning a response to the White House in 2015, McConnell also would accrue significantly more sway over Capitol Hill\u2019s direction. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) still controls the floor until January \u2014 and both he and Republican leaders have said that in the current divided Congress they are essentially confined to considering whatever House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) can muscle through his chamber to keep the government funded. ||||| Thousands of immigrant-rights activists, families and elected officials cheered across the country as President Barack Obama announced on television his plan for relief from deportations for about 5 million people. \n \n Miriam Lopez,left, Faby Jacome and Dulce Saavedra console each other as they are brought to tears while watching President Obama's speech on executive action on immigration outside the Los Angeles Metropolitan...

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Obama unveiled sweeping actions on immigration reform last night, and while the civil unrest Sen. Tom Coburn warned of hasn't materialized, it's safe to say congressional Republicans are deeply unhappy. Obama criticized Republicans for failing to act and dared them to \"pass a bill,\" but the forceful actions GOP congressional leaders have promised in response are not expected to include immigration reform. More: Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised a tough response when the GOP majority takes office next year, but he didn't spell out any specific actions, Politico reports.

But make no mistake. When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act.\" Possible actions include a lawsuit against the White House or choking off funding to federal agencies. House Speaker John Boehner was among many Republicans who warned that Obama's order will make it tougher to reach compromise on other reforms. \"By ignoring the will of the American people, President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,\" Boehner said in a statement. \"His 'my way or the highway' approach makes it harder to build the trust with the American people that is necessary to get things done on behalf of the country.\" The immigration order not only sets the GOP against Obama, it raises the prospect of yet more intra-GOP conflict, with some conservatives demanding a government shutdown, reports the Washington Post. \"The president wants to see an angry and intemperate response, thinking the Republicans will do something that leads to a shutdown,\" says Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania. \"Don't take the bait, and don't have a hysterical reaction. We can be strong, rational, and measured.\" Democrats were broadly in support of the move to defer deportation for millions, but many called it just the first step in a process that should be completed by Congress, the Hill reports. The move is \"a bold step in the right direction\" but \"not a permanent solution,\" says Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez, the new head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Among those affected by the move, there is some joy and relief, but some feel it didn't go far enough and hope for a longer-term solution, the AP finds. \"This will definitely help our family no longer live in fear, fear that we will have to drop everything if our parents are deported,\" says a 20-year-old woman in Portland whose parents lack legal status. \"But there is still fear, because this is ... temporary, and we need something permanent.\"",

    "document": "By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus and Anthony Salvanto \n \n With the first debate less than two weeks away, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a tight race for the presidency nationally. Clinton has just a 2-point edge in a two-way match-up among likely voters. The race is tied when third party candidates are included. Among the broader electorate of registered voters, Clinton leads Trump by five points. \n \n One disadvantage for Clinton is diminished voter enthusiasm. Democrats are less enthusiastic about voting now than they were in August. \n \n More than four in 10 voters think each presidential candidate should release more of their medical records. This poll was conducted before either candidate\u2019s recent release of medical information. \n \n With Election Day just under eight weeks away, the race for President nationwide is tight. In a two-way match-up, Clinton has a slim edge over Trump, 46 - 44 percent among likely voters who support or lean toward a candidate. \n \n This is the first national poll in which CBS News and the New York Times have measured the presidential race among likely voters. The measure for likely voters takes into account voters\u2019 reported intent to vote, enthusiasm about voting and other factors that historically affect an individual\u2019s decision to vote. \n \n Among the broader electorate \u2013 registered voters nationwide \u2013 Clinton leads Trump by five points, 46 percent to 41 percent. \n \n When third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are factored in, the race is tied, with Trump and Clinton each getting the backing of 42 percent of likely voters. While Clinton and Trump retain most of their support when Johnson and Stein are included, slightly more of Clinton\u2019s supporters move to Johnson or Stein, compared to Trump\u2019s supporters. \n \n Among registered voters, Clinton has a slight edge over Trump in a four-way contest. \n \n Most Clinton and Trump voters say they\u2019re sticking with their candidate. Ninety-two percent of Trump voters and 94 percent of Clinton voters say their choice is set. Few say they will change their minds before the election. \n \n Enthusiasm and Strength of Support \n \n Thirty-six percent of registered voters overall now say they are very enthusiastic about voting, the same as a month ago. But one disadvantage for Clinton is that enthusiasm among Republican voters has remained steady, while enthusiasm among Democrats has dropped. Among Democratic voters, the percentage that is at least somewhat enthusiastic has dropped from 77 percent in August to 64 percent today, while the percentage of Democrats who are very enthusiastic has dropped nine points \u2013 from 47 percent to 38 percent. \n \n More specifically, Trump supporters are more excited about voting than Clinton\u2019s supporters are. Forty-five percent of Trump voters say they are very enthusiastic about voting, compared to 36 percent of Clinton backers who feel that way. \n \n Just over half of each candidate\u2019s voters say they strongly support their candidate, but for many, support is not so strong - including a quarter who are voting for their candidate because they dislike the other choice. \n \n Who\u2019s Supporting Whom? \n \n Trump now garners support from just under nine in ten Republican voters, as does Clinton among Democrats. \n \n A look at the candidates\u2019 demographic support also illustrates why the race is close. A gender gap remains: Trump has a double-digit lead over Clinton among men, while Clinton is ahead by a similar margin among women. Trump continues to struggle with African American voters but has an advantage over Clinton among whites. \n \n Whites without a college degree are strong supporters of Trump (58 percent back him), while Clinton leads Trump among white voters with a college degree. \n \n Clinton is ahead of Trump among voters under 30 but she is not getting the level of support Barack Obama received in 2012. 48 percent of young voters are currently backing her, while Obama won 60 percent of the young vote in 2012. Only 29 percent of young voters are supporting Trump, but 21 percent say they\u2019ll vote for someone else or won\u2019t vote. \n \n The Candidates\u2019 Medical Records \n \n After Clinton\u2019s bout of illness at the 9/11 ceremony and the announcement of her pneumonia diagnosis, more than four in 10 voters think each presidential candidate should release more of their medical records. About as many think the candidates have released enough information about their health already. The poll was conducted before either candidate\u2019s recent release of medical records. \n \n Over half of Republicans think Clinton should release more medical records concerning her health, but 52 percent think their nominee has released enough information already. Among Democrats, most (53 percent) say Clinton has released enough health information already, but want Trump to release more of his records. \n \n This poll was conducted by telephone September 9-13, 2016 among a random sample of 1,753 adults nationwide, including 1,433 registered voters. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News and The New York Times by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. \n \n The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. \n \n Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. \n \n The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. \n \n The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample and the sample of registered voters could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly. \n \n The sample of likely voters is modeled among registered voters (N=1,433), assigning each respondent a probability of voting based on their responses. The margin of error for the sample of likely voters is plus or minus three points. \n \n This poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls. \n \n \n \n ||||| The IT History Society (ITHS) is a world-wide group of over 500 members working together to assist in and promote the documentation, preservation, cataloging, and researching of Information Technology (IT) history.

No, it\u2019s not the first breezes of fall. It\u2019s the aroma of Democratic panic. The latest trigger is a poll that CNN released late Wednesday afternoon. The poll shows Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton 46-41 in Ohio, with Gary Johnson taking 8 percent, and Trump winning 47-44 in Florida, with Gary Johnson at 6 percent. Both figures are based on screening for likely voters, not just registered voters. A national CNN poll last week showed Trump winning by a point 49-48. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be close, but it\u2019s close,\u201d President Obama said at a fundraiser Tuesday night. CNN\u2019s poll of those two crucial battleground states is the latest in a series of polls that have shown good news for Trump. The gap between the two candidates has shrunk to one of its smallest points so far. Not since Trump\u2019s post-Republican National Convention bump has the GOP nominee seemed to be in such a strong position. Certainly, mid-September has been decisive in presidential elections before. John McCain had built a lead over Barack Obama before the economy collapsed on September 15, 2008; McCain never recovered. \n \n Of course, Trump also had farther to go to close that gap: With the exception of that bump, Trump has trailed in the race all along, and what\u2019s changing here is momentum. Polling averages still show Clinton leading, and the forecasts from both FiveThirtyEight (64 percent change of Clinton win) and The Upshot (78 percent chance of Clinton win) show her with the edge. But those numbers have shrunk, and if the current trend continued, she could easily lose. As a Citibank analyst noted, in a comment that seems like it ought to be unnecessary but is not, \u201c35% probability events happen frequently in real life.\u201d It\u2019s that sort of idea that has some liberals flipping out. After all, this was supposed to be an easy contest! How can it be that a candidate who has lied repeatedly and blatantly, insulted minority groups, not bothered to learn anything about policy, and proposed banning Muslims from the country be even close to winning? Just a few months ago, even straight reporters were speculating that the race might be over, and that Trump had practically no way to win. Now, it looks like a nailbiter. Or maybe all of this is wishful thinking from Trump fans and a classic example of what Obama adviser David Plouffe described as bedwetting, the tendency among Democrats to freak out and panic at the slightest sign of trouble. But privately, many Republicans who are horrified by Trump but have taken solace in the expectation that he would lose by a wide margin are starting to freak out too. ||||| In the four-way ballot test, which followed the head-to-head matchup in the list of questions read to likely voters, Hillary Clinton received 41 percent to Donald Trump's 39 percent. | Getty National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 5 \n \n Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by five points in a head-to-head matchup in the latest national poll of likely voters from Quinnipiac University out Wednesday, with the advantage narrowing to just two points in a four-way race. \n \n Matched against only Trump, 48 percent said they would vote for Clinton, with 43 percent choosing the Republican nominee, 3 percent picking someone else and 6 percent undecided. Clinton led by a larger margin in the previous Quinnipiac survey conducted in August, 51 percent to 41 percent. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Regardless of whom they are supporting, majorities voters likely to cast their ballot for Clinton or Trump said their main reason for supporting their candidate was more in opposition of the other option than liking their choice. More than half\u201454 percent of Clinton supporters said opposing Trump was their main reason for backing the Democratic nominee. Approximately two-thirds of likely Trump voters\u201466 percent\u2014said their main reason for supporting him is because they opposed Clinton. \n \n The latest results come as other state and national polls show similarly tightening margins between both major candidates, who have traded words in recent days over concerns about transparency and health. The Quinnipiac poll began last Thursday, a day after the Commander in Chief Forum, and remained active in the field until Tuesday, after days of public attention on Clinton's health following her early departure from a 9/11 memorial on Sunday and subsequent revelation that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia last Friday. \n \n Asked whether they thought the election would be close or one of the candidates would win in a landslide, 69 percent chose the former and 22 percent the latter. \n \n Republicans and Trump supporters were more likely to say the election will be close, while more Democrats and Clinton supporters said their candidate would prevail with ease. \n \n Regardless of the candidate they are supporting, nearly six in 10 likely voters\u201458 percent\u2014said Clinton would win in November, while 31 percent said Trump would be elected. \n \n The usual racial, educational and gender gaps persist in the latest poll, with Clinton holding the support of 54 percent of women in the head-to-head matchup compared to 36 percent for Trump, who received the support of 50 percent of men to Clinton\u2019s 41 percent. Among white voters, Trump leads 51 percent to 41 percent, while among non-whites, Clinton has a 47-point edge of 66 percent to 19 percent. \n \n Among whites holding college degrees, Clinton leads 50 percent to 44 percent, while Trump leads among whites without degrees, 59 percent to 33 percent. \n \n In the four-way ballot test, which followed the head-to-head matchup in the list of questions read to likely voters, Clinton received 41 percent to Trump's 39 percent. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received 13 percent, while the Green Party's Jill Stein took 4 percent, with 3 percent undecided among those choices. \n \n In order to reach the primetime presidential debates, the first of which is scheduled for Sept. 26, third-party candidates must receive an average of 15 percent support in five national polls; however, the Quinnipiac survey is not one of them. \n \n A separate question in the survey showed some support for Johnson\u2019s inclusion in the debates, with 57 percent saying he should be included and 37 percent saying he should not. Support for Johnson\u2019s inclusion was highest among independents (66 percent to 30 percent) and higher among Clinton supporters (60 percent to 33 percent) than Trump backers (50 percent to 46 percent). \n \n The poll was conducted Sept. 8-13, surveying 960 likely voters nationwide via landlines and cellphones. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.",

She has a 5-point lead over Trump, 46% to 41%, in a two-candidate race, and a 2-point lead, 41% to 39%, with Johnson and Stein included.

There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cproof\u201d anymore; the Internet age is proof-proof. If anything, the more evidence you provide, the more pretexts you create for kooks to pose moronic challenges to it. If the White House wants to reassure people that the photos exist, they can show them to Republican leaders, to members of the press, and maybe to 9/11 families for their satisfaction. (Scott Brown apparently has already seen them.) \n \n Two: It\u2019ll warn the jihadis of the world of what awaits if they mess with America. Didn\u2019t the Zarqawi death photos already warn them of that, though? How about killing scores of Al Qaeda commanders with drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere? The fact that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were in hiding for 10 years is pretty solid evidence that they know what happens when you mess with Uncle Sam. \n \n Three: Turnabout is fair play. If we had to endure photos of U.S. troops doing wrong at Abu Ghraib, let\u2019s celebrate the photos of U.S. troops doing right by taking down a monster. I think that\u2019s a better argument for why the Abu Ghraib photos shouldn\u2019t have been released, though, than for why the Bin Laden photos should be. And in fact, Obama agrees: Remember when he broke his promise to the left to release photos of detainee abuse and filed suit to keep them suppressed in the name of national security? Also, Abu Ghraib was a case of exposing government malfeasance, which the public has a right to know about. They may not have a right to the photos, given the propaganda value of those photos to the enemy, but it\u2019s not an apples and apples comparison with a national high-five like killing Bin Laden. \n \n Four: It\u2019s a trophy. People want to see dead Osama\u2019s face because they want to revel in it. They\u2019d put it on t-shirts and coffee mugs even though, according to one of CBS\u2019s sources, it\u2019s beyond gruesome (the \u201cbullet opened his skull, exposing the brain, and it also blew out his eye\u201d). After watching Americans forced to choose between burning alive or jumping to their deaths on 9/11, the thinking goes, we deserve to plaster images of Bin Laden\u2019s cortex on billboards. Fair enough, but I have to say, just knowing how the raid went down and that his skull ended up being popped like a balloon is already \u2026 deeply satisfying. I keep thinking of him in his bedroom, listening to the SEALs banging around downstairs and hyperventilating at the thought of what would happen when they opened the door. I don\u2019t need an extra scoop of sugar on that hot fudge sundae. It\u2019s already tastier than I could have hoped for. \n \n So those are the arguments in favor. The obvious argument against releasing the photo, per Bob Gates and Hillary, is that it\u2019ll \u201cinflame anti-American sentiment\u201d and put troops in the field at greater risk. Didn\u2019t we already cross that bridge, though, by \u2026 killing Osama Bin Laden? And haven\u2019t we heard that same argument used before by our political leaders to pressure people like Terry Jones on free speech? The argument the administration could/should have made is that sometimes we have to accept a greater operational risk in the interest of protecting core values like the First Amendment \u2014 and that this isn\u2019t one of those times, since there\u2019s really no core value that would be served by releasing a \u201csuck it, jihadis\u201d Bin Laden death photo. It would feel great, but as I said above, it already feels great. And the \u201csuck it\u201d message has, I take it, already been received by all the important people via the fact that Osama now literally sleeps with the fishes. \n \n The reason I think this is a good call is that I like the idea of Bin Laden being reduced to an afterthought, even in death. He had already reduced himself to that status after 10 years of hiding like a rat and churning out the occasional audio message that no one paid much attention to. Then, on Sunday, in the span of 12 hours, he went from quietly doing whatever he was still doing for Al Qaeda to quietly having a chunk of his head blown off to quietly being kicked off the deck of a U.S. carrier into the sea. Just like that, gone from the face of the Earth; I\u2019ll bet the carrier crew didn\u2019t even hear the splash. That\u2019s a sweet ending for a messianic fanatic. Release the photo and you undo some of that, though, by treating him like a big enough deal that the world should gawk at his fate. Why give his followers that satisfaction? He wasn\u2019t a big deal. He was to us because we had unfinished business with him, but nearly everyone else \u2014 possibly even Al Qaeda \u2014 had moved on. And now we get to move on too. Next. \n \n Update: Ah, looks like Scott Brown only saw one of the fake photos circulating online. I\u2019m sure the GOP leadership can view the real thing if it asks Obama to make them available. Although Boehner says he doesn\u2019t need to: \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s a decision for the administration to make,\u201d Boehner said when asked if it was necessary to release any of the bin Laden photos, which U.S. officials have described as carrying the gory imprint of a gunshot wound to the head. \u201cThey have to decide what to do. I\u2019m convinced. I have no doubts.\u201d \n \n Update: A Pakistani security official showed up at the compound shortly after the raid ended and snapped a few pics, which he then sold to Reuters.

Slate's complete coverage is rounded up here. \n \n In a world where every form of splatter, dismemberment, and slaughter has found a home on the Web\u2014a place in which tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions have watched blood bubble out of Neda Salehi Agha Soltan's face and pool on the asphalt beneath her head\u2014it seems nuts that President Barack Obama has decided not to release the photos of Osama Bin Laden's bullet-dented cranium.* \n \n In a 60 Minutes interview to be aired Sunday, Obama said he thought it important that \"very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool.\" \n \n White House Press Secretary Jay Carney spoke yesterday about the \"sensitivities involved\" in releasing the \"gruesome\" and potentially \"inflammatory\" photos, and mused about whether allowing their publication would \"serve or in any way harm our interests\" at home and abroad. Today, he said the administration didn't want the photos to become \"icons\" that would help rally support against the United States. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the chairman of the House Intelligence panel, opposes making the photos public for similar reasons, saying he doesn't want the images to \"make the job of our troops serving in places like Iraq and Afghanistan any harder than it already is. The risks of release outweigh the benefits.\" \n \n Obama and Rogers' idea that news should be calibrated by the government to ease the job of the U.S. military makes for a First Amendment loophole you could drive a motorized regiment through. If al-Qaida and its supporters are more irate with the United States this week than they were last week, it's because U.S. commandos killed Bin Laden. Obama should never have marked him for death if tending the \"sensitivities\" of al-Qaida and its allies was U.S. policy. \n \n It's hard to imagine that a death photo of Bin Laden would elevate al-Qaida and its supporters to some fury that his killing didn't. Or, as @knifework tweeted this afternoon, \"Who hasn't shot someone in the face, fed their corpse to the sharks, and then fretted over how their followers would feel about the photo?\" \n \n I don't advocate the photos' release because I think it will convince the unconvincible that Bin Laden is dead or because I desire a \"trophy\" or a football \"spiked,\" as Obama puts it in his 60 Minutes interview. I'm for the publication of the pictures because they're an essential part of the war on al-Qaida. Withholding the photos and couching their suppression in the name of national security misjudges what makes al-Qaida tick and infantilizes the nation. It also sets a precedent for \"news that's too gruesome to reveal.\" \n \n Here's how CBS News reporter David Martin describes the photos, based on a description provided to him: \n \n It does sound very gruesome. Remember, bin Laden was shot twice at close range, once in the chest and once in the head, right above his left eye, and that bullet opened his skull, exposing the brain, and it also blew out his eye. So these are not going to be pictures for the squeamish. \n \n Barbie Zelizer, author of the recent book About To Die: How News Images Move the Public, finds it paradoxical that the administration would recoil from releasing the photos but gladly provides verbal descriptions of the spectacular raid and Bin Laden's killing. \n \n \"You can't have it both ways,\" Zelizer told me in an interview. \n \n The Bin Laden photos, Zelizer says, are \"part of the record, part of the news event\" and locking them away ascribes \"magical powers\" to the photos that wouldn't otherwise exist. If we conceal them from public view, we board a slippery slope that flows toward ignorance, timidity, doubt, and conspiracy-mongering. \n \n \n \n Part of the ambivalence about releasing the photos, Zelizer says, is that a universally accepted narrative for Bin Laden's killing has yet to emerge. As I wrote the day after the raid, the press and the government had huge trouble agreeing exactly how the operation unfolded. Did Bin Laden make a human shield of his wife? Was she killed? Did he shoot at the SEALs? Or did the SEALs summarily execute an unarmed man? \n \n If such an accepted narrative existed, it might be easier for the administration to predict how the photos would be received at home and overseas. But it's not the White House's business to control and manage news for the good of the nation based on some imagined worst-case reaction to events. That's Soviet thinking. \n \n If a nation can be trusted to view the horrors of 9/11 in real time, flip through the Abu Ghraib picture book, witness the made-for-video murder of Daniel Pearl, see images of dead Uday and Qusay on the evening news, and gaze upon pictures of dead soldiers coming home as air freight (photos that President Bush, incidentally, tried to ban in the name of managing the news), then it can be trusted to stomach the last photos of Osama Bin Laden\u2014and whatever turmoil those photos might cause. Why? Because that's what sort of country the United States is. \n \n ****** \n \n What about the helmet-cam video of the operation? Yeah, I'm for its release, too, although I can see the case for why it should be edited to withhold secret operational details that led to the mission's success.

Although there should be no doubt that bin Laden is actually dead, there are grave doubts as to the circumstances surrounding his death. Was he shot in cold blood? Was he shot in the back or in the front? Were his hands raised in surrender? Was he actively resisting? \n \n Many of these doubts could have been resolved if bin Laden's body had been subjected to the usual investigatory techniques routinely employed in homicide cases. His body should have been subjected to an autopsy, to forensic testing by an experienced medical examiner, to extensive photographing of entrance and exit wounds, to paraffin testing for gun-powder residue, and to other such forensic examination. \n \n Editorial Board Member Matt Kaminski on the bin Laden photos. \n \n Burying his body at sea constituted the willful destruction of relevant evidence, which naturally gives rise to suspicions that there was something to hide. I fully credit the administration's explanation that the reason for the hasty burial at sea was the desire not to offend religious Muslims and not to create a shrine to a dead mass murderer. But many reasonable people around the world will wonder whether the decision may also have been based on a desire to suppress the whole truth. \n \n In my nearly half-century of representing defendants charged with homicide, I have come to know that the best evidence of how a person died comes from the body of the deceased. Dead bodies often talk more loudly, clearly and unambiguously than live witnesses. Bin Laden's body should have been preserved as long as necessary to gather all relevant evidence, notwithstanding the requirements of Shariah Law. \n \n When a Muslim or a Jew is the victim of a homicide in the United States, religious considerations do not trump civil requirements. Their bodies are generally sent to the medical examiner for thorough examination. Notwithstanding religious prohibitions, autopsies are performed and organs removed for testing. No special exception should have been made for bin Laden's body. \n \n View Full Image Getty Images Inside Osama Bin Laden's compound, where he was killed during a raid by U.S. special forces \n \n The president's decision to suppress the remaining photographic evidence is disturbing on many levels. First, it is wrong on its merits. The public is used to seeing visual portrayals of dead bodies on television and in movies. Anyone who has served as a juror or a courtroom observer in a homicide case has seen bodies riddled with bullets or afflicted with stab wounds. We are mature enough to endure viewing such visual evidence if we choose to. Nor is there any real risk that these photographs will inflame Muslim or Arab sensibilities any more than the photographs of Saddam Hussein did. \n \n In a democracy, doubts must always be resolved in favor of disclosure, particularly in a matter of such great public interest and controversy. Surely Congress has at least equal authority to decide what to do with the photographs. Moreover, the press may have the right to obtain and publish these highly relevant items of evidence as part of its duty to inform the public. Some media will surely challenge the president's decision\u2014and if they do I hope they win. \n \n The great Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis taught us nearly a century ago that \"sunlight is the best disinfectant.\" The remaining evidence of how bin Laden was killed\u2014the photographs and the results of any forensic tests that may have been hastily performed\u2014should be exposed to the sunlight of publication. \n \n Mr. Dershowitz is a law professor at Harvard.

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) \n \n NEW YORK \u2014 Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli's recent actions could cost him his freedom, even before he's sentenced for his recent criminal conviction on fraud-related charges. \n \n Federal prosecutors late Thursday moved to revoke Shkreli's bail, arguing that his recent conduct \u2014 including purported \"threats and harassment\" against former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential race loser Hillary Clinton \u2014 show he poses a \"danger to the community.\" \n \n In a Brooklyn federal court filing, prosecutors cited the 34-year-old New York pharmaceutical industry entrepreneur's offer of $5,000 to anyone who would \"grab\" some of Clinton's hair for him during her upcoming book tour. \n \n \"Shkreli's latest threat is concerning not only because it has required a significant expenditure of resources by the United States Secret Service, which is charged with protecting Secretary Clinton, but also because there is a significant risk that one of his many social media followers or others who learn of his offers through the media will take his statements seriously \u2014 as has happened previously \u2014 and act on them,\" prosecutors wrote in a legal motion. \n \n U.S. District Court Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, who presided over the trial that ended with Shkreli convicted on three securities fraud-related counts of the eight criminal charges against him, ordered Shkreli's defense team to file a response to the government motion by Tuesday. She scheduled a Sept. 14 hearing for legal arguments on the issue. \n \n Apparently unrepentant, Shkreli wrote in a Thursday night Facebook post: \"Hillary Cliinton's presumptive agents are hard at work. It was just a prank, bro! But still, lock HER up. Spend your resources investigating her, not me!!\" \n \n Shkreli could face up to 20 years in prison for the convictions. However, he has no prior criminal record and is expected to face less serious punishment. His defense lawyers also plan to appeal the convictions. \n \n Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman on Friday filed a motion seeking that seeks to overturn the guilty verdict the Shkreli jury voted against him on a charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Prosecution evidence supporting that charge was \"legally insufficient\" to be weighed by the jury, Brafman argued. \n \n Shkreli has been free on a $5 million bond following his Dec. 2015 arrest on charges he bilked investors in two healthcare industry-focused hedge funds and then improperly took money to repay them from Retrophin, a pharmaceutical company he previously headed. \n \n However, Shkreli is best known to the U.S. public and the world for imposing a 5000% price hike on a medication used to treat a parasitic illness that typically afflicts those infected with the HIV virus or others with weakened immune systems. \n \n Jurors convicted Shkreli on fraud charges, but found him not guilty of the allegations involving Retrophin. \n \n In arguing for bail revocation, prosecutors also said he made at least two public statements in which he harassed specific women near the end of his trial and since his Aug. 4 conviction. \n \n In January, he was banned from Twitter for harassing Lauren Duca, a freelance writer who had authored an opinion essay that criticized President-elect Trump before his Sh. Focusing again on Duca as his trial neared a close, Shkreli wrote in a Facebook post: \"trial's over tomorrow, b------.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Martin Shkreli's lawyer may think his client is \"brilliant beyond words,\" but the convicted pharmaceutical exec's latest move on social media wasn't exactly a genius one. Per LawNews, the Justice Department filed a motion Thursday to revoke Shkreli's $5 million bail after a now-deleted Facebook post he made earlier this week made weirdly threatening comments directed toward Hillary Clinton. \"On HRC's book tour, try to grab a hair from her,\" he wrote, adding he'd compensate anyone who did so for their efforts: \"Will pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton.\" The DOJ says his remarks show he's a \"danger to the community,\" per USA Today. The motion notes that a \"significant expenditure of resources\" now has to be put out by the Secret Service staff tasked with protecting Clinton (she's afforded such protection as a former first lady). Shkreli tried to defuse the situation by posting, \"It was just a prank, bro!\" on Facebook Thursday evening, followed by an expletive-tinged rant against the \"government\" and a dare to \"come at me with you hardest because I haven't seen anything impressive yet.\" Shkreli's attorneys need to file a response to the DOJ motion by Tuesday; a Thursday hearing will follow. (It may be hard for him to concentrate on his eBay auction with all of this going on.)",

    "document": "Another day, another woman scolded for wearing clothes. \n \n A Grand Rapids, Michigan, woman says she was asked to leave a local mall on Saturday for wearing what any woman might wear on a sweltering summer day. Hannah Pewee shared a photo of her outfit and a rundown of her experience at Michigan's Woodland Mall. \n \n \"Apparently some anonymous person reported me to MALL SECURITY for inappropriate dress and I was kicked out,\" she explains. \"Never mind that within a one foot radius there were plenty of girls dressed just like me, since it's NINETY degrees outside. I am so angry right now I'm shaking. I felt so embarrassed I almost cried. All because a stranger didn't like how I dressed.\" \n \n She goes on: \n \n The Woodland Mall should be ashamed of themselves, as well as that anonymous complainer. It's my body, and it's hot outside! I'm not going to show up in jeans and a sweater, sorry. Don't like it? Look away! I was out having a fun time with my sister and next thing I know, I'm out on the street. Slut-shaming how girls are dressed is deplorable and outdated, and it needs to stop. \n \n More than 650 comments and 7,300 shares later, Pewee's post becomes the latest example of dress code policing that tends to disproportionally target women in warmer months. \n \n The Woodland Mall's code of conduct states only the following in regards to customer dress: \n \n Appropriate attire, including shirts and shoes, is required. Clothing with inappropriate words, phrases or graphics is not permitted and is subject to mall management approval. \n \n Excluding attire worn in accord with religious practice, tradition or significance, deliberately obscuring the face is prohibited. \n \n As Pewee noted in a second Facebook post shared later on Saturday, the code has no policy stating expectations for length of shorts. \n \n If there is such a strict policy, that needs to be *public information*, not something security officers spring on unsuspecting customers. Especially with summer coming around, there's going to be a lot of girls like me, going to the mall and not knowing their breaking some secret dress code. \n \n Pewee has since spoken with Woodland Mall management, and has received an apology for the way she was treated: \n \n The mall also issued a public apology to Michigan Live: \n \n We apologized to the shopper and the public for the way that this was handled. We've already spoken to her and are working to make things right. We work to create a fun and safe shopping and dining destination but failed to deliver on that message for this shopper. We're working internally to make sure we fully deliver on excellent experiences at our Mall immediately. \n \n Pewee tells Mashable that retailers should be aware that \"times have changed.\" \n \n \"Style has evolved and they need to be aware that people are going to dress how they want to dress,\" she said. \"If public malls want to have a dress code, that's their choice, but consumers need to be made aware of this dress code so we can decide whether or not we want to shop there.\" ||||| We\u2019re in the middle of the first heat wave of the season, which means your wardrobe probably consists mostly of lightweight, breathable clothing. But last weekend, one Michigan woman faced some serious backlash for what she wore to the mall on 90\u00b0 day. \n \n Hannah Pewee, a college student at Grand State University, spent her Saturday shopping at the Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, wearing standard summer attire: denim cutoff shorts and a Finding Nemo tank top which read \u201cJust Keep Swimming.\u201d \n \n FROM PEN: Christie Brinkley\u2019s Girls Alexa and Sailor Reveal How They\u2019ve Conquered Bullies and Body Shamers \n \n Allegedly, an anonymous mall guest reported Pewee to mall security for \u201cinappropriate dress,\u201d and she was promptly kicked out of the shopping center. \n \n \u201cAs many of you know, it is NINETY degrees outside today in West Michigan. Aka, really hot. So, of course, I decided to dress for the weather: shorts and a tank top. But apparently, how I was dressed was too slutty for the public, as I was kicked out of the Woodland Mall today,\u201d Pewee captioned a photo of her outfit on Facebook, which has since gone viral with more than 10,000 likes and 7,000 shares. \n \n RELATED PHOTOS: UPDATED!

Three French workers find a secret booty worth almost one million euros whilst working on a house in Normandy. For them it was \"finders keepers\". But then the law caught up with them. \n \n Three French workers are to appear before a court on charges of theft after they stole a treasure trove of gold bars and coins from a house they were working on, a local newspaper reported on Monday. \n \n The men had been working on a house in Normandy for several days when they discovered the loot, estimated to be worth more than \u20ac900,000 ($1.2 million), hidden in jars. \n \n According to the report in regional daily Paris Normandie, the jars contained six gold bars weighing a kilogramme (2.2 lbs) each, and 600 gold $20 coins from 1924 and 1927. \n \n Rather than alert the owner of the house to their discovery, the workers, aged 20, 33 and 40, decided to steal the treasure and sell it to a coin collector in the area. \n \n But tax officials were alerted when one of the men began depositing high-value cheques. \n \n When investigators caught up with them, the men confessed to their crime, the newspaper said. \n \n Police seized several vehicles, motorcycles and hundreds of thousands of euros from the workers as part of the investigation. \n \n The three will appear at a court in Evreux, northwest of Paris, at an unspecified date. The coin collector will also appear before the court on charges of trying to conceal the theft, which he denies. \n \n Interviewed by Paris Normandie, the owner of the house where the gold was found recounted telling the workers jokingly: \"If you find any treasure, you tell me!\" ||||| Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The buried loot is estimated to be worth 900,000 euros (\u00a3720,000) \n \n Three French workers are to appear in court on charges of stealing gold worth 900,000 euros ($1.2m; \u00a3720,000) from a property they worked on, a local French newspaper reports. \n \n They are said to have been levelling land at a house in Normandy for several days when they discovered the 16 gold bars and 600 US $20-gold coins. \n \n The treasure, which was found in glass jars, may have been hidden on the property during World War Two. \n \n A coin collector has also been charged. \n \n Rather than alert the owners of the house to their discovery, the workers, aged 20, 33 and 40, decided to steal the gold and sell it to a local coin collector, it is alleged. \n \n But tax officials were alerted when one of the workers deposited two high-value cheques in his bank account. \n \n When investigators caught up with them, they confessed to their crime, according to the report in regional daily Paris Normandie (in French). \n \n The three are soon to appear at court in Evreux, north-west of Paris. \n \n The collector will also appear in court, charged with handling stolen goods, which he denies. \n \n Each gold bar weighs a kilogramme (2.2lb), while the 600 gold coins, dating from 1924 to 1927, weigh 33g (1.2oz) each, the newspaper said. \n \n According to local police, the three workers \"had fun\" with their new-found fortune, buying cars or motorcycles, but also investing in life insurance or in their homes. \n \n The house owners, who wish to remain anonymous, live in a small village in the Eure department in north-western France and had asked for their details and that of the crime, which happened some time ago, not to be revealed. \n \n \"You know, nobody knows about this story, even my children do not know... Since the police called me to tell me what happened, I have found it hard to sleep,\" the owner is quoted as saying by the newspaper. \n \n She is also reported as having told the workers jokingly as they started the work: \"If you find any treasure, be sure to tell me!\"",

    "document": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 If \"The story of Jack and Oskar\" was pitched as the script for a Hollywood movie, it's a good bet no one would believe it. \n \n In this Nov. 25, 1979 photo, Jack Yufe, left, and his twin brother, Oskar, look on. Separated soon after birth, Jack Yufe was raised as a Jew in Trinidad while his sibling Oskar grew up in Nazi Germany... (Associated Press) \n \n Separated sixth months after birth in 1933, Jack Yufe was raised as a Jew in his native Trinidad while his identical twin, Oskar Stohr, grew up in Nazi Germany, where he joined the Hitler Youth movement. \n \n When the two met again at a German train station at age 21 they discovered they didn't particularly like each other. Not so much because they were different, but because they were so much alike. \n \n Yufe, who died Monday of cancer in a San Diego hospital, had arrived for that first meeting wearing a white sports jacket, shirt and wire-rimmed glasses. So had his brother. \n \n \"I said, 'Oskar, you are wearing the same shirt and same glasses. Why?'\" Yufe, who was 82, recalled in a 1999 BBC documentary. \"He said to me, 'Why are you wearing the same thing that I am?'\" \n \n As they got to know each other better they would learn they also walked with the same gait, had the same nervous habits, even liked to play the same practical jokes on people. \n \n \"They both used to wash their hands before and after going to the toilet,\" recalled Nancy L. Segal, a professor of psychology at California State University, Fullerton, who studied the brothers as part of a landmark study of twins conducted at the University of Minnesota. \n \n \"They both used to like to sneeze loudly in elevators, thinking that was funny,\" she continued. \"If you sat across from them at a table and there was a vase with a rose or something, they would both shove it aside because they couldn't stand that.\" \n \n They also shared the same hot temper and competitive drive, which led them to learn not to ever talk politics or religion, Yufe's son, Kenneth, said Wednesday. \n \n \"It was an interesting pair to watch, for sure,\" he added. \n \n The two were separated when their parents split and their mother took Oskar to her native Germany while Jack stayed in Trinidad with their father. In his teens, Yufe moved to Israel where he served in the navy before moving to the United States and going into the retail business in San Diego. \n \n \"When he first started he was selling out of a van, and he'd see people who had no shoes or horrible shoes and he'd say, \"Here's a pair of boots, give me a dollar a week, that sort of thing,\" the son recalled. \"He'd give credit to people who never had credit before.\" \n \n But if the buyer didn't pay that dollar a week, his son recalled with a laugh, he'd demand those boots back. \n \n \"He was very old school, but he really was a wonderful guy.\" \n \n It was in San Diego that Yufe's first wife learned of the landmark Minnesota Twins Study and persuaded her husband and brother-in-law to take part. They and others showed remarkable similarities despite growing up apart from one another for decades. \n \n \"As psychologists, it made us really rethink our explanations for behavior,\" said Segal. \n \n Yufe and Stohr, meanwhile, came to care deeply for one another, said the psychologist, who got to know both over the 20-year study and wrote about them in her books \"Born Together \u2014 Reared Apart: The Landmark Minnesota Twin Study\" and \"Indivisible by Two: Lives of Extraordinary Twins.\" \n \n When Stohr died of cancer in 1997, she said, Yufe was devastated but couldn't bring himself to attend the funeral because he looked so much like his brother that he feared it would disturb the family. \n \n \"They had an amazing, what I would call a love-hate relationship,\" she said. \"They were fascinated by one another, fascinated by their similarities, intrigued that the worst traits that they saw in themselves were mirrored in the other one. They were hot tempered and short tempered and impatient, demanding. But their families loved them.\" \n \n In addition to his wife, Ruth, and son, Kenneth, Yufe is survived by daughters Anita Yufe, Hovi Reader and Debvra Gregory and stepsons Renee and Enrique Vega. ||||| Although the brothers got to know one another much better through the study and subsequent visits, their relationship never lost its prickly edge. Oskar had the same competitive nature, and the rivalry between them \"was just nonstop,\" Kenneth Yufe said Tuesday, recalling the time the two men even battled to see who had the best technique for cleaning a dirty car window. ||||| \n \n Separated soon after birth, Jack Yufe, left, was raised as a Jew in Trinidad while his sibling Oskar Stohr, right, grew up in Nazi Germany where he joined the Hitler Youth. (Robert Lachman/Los Angeles Times via AP) \n \n Jack Yufe grew up missing his other half, an identical twin brother from whom he had been separated at six months. \n \n For years, they exchanged letters and photographs. Then, at age 21, they met at a German train station. The encounter was detailed in psychologist Nancy Segal\u2019s book \u201cIndivisible by Two: Lives of Extraordinary Twins.\u201d \n \n Yufe and his brother, Oskar Stohr, examined one another as if they were looking at alien specimens, though no likeness could have been more familiar to either of them. Their cultural differences were as immediately apparent as their physical similarities. Casting a wary eye at Yufe\u2019s Israeli luggage tags, Stohr removed them and told his long-lost brother to tell others he was coming from America. \n \n From this first uneasy exchange in 1954 grew a complex but enduring bond that would bring Yufe and Stohr to the center of discussions about nature and nurture. After all, the differences between the brothers\u2019 upbringings were more extreme than those experienced by most twins separated by circumstance. \n \n Yufe grew up Jewish in Trinidad and became an officer in the Israeli Navy. Stohr grew up Catholic in Nazi Germany and became an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth. \n \n Yufe died Monday of cancer in a San Diego hospital, the Associated Press reports. He was 82. \n \n Stohr passed away in 1997, also of cancer. \n \n The brothers\u2019 unique relationship was a source of fascination for the researchers behind the landmark Minnesota twin study conducted from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. Seeking to identify how environmental and genetic factors contributed to psychological traits, the study closely examined the behaviors of sets of twins who were separated early in their lives and raised by different families. \n \n What made Yufe and Stohr an extraordinary case was not only the stark contrasts between the cultures in which they grew up \u2014 Nazism versus Judaism \u2014 but also the striking similarities in their habits and emotional temperaments. \n \n In 1933, Yufe and Stohr were born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, to a Romanian Jewish father and a German Catholic mother. According to Segal, it\u2019s not known whether the couple was ever married, and their relationship quickly soured \u201cas a result of [the father\u2019s] \u2018roving eyes\u2019 and excessive drinking.\u201d \n \n The twins\u2019 mother returned to her native Germany with Stohr and an older daughter in tow, while Yufe remained in Trinidad as a British subject. Meanwhile, Stohr became a subject of the German Reich and a member of the Hitler Youth, a cause he took on with enthusiasm. \n \n The Los Angeles Times reports that Stohr confessed years later to having dreamt of shooting his twin in an aerial dogfight. On the other hand, Yufe had a nightmare about killing his brother with a bayonet. \n \n Their stark cultural, political and religious differences were what initially made them the stars of headlines such as \u201cTwins: Nazi and Jew\u201d and snapshots that featured the Jewish star printed above one brother and a swastika above the other. \n \n \u201cBut that\u2019s too simple,\u201d Segal wrote of the pair. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it was.\u201d \n \n Once Yufe and Stohr started discovering their shared idiosyncrasies, those seemed even more peculiar than what set them apart. \n \n The first meeting \u2014 when Yufe visited Stohr, his mother and her side of the family in Germany \u2014 was awkward. Yufe recalled to Segal, \u201cWe saw each other as enemies, neither one of us would change. We looked at each other with suspicion.\u201d Then, on a boat trip they took together on the Rhine River, Jack had hoped to have some private time with Stohr, \u201cbut he was so unfriendly, and he was not trying to hide it. He kept covering his eyes with his hand.\u201d \n \n After six days, they parted ways with just a cold handshake. They wouldn\u2019t see each other for another 25 years. \n \n It was the Minnesota twin study that ultimately brought them back together. Yufe told the Los Angeles Times in 1979, \u201cI thought it perhaps would be a good idea\u2026to meet in a neutral territory to hash out all this, all the hidden feelings.\u201d \n \n The revelations began when they met at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. As it so happens, both were wearing the same outfit: a white sports jacket, shirt and wire-rimmed glasses. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018Oskar, you are wearing the same shirt and same glasses. Why?'\u201d Yufe recalled in a 1999 BBC documentary. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Why are you wearing the same thing that I am?'\u201d \n \n The similarities soon piled on, with startling specificity: both read books from back to front, sneezed loudly in elevators, wrapped rubber bands around their wrists, flushed toilets before and after using them and wore tight bathing suits. \n \n Segal explains in \u201cIndivisible by Two\u201d that some of these peculiar commonalities could be explained by genetics. The toilet-flushing, for instance, likely had to do with the brothers\u2019 sensitivity to germs. \n \n In later years, their wives noticed that they walked, and even tripped, in a similar fashion. \n \n Still, some differences persisted. They could never agree on Israel and Palestine, for instance, or who was responsible for World War II. Segal writes, \u201cOskar\u2019s repeated reference to German soldiers as \u2018we\u2019 infuriated Jack.\u201d \n \n After a stint in the Israeli army, Yufe eventually settled in San Diego and became the owner of a retail store called \u201cEl Progresso.\u201d Stohr stayed in Germany, working as a miner and electrical welder. \n \n \u201cThey had an amazing, what I would call a love-hate relationship,\u201d Yufe\u2019s wife, Ruth, told the AP. \u201cThey were fascinated by one another, fascinated by their similarities, intrigued that the worst traits that they saw in themselves were mirrored in the other one. They were hot-tempered and short-tempered and impatient, demanding. But their families loved them.\u201d \n \n Yufe\u2019s son, Kenneth, described his father to the AP as \u201cvery old school,\u201d but a \u201cwonderful guy.\u201d \n \n Yufe is also survived by daughters Anita Yufe, Hovi Reader and Debvra Gregory, as well as stepsons Renee and Enrique Vega. \n \n More from Morning Mix \n \n A course originally called \u2018The Problem of Whiteness\u2019 returns to Arizona State as racial tensions boil over on campuses \n \n Meet Sarah Parcak, a high-tech Indiana Jones, who just won $1 million for tracking down antiquities looters \n \n Dunkin\u2019 Donuts just \u2018destroyed\u2019 Starbucks with this much more Christmas-y holiday cup",

Yufe was born in Trinidad along with an identical twin brother, but their parents split after 6 months. Yufe grew up as a Jew, even serving a stint in the Israeli navy. Brother Oskar Stohr, meanwhile, went to Germany with his Catholic mom and grew up as a Nazi, becoming a member of the Hitler Youth. They managed to stay in touch and met again at age 21. The weird part? Despite their incredibly different backgrounds, they were alike in nearly every way. They dressed the same (both showed up to their first meeting in a white sports jacket and wire-rimmed glasses), walked the same, wore the same mustache, and had the same temperament and quirks. They both liked to sneeze loudly to scare people as a joke, and \"both used to wash their hands before and after going to the toilet,\" says Nancy Segal, a professor of psychology who studied the pair as part of a well-known study of separated twins at the University of Minnesota. The brothers' story eventually rose to \"the center of discussions about nature and nurture,\" notes the Washington Post. Though the brothers didn't much like each other at first, that changed over the years. When Stohr died of cancer in 1997, a devastated Yufe didn't attend the funeral, however, notes AP.

    "document": "Weight Watchers International Inc. reported a loss in the holiday quarter and said members continue to leave as the weight-loss company sheds more ground to apps and other gadgets that track calories. \n \n Chief Executive James Chambers said on Thursday that the company now expects its strategy to turn around the business\u2014which it started last year\u2014to take longer than expected because of a challenging start to 2015. As a result, the company disclosed plans to cut $100 million more in costs this year and forecast profit falling... ||||| Almost 60 million fitness trackers will be in use by 2018, tripling the number of the devices used this year, says a new research report from Juniper Research. \n \n The firm says fitness trackers like the Fitbit Charge and the Jawbone UP24 will triple to about 57 million in use in the wild worldwide by 2018, up from just 19 million this year. \n \n Juniper analysts expect fitness to remain the dominant segment in wearable devices until that time, pushed ahead by new fitness use cases, new biometrics measurements, and lower prices. \n \n But from now until 2018, the smartwatch category will be gaining steam and by 2018 will take over as the most-worn wearable device. This movement will begin in earnest with the launch of Apple\u2019s long awaited Watch, which is expected to show up on the market in the first half of 2015. Apple reportedly expects to sell 15 million of the devices in the first year. If this happens, smartwatch sales would overwhelm fitness tracker sales far sooner that 2018, as Juniper predicts. \n \n Juniper believes that there are basically two types of fitness trackers \u2014 less expensive ones like the $13 Xiaomi MiBand, which will compete mainly on price, and more complex devices, such as the Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, and Samsung Gear Fit, which will offer additional features beyond fitness, such as notifications and music control. \n \n Fitbit will remain the leading player for fitness tracking, Juniper says, although its decision not to integrate with Apple Health may harm its market share in the short term. \n \n More capable devices will compete with smart watches, especially those that offer similar notification functions, like the MetaWatch M1 and Martian Notifier, Juniper believes. \u201cHowever, more aesthetically minded consumers will still choose watches, as fitness-focused devices will prioritize function over form,\u201d Juniper notes in a report. ||||| Weight Watchers shares dropped the most since their market debut more than 13 years ago, after the dieting company\u2019s earnings forecast fell well short of analysts\u2019 expectations. \n \n The company has faced declining subscriptions and revenue as consumers migrate to digital methods for counting calories and keeping in shape. Weight Watchers International Inc. on Thursday reported that quarterly revenue had declined for the eighth straight period. \n \n The stock fell 35 percent to $11.33 on Friday in New York, the biggest drop since the company\u2019s initial public offering in November 2001. The shares had posted a 78 percent decline over the past three years through Thursday. \n \n Weight Watchers said Thursday that it would seek to cut $100 million in costs and that Lesya Lysyj, its president of North America operations, would leave the company. \n \n The company forecast earnings of 40 cents to 70 cents a share for this year, missing the $1.43 average of seven analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The costs associated with a plan to \u201cresize\u201d aren\u2019t reflected in the guidance, the company said. \n \n Weight Watchers has attempted to remake its image this year with a new ad campaign and redesigned magazine introduced in January. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to keep pace,\u201d said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. \u201cIts changes in marketing, product and technology haven\u2019t connected with consumers.\u201d \n \n \u2018Disappointed\u2019 \n \n Chief Executive Officer Jim Chambers said the company\u2019s turnaround would take longer than expected. \n \n \u201cI am disappointed that we are not yet where we hoped to be and our turnaround will take longer than anticipated,\u201d Chambers said Thursday on a conference call. \n \n Founded in 1961, Weight Watchers has built a system of dieting programs, food products and support centers for people seeking to slim down. \n \n Meanwhile, with consumers paying more attention to how many calories they are burning from exercise or everyday activities, fitness gadgets have surged in popularity, with 51.2 million American adults using applications to track their health, according to Nielsen. That is making it harder for Weight Watchers to justify subscriptions starting at $20 a month, since activity trackers can be paired with free mobile apps that make it easy to analyze caloric input and output. \n \n \u2018Get Modern\u2019 \n \n \u201cWeight Watchers really has to change what they\u2019re offering -- they have to get modern,\u201d said Meredith Adler, an analyst at Barclays. \u201cPeople are just more digital now than they ever were.\u201d \n \n New York-based Weight Watchers has embraced activity trackers. Subscribers can use FitBit, Jawbone and the company\u2019s own ActiveLink gadget to track diets and exercise. On the call, Chambers acknowledged that the company still had work to do to remake its image and offerings. \n \n \u201cI think you will see the Weight Watchers brand showing up differently going forward,\u201d he said. \n \n Weight Watchers\u2019 membership declined 15 percent in the past quarter, to 2.51 million active subscribers. While profit, excluding some charges, matched analysts\u2019 average estimate for 7 cents a share, revenue fell short of projections. Revenue declined 10 percent to $327.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared to an average analyst estimate of $334.3 million, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Last month, Weight Watchers was among the most-shorted stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. \n \n Threat Downplayed \n \n As CEO two years ago, David Kirchhoff said he didn\u2019t see wearable devices -- along with social media and other technologies -- as a threat. Instead, they presented a chance for the company to enhance its methods, counseling and business model, he said on an earnings conference call in February 2013. \n \n Three months later, on another call, Kirchhoff\u2019s tone began to change: \u201cIn this cash-strapped environment, the sudden proliferation in popularity of free alternative offerings has created a surge of trial in these apps. The resulting impact is contributing to a challenging recruitment environment, similar to what we saw back in 2000 with the low-carb diet fad.\u201d \n \n In November, the battle appeared all but lost. \n \n \u201cFrankly, we were slow to innovate and add value to our products,\u201d Weight Watchers Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Hotchkin said at an investor conference on Nov. 11. \u201cWe were particularly susceptible to the proliferation of free apps and activity monitors.\u201d \n \n Corporate Deals \n \n The company\u2019s best bet is to focus on providing weight-loss programs for corporations and health plans, which have been seeking ways to keep employees healthy and insurance costs low, according to Hottovy. This week, Weight Watchers announced a new partnership with health-care company Humana Inc. to offer diet programs at discounted rates on certain health insurance plans. \n \n \u201cThe largest growth opportunity for this company is partnering with corporations and health plans,\u201d Hottovy said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they\u2019ll really have a more comprehensive offering. That\u2019s something Weight Watchers can provide that calorie counting apps maybe can\u2019t.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The booming fitness-tracker trend is making it easier for people to track their activity and therefore lose weight, which is essentially what Weight Watchers has been trying to do since 1961. The company has encouraged subscribers to use devices like Fitbit and Jawbone\u2014and even has its own ActiveLink device. But while use of such devices soar (VentureBeat in November pointed to research that estimated 19 million trackers were in use in 2014, with that number slated to triple by 2018), Weight Watchers' membership keeps falling. It sank 15% in Q4 to a hair over 2.5 million subscribers, who pay a minimum of $20 for the service; Bloomberg points out that once a user invests in a tracker, the associated tracking apps are free. In early 2013, Weight Watchers didn't seem concerned by wearable devices. It acknowledged a challenge \"similar to what we saw back in 2000 with the low-carb diet fad\" a few months later. Now it's taking a hit: Revenue slid 10% to $327.8 million in the fourth quarter, and as of yesterday its share price had declined 78% over three years. It expects profit of 40 cents to 70 cents per share in 2015, while analysts had estimated profit of $1.43 per share, the Wall Street Journal reports. The company has announced a deal with Humana to bring discounted diet programs to certain health insurance plans, which an analyst suggests is the company's best option, but it will also undergo cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, to save $100 million.

Mexico will send more... (Associated Press) \n \n The new mission, \"Coordinated Operation Northeast,\" aims to reinforce government authority in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon _ the two states under the heaviest attack since the formerly allied Gulf and Zetas gangs split. \n \n The government also wants to keep the cartels from regrouping after the loss of key leaders, federal police spokesman Alejandro Poire said Wednesday. \n \n But Poire gave no details on the operation, saying only that there will be a \"significant\" increase in forces. He answered no questions at a media briefing with Mexico security officials and the two state governors, and the government later said it would not provide numbers for its forces now in the area or the level after the reinforcements because of security reasons. \n \n Intense cartel violence has gripped Nuevo Leon in and around the industrial, high-tech hub of Monterrey, once one of Mexico's safest large cities. Bloodshed also is high across all of Tamaulipas, which shares a 560-mile (900-kilometer) border with Texas and some of the busiest border crossings in the world opposite the U.S cities of Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville. \n \n \"These are geographic factors that have made the area a coveted route for organized crime in the trafficking of drugs and people and in receiving illegal money and arms coming into Mexico,\" Poire said. \n \n Since the falling out between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas, its former arm of assassins, Nuevo Leon has seen regular gang roadblocks on city streets, assassinations of local politicians and shootouts and grenade attacks that have killed innocent civilians. \n \n In Tamaulipas, where mayors and a gubernatorial candidate have also been killed, gang violence has closed schools, made roads unsafe for travel and blocked some government oil workers from reaching installations. \n \n Earlier this month, residents fleeing gunbattles in the state's once-picturesque town of Ciudad Mier ended up in Mexico's first drug-war refugee shelter. In another part of Tamaulipas, 72 migrants trying to reach the United States were found slaughtered earlier in the year. \n \n Residents have accused the federal and state government of being conspicuously absent, leaving them in the crossfire of military-strength weaponry wielded by drug gunmen. \n \n Local media has been intimidated or co-opted out of covering the drug war, leaving Tamaulipas cities such as Reynosa to warn residents during outbreaks of violence via Twitter and Facebook. \n \n Poire said government forces are present and touted recent military and police blows against the two cartels: the killing earlier this month of Gulf cartel leader Antonio \"Tony Tormenta\" Cardenas Guillen, the 2008 capture of a founding member of the Zetas, Jaime \"The Hummer\" Gonzalez Duran, and the arrest of eight presumed Zeta members in the killing of the migrants. \n \n Katherine Cesinger, spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, praised the buildup. \n \n \"We are encouraged by these reports that Mexico is increasing the patrol presence along their border in an effort to shutdown the ruthless drug cartels,\" she said. \"We share the common goal of keeping our communities safe.\" \n \n The Mexican government has similar operations in other parts of country, including Chihuahua state, where the border city of Ciudad Juarez across from El Paso, Texas, is considered one of the most violent cities in the world. Such efforts so far have failed to quell drug violence, which has killed 28,000 people since President Felipe Calderon launched his offensive on organized crime in late 2006. \n \n An opinion poll released this week said 49 percent of Mexicans believe the government's drug war has been a failure, compared to 33 percent who said it has been a success. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Terry Wallace contributed to this report from Dallas, Texas. ||||| Reporting from Mexico City \u2014 Mexican authorities Wednesday announced they had arrested the new leader of the drug gang formerly run by suspected kingpin Edgar \"La Barbie\" Valdez Villarreal. \n \n The arrest late Tuesday of Carlos Montemayor marked a fresh blow against the remnants of the once-formidable Beltran Leyva gang, battered by arrests, deaths and vicious internal fighting. \n \n Mexican federal police said Montemayor took over the faction once led by Valdez, a U.S. citizen arrested in August. The in-fighting has stoked months of killings and beheadings across the states of Morelos and Guerrero, home to the resort city of Acapulco. \n \n Ramon Eduardo Pequeno, head of the anti-drug division of the federal police, told reporters that Montemayor had said that 20 Mexican men who disappeared in Acapulco in late September were seized and killed in a case of mistaken identity.",

Then, she seamlessly segued into an tribute to the Florence Foster Jenkins star's talent. But, the most moving part of the speech was listening to Davis talk about how much Streep meant to her as both a person and actress. \"You make me proud to be an artist. You make me feel that what I have in me \u2014 my body, my face, my age \u2014 is enough.

(Many of both types featured the Globes' new host, Jimmy Fallon.) Here are the moments that should be inspiring the most extended buzzes and brutal hangovers tomorrow morning. \n \n BEST MOMENTS \n \n Billy Bob Thorton vs. Bob Odenkirk \n \n Never lacking for misanthropic style, Billy Bob Thorton used his surprise win for Best Actor in a Comedy Series as an opportunity to settle a puzzling fictional score with vanquished co-nominee Bob Odenkirk: \"Bob and I have had a feud since the 1940s when we did a movie with Van Johnson -- remember that, Bob? And we've had a little thing ever since. So, there you go, bud.\" Made as much sense as Billy Bob's indoor sunglasses, and was just as amusing. \n \n Donald Glover's Migos Shout-Out \n \n \"Not for being in the show, but for making 'Bad and Boujee.' That\u2019s the best song\u2026ever.\u201d How quickly we forget about \"Black Beatles\" -- but still, close enough. \n \n Denzel Washington, Having a Moment \n \n And we hadn't even gotten to Meryl Streep's speech yet. \n \n ?ulia Louis-Dreyfuss \n \n Not a bad look with the hair pick and glasses, but most memorable was just JLD's presented-without-comment DJ impression -- a faux-scratch here, a knob twiddle there, and a perpetually undistractable facial expression. \n \n \"Fantasia Day\" \n \n Without Tina and Amy, nothing more reliable at the Golden Globes than Kristen Wiig and a worthy comedic partner shaming all other pre-award banter with a routine that's confusing, unpredictable and at least mostly hilarious. Her and Steve Carrell did the legacy proud this year with their tragic remembrances of the first time they ever saw an animated movie; Wiig while her three dogs were being put down, and Carrell just before his parents got divorced: \"I never saw my father again after that day\u2026 Fantasia day\u2026\u201d \n \n Barb in the opening musical number \n \n But only if we all agree that this is the last time, and we're all gonna let it go after this. \n \n Brian Tyree Henry and Keith Stanfield, beaming \n \n Tough for Donald Glover to top his Migos moment, but although his speech for Best Actor in a Comedy was damn strong, the emotional heavy lifting was done in the crowd, where Glover's two Atlanta co-stars were shown clutching each other like a couple of tearfully proud parents. A moment of true poignance, even more so because now we can look forward to the possibility of it somehow being integrated into an upcoming season two episode. \n \n Meryl's speech \n \n Meryl Streep's anti-Trump speech at The Golden Globes touches on protecting journalists RT @goldenglobes: pic.twitter.com/FTubRjDN5T \u2014 Dan Rather (@DanRather) January 9, 2017 \n \n Raw, heartfelt, necessary and earned -- and for us in the press, more ennobling than we sometimes deserve. \n \n WORST MOMENTS \n \n Take that, Mariah Carey \n \n Jimmy Fallon experienced a monitor mishap of his own to begin the live portion of his Golden Globes hosting, so he deflected any potential virality to a predecessor who'll forever have him trumped, Mariah Carey: \"She thinks that Dick Clark Productions sabotaged my monologue.\" Took him until the next time he was out to come up with that zinger, too. \n \n \"Hidden Fences,\" not once but twice \n \n To be fair, Hidden Fences does sound like a pretty good movie title. But, uh, still not a particularly good look for Michael Keaton, Jenna Bush, or anyone. \n \n Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn's forgotten-glasses schtick \n \n Is the best we can do for this duo a series of never-funny jokes about misreading the teleprompter? Between this and the \"Formation\" video remake, it's like Amy and Goldie think they have to try way harder than they actually do to be funny and awesome together. \n \n The doubly aggressive play-off music \n \n Questlove def feels bad about pumping in the play 'em off music like producers are in his ear like \"BLAST IT\" and he's like \"guys be nice!\" \u2014 Jeff McDev (@JeffMcDev) January 9, 2017 \n \n Yeah, we all want to get out of here and go to sleep, but this is just getting insulting. ||||| Presenting the Golden Globe for best animated film brought up some painful memories for Kristen Wiig and Steve Carell. \n \n The hilarious duo \u2014and Despicable Me voice actors \u2014 had the audience in stitches from the get-go, with Carell greeting the audience, \u201cGood evening peers and regular people.\u201d \n \n Get push notifications with news, features and more. \n \n Wiig then made a quip about her new short hairdo, saying that in addition to collaborating with Carell for the animated series, the two \u201calso get our haircut together.\u201d \n \n Watch PEOPLE & EW Red Carpet Live Sunday night and streaming now on People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to PEOPLE.com/PEN, or download the app for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Xumo, Chromecast, Xfinity, iOS and Android devices. \n \n But the pair really found their groove when Wiig asked Carell if he could remember the first animated movie he ever saw. \n \n \u201cI do actually, very well. Kind of a big deal, I was 6 years old and my dad took me to see Fantasia,\u201d he began. \n \n \u201cIt was astounding. The music, the spectacle of the whole thing. It was kind of a life-changing experience,\u201d he continued. \n \n \u201cAnd as we were leaving the theater, there standing in the lobby was my mom \u2014 and that was the moment that she told my dad that she wanted a divorce,\u201d he said, wiping an imaginary tear from his eye. \n \n Want to win a trip to L.A.? Enter now for your chance to be at the Oscars\u00ae Red Carpet \n \n \u201cI never saw my father again after that day. Fantasia day,\u201d he added, feigning heartbreak. \n \n Changing the subject, Carell then asked Wiig about the first animated movie she saw as a kid. \n \n \u201cBambi,\u201d Wiig answered. \u201cMarch 14, 1981: It was the same day we had to put our dogs down,\u201d she said, staring off sadly into the distance. \n \n Check out PEOPLE\u2019s full 2017 Golden Globe Awards coverage and complete winners list! \n \n \u201cMy grandpa thought it\u2019d be fun to go to the movie and take our minds off of it,\u201d Wiig added, breaking character with a smile for the first time. \u201cAlso, that was the last day I saw my grandpa,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t speak for two years.\u201d \n \n After the nominees for the award appeared onscreen, Carell and Wiig were seen hugging it out onstage. \n \n And for the record, Zootopia took home the Golden Globe. ||||| Well, another Golden Globes have come and gone. We\u2019re a little older and a little wiser and we probably have a better idea of who\u2019s going to win the Oscars. And we have a few Jimmy Fallon jokes to quote in the morning. Here are some of his best moments from the show: \n \n Fallon\u2019s buzzed-about, pre-recorded opening number included a guest-rapped verse from Millie Bobby Brown and a Justin Timberlake-backed dance routine, but he held something back for the monologue, peppering his cold open with lines establishing the Globes as \u201cone of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote.\u201d \n \n A brief teleprompter mishap gave Fallon room to riff on Mariah Carey\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve woes \u2026 \n \n Fallon also worked in a Sting impression before bringing in the singer to present a Globe, to the consternation of some on Twitter \u2026 \n \n Only took a half hour for @jimmyfallon to bust out a Sting impression, sending Vegas odd makers into a tizzy for missing the over/under \u2014 Glazer (@GlazedTweets) January 9, 2017 \n \n Fallon\u2019s Sting impression was hardly the most verbally dextrous moment his hosting stint: That would go to his introduction of Michael Keaton, which went a little something like this \u2026 \n \n Also, if you were able to keep a dry eye during Fallon\u2019s heartfelt tribute to Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, you were definitely in the minority. \n \n \u201cHollywood has been around for over a hundred years. Five generations built this industry. It\u2019s a big industry and sometimes we forget that it\u2019s actually a community, a community of families. This past year we lost so many legends and icons but a few weeks ago we lost a mother and a daughter within just a couple of days. It was a terrible loss that we all felt so tonight we\u2019d like to pay tribute to Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.\u201d \n \n Oh, and then he turned Eddie Redmayne and Jessica Chastain\u2019s presenting stint into a riff on a riff on Cypress Hill\u2019s \u201cInsane in the Brain.\u201d \n \n So those of you waiting at home to see if Fallon would pay tribute to an early-\u201990s hip-hop group \u2026 you can collect your winnings tomorrow in the office.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There was no shortage of memorable moments at the 74th annual Golden Globes, from Ryan Gosling thanking his partner, Eva Mendes, for handling their family life at home while he was filming his movie La La Land, to Meryl Streep revealing how one recent moment (a moment related to President-elect Donald Trump) \"kind of broke my heart.\" Some other notable quotes and happenings at the Globes: Streep wasn't the only one to call attention to No. 45. Hugh Laurie also jumped on the anti-Trump allusion train, hinting that this may be the last Golden Globes show because of the new administration's distrust of celebrities and noting he was accepting his best supporting actor award for The Night Manager \"on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere,\" the Hill reports. Fallon himself noted, per Mediaite, that \"many people [had been] wondering what it would be like if King Joffrey [from Game of Thrones] had lived. Well, in 12 days we're gonna find out.\" He also announced the night's votes had been tabulated by the \"accounting firm of Ernst, Young, and Putin\" and told the crowd that the Globes are \"one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,\" People reports. The night's host couldn't resist a callback to the show's opening teleprompter issues, incorporating the ongoing Mariah Carey New Year's Eve saga to make his point. \"I just got off the phone with Mariah Carey and she thinks that Dick Clark Productions sabotaged my monologue,\" he said, per Us Weekly. The New York Daily News recaps some of Fallon's other zingers. Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn appeared as the \"Golden Globes comedy duo we never knew we needed,\" per E!

Hawn turned on the loopiness while Schumer played the straight one, with Goldie using the word \"mystical\" instead of \"musical\" and announcing the \"nominees of the five most tainted men\" instead of the five most \"talented\" ones. \"Kurt, do you have her glasses?\" Schumer asked Hawn's partner, Kurt Russell, who was sitting in the audience. Two other comedians also made an impact at the awards show, but their turn was more of the \"hilariously dark\" version, per People. Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig presented the award for best animated feature, but not before they revealed the first animated movies they had seen as kids. \"As we were leaving the theater, there standing in the lobby was my mom\u2014and that was the moment that she told my dad that she wanted a divorce,\" Carell said of his (supposed) Fantasia experience. \"March 14, 1981: It was the same day we had to put our dogs down,\" Wiig recalled of her first alleged viewing of Bambi. Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, and Today.com offer their own takes on the best and worst moments of the show. (There was also a pretty hot kiss between Ryan Reynolds and Andrew Garfield.)",

Brooks is a British citizen and can be compelled to appear, wrote the Telegraph. \n \n After first declaring the Murdochs and Brooks would appear, the committee\u2019s chairman, John Whittingdale, told the BBC that there is \u201csome confusion reigning\u201d about if they will show. News Corp. said it awaits an official request. \n \n The Murdochs and Brooks have been asked to appear before the committee July 19. ||||| LONDON \u2014 Shortly after Scotland Yard began its initial criminal inquiry of phone hacking by The News of the World in 2006, five senior police investigators discovered that their own cellphone messages had been targeted by the tabloid and had most likely been listened to. \n \n The disclosure, based on interviews with current and former officials, raises the question of whether senior investigators feared that if they aggressively investigated, The News of the World would punish them with splashy articles about their private lives. Some of their secrets, tabloid-ready, eventually emerged in other news outlets. \n \n Those damaging allegations, about two of the senior officers\u2019 private lives, involved charges that one had padded his expense reports and was involved in extramarital affairs and that the other used frequent flier miles accrued on the job for personal vacations. \n \n \u201cIf it is true that police officers knew their phones had been hacked, it is a serious matter that requires immediate investigation,\u201d said John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which investigated phone hacking. \u201cIt would be shocking.\u201d \n \n The lead police investigator on the phone-hacking case, Andy Hayman, left the Metropolitan Police in December 2007 after questions were raised in the news media about business expenses he had filed and the nature of his relationship with a woman who worked for the Independent Police Complaints Commission. \n \n At the time, Channel 4 News reported details of 400 text messages and phone calls that Mr. Hayman had sent to her. \n \n John Yates, the assistant commissioner who has become a lightning rod for the police\u2019s handling of the phone-hacking case, had reportedly used frequent flier miles earned in the line of duty to pay for flights for his relatives. \n \n The outlets that reported these allegations have not been implicated in the hacking. \n \n Members of Parliament will question Mr. Hayman, Mr. Yates and several other senior police officials at a hearing on Tuesday of the Home Affairs Select Committee to try to determine why the Metropolitan Police decided to strictly limit the initial phone-hacking inquiry in 2006. \n \n One area of inquiry is whether the fact that the officials\u2019 phones had been hacked had any impact on the scope of their initial investigation, according to two members of the committee. They are also concerned about whether the investigators had a conflict of interest because they themselves were victims of the people they were investigating. \n \n Among the 11,000 pages of documents seized from the home of The News of the World\u2019s phone-hacking specialist, Glenn Mulcaire, in August 2007, the investigators also found the names of Sir Ian Blair, then the Metropolitan Police commissioner, and at least two other senior police officials involved in the inquiry, according to several former senior Scotland Yard officials. The officials declined to reveal the names of the other investigators. \n \n Sir Ian declined to comment on Monday. \n \n In the autumn of 2006, the police notified only a handful of victims that their cellphone messages had been hacked, even though there was evidence that News of the World journalists might have gained access to the messages of nearly 4,000 people. The top police officials learned they had been hacked after an 8-to-10-page list of potential victims was assembled that fall for Mr. Hayman, several former Scotland Yard officials said. \n \n In January 2007, Mr. Mulcaire and Clive Goodman, the paper\u2019s royalty reporter, pleaded guilty to gaining access to the messages of aides to the royal family and were sentenced to prison. The inquiry was then concluded. For years after that, Scotland Yard officials, including Mr. Yates, insisted that there was no evidence of further hacking, a claim he repeated in 2009. \n \n A Scotland Yard spokesman declined to discuss whether any senior officials\u2019 phones had been hacked. \u201cWe will not comment on media speculation or give a running commentary on our investigation,\u201d the spokesman said. \n \n In an interview published by The Telegraph on Sunday, Mr. Yates apologized for the initial Scotland Yard inquiry, acknowledging that it was lax and ineffectual. \u201cI have regrettably said the initial inquiry was a success,\u201d Mr. Yates said. \u201cClearly now that looks very different.\u201d \n \n In Parliament on Monday, two Labour Party lawmakers, Chris Bryant and Tom Watson, accused Mr. Yates of lying and renewed calls for his resignation.",

Five senior police investigators discovered their voicemail had likely been hacked in 2006, soon after Scotland Yard began its initial investigation into the matter, the New York Times reports. And the revelation raises some sticky questions, like: Could this have caused investigators to ease up on the tabloid out of fear their private lives would be exposed? Members of Parliament will question several police officials today to determine whether the hacking impacted the police inquiry, which was initially very limited, and whether those hacked experienced a conflict of interest. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown today accused Murdoch's media empire, specifically the Sunday Times, of hiring \"known criminals\" to gather personal details about his bank account, legal files, and taxes, the New York Times reports. Brown also believes the paper somehow got access to his son's medical records and passed it along to the Sun, a source says. Meanwhile, more reports are emerging that police officers were bribed for information on Brown, the royal family, and others, and that money was spent to secure a copy of the Green Book, which details the queen and Prince Charles' activities.

Walmart says it is \"looking into the impact that this proposal will be on our business,\" but it remains \"neutral\" on the issue, according to a spokeswoman. \u2013 Two of the nation's biggest employers are raising wages after President Obama's executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour. Gap, which owns Old Navy, Banana Republic, Gap, Athleta, and Piperlime, says it will raise wages for about 65,000 employees to $9 in June and to $10 in June 2015, reports NBC News. Gap says \"the majority\" of employees in stores, call centers, and distribution centers currently earn more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. \"To us, this is not a political issue,\" says Gap Chairman and CEO Glenn Murphy. \"Our decision to invest in frontline employees will directly support our business, and is one that we expect to deliver a return many times over.\" Meanwhile, Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, said today it is \"looking at supporting\" a minimum wage increase, reports Reuters.",
