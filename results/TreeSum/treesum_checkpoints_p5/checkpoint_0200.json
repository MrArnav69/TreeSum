She's Also the Most Fun \n \n PEOPLE's 2015 World's Most Beautiful Woman, Sandra Bullock, opens up in her most revealing interview ever. Subscribe now for instant access to this exclusive interview , plus almost 200 more breathtaking beauties, only in PEOPLE!She may be PEOPLE's 2015 World's Most Beautiful Woman, but Sandra Bullock doesn't take herself too seriously when it comes to her appearance.Despite being in \"princess mode\" while shooting for this year's cover story, Bullock, 50, insists she just laughed when she heard about the honor. \"No, really. I just said, 'That's ridiculous,' \" she tells PEOPLE. \"I've told no one.\"Instead the Oscar winner, who voices a supervillain in the upcoming movie Minions, has found beauty in her role as mom to her 5-year-old son, Louis, adding that their life together is a constant reminder of what's important.\"Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' \" she explains. \"No, be a good person, be a good mom, do a good job with the lunch, let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying.\"Daily life for the two revolves around carpools, play dates and \"deep\" conversations, including a recent one involving Bullock \"listening to him tell me why he was going to marry his girlfriend,\" she says. \"But then we were having Sunday dinner, and he said he changed his mind. I just told him, 'Always love those who want to love you back and are nice to you.' Then we moved back to Legos and 'Why are you making me eat broccoli?' \"As a mom, Bullock admits she is wrapped around her son's finger, \"but I will never let him know it. We have rules,\" she says. \"I let everyone else be the aunties and uncles who spoil him and I'm the one that lays down the law.\"The actress reveals that Louis can always make her laugh by dancing (\"it's like a combination of break dancing and kung fu fighting with an occasional Downward Dog thrown in for good measure\") and still doesn't know what his mom does for a living. \"He thought I was an astronaut for a while,\" she adds. \"I want it to be so inconsequential and such a nonissue. I want him to be embarrassed by me like all other parents.\"Aside from motherhood, Bullock credits a healthy diet \u2013 she's moved away from raw cookie dough and embraced green juice \u2013 and working out with Body by Simone four to five times a week for helping her stay balanced and grounded.\"I love that it's not big weights, you move the entire time, it's a torture chamber of sorts,\" she says. \"When I started, I could barely do 20 seconds, and I'm not kidding. I'm crying on the floor, and she's like, 'Are you a smoker?' I was like, 'I hate you.' \"The best compliments she hears these days are usually spoken by her little man. \"I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in,\" she says. \"And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' \"For more of Bullock's exclusive interview \u2013 in which she opens up about family and her life as a mom \u2013 pick up this week's special issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday",

(\u00a9 Mario Anzuoni / Reuters/REUTERS) \n \n Nutritionists at Brown & Medina in Manhattan also questioned FATwater\u2019s claims, saying in a statement that the small amount of fat diluted in the water \u201cwould most likely not have an impact on fat burn.\u201d \n \n There is \u201cno research on the fat being more hydrating,\u201d the statement continued. \n \n The country\u2019s sole water sommelier, Martin Riese, who offers 20 mineral and spring waters at Ray\u2019s & Stark Bar in Los Angeles, was aware of FATwater \u2014 and doesn\u2019t think much of it. \n \n \u201cWater should not have any calories and this has 20,\u201d he says. \u201cThis, I say, is a \u2018near water product.\u2019 I believe water should come from nature and not a factory.\u201d \n \n Though Asprey is not the first to extract the oil, he is the first to mix it in water, patent and market it. \n \n Research, smesearch, Asprey suggests. \n \n He cites his creation of Bulletproof Coffee as evidence that conventional wisdom is wrong and that everything \u2014 even nature itself \u2014 can be improved upon. \n \n \u201cBiohacking is taking control of the environment around you so you have control of your biology,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you are less stressed and recover better and are a nicer person.

But one took a deep sip, swallowed, and gave FATwater its highest praise: \u201cYou know what? It\u2019s not that bad.\u201d ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health \n \n This is This Is Now a Thing, where we check out the science behind new health trends. \n \n Courtesy of FATwater \n \n The thing: A $3.95 bottle of water mixed with fat, a sweetener and some flavors. The new 20-calorie beverage, called FATwater, was developed by entrepreneur Dave Asprey, creator of the Bulletproof Coffee craze that still has people adding large amounts of butter and oil to their coffee in the hopes of losing weight. FATwater isn\u2019t a weight-loss drink, per se (each bottle contains 2 grams of fat). Rather, the company bills its product as an alternative to sugary coconut waters and energy drinks. \n \n Asprey says he uses a patented process to take purified water and mix in tiny droplets of \u201cBulletproof XCT Oil\u201d: medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) derived from coconut oil. \u201cThe water looks kind of iridescent, pearlescent,\u201d Asprey tells TIME. \u201cIt has these tiny, invisible droplets of fat that your body really, really likes.\u201d FATwater can be bought bottled or in a concentrated gel that you mix with water yourself. \n \n MORE: Bamboo Water Is Now a Thing \n \n The hype: Asprey says FATwater is more hydrating than plain water because the nanoparticles of fat \u201cbring the water into the cells more effectively.\u201d He adds: \u201cDrink a glass of water, and some of it will absorb and some of it won\u2019t. But when your body sees that fat, it says, \u2018Oh, come on in, this is pure energy.\u2019 It brings the water in with the fat.\u201d \n \n Plus, he says, \u201cyou get a little bump of energy.\u201d \n \n The bottle says this: \u201cXCTs follow a special metabolic pathway to burn fat instead of storing it,\u201d the label reads, while giving your body \u201cthe clean, high quality fuel it needs\u2014and nothing else.\u201d The bottle also includes this disclaimer, which is required by federal law: \u201cThese statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d \n \n The research: It is true that medium chain triglycerides are digested differently than other fats, says Marie-Pierre St-Onge, PhD, assistant professor in the department of medicine at Columbia University\u2019s Institute of Human Nutrition and a researcher of MCTs. Instead of being stored into fatty tissue to be used for energy later, they\u2019re typically just burned off. \n \n But does that mean they give you energy? \u201cIt\u2019s actually the opposite,\u201d St-Onge says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the energy\u2014you\u2019re not storing it\u2014so you\u2019re burning it. It\u2019s not useful energy.\u201d \n \n Where MCTs are useful, St-Onge says, is when you use them to replace another fat (cooking with a little coconut oil, for instance, instead of butter or olive oil). In one study by St-Onge lasting 16 weeks, people who consumed 18-24 daily grams of medium chain triglycerides lost more weight than people who ate the same amount of olive oil. \n \n \u201cThe type of fat that\u2019s used in FATwater increases overall thermogenesis, which is fat-burning in the body,\u201d Asprey says. But St-Onge, who\u2019s own research has shown that MCT oil does enhance diet-induced thermogenesis compared to longer-chain fats, is skeptical that 2 grams of MCT oil\u2014the amount found in FATwater\u2014would have any impact on fat burn. She used a minimum of 18 grams all the way up to 60 grams in her research. \n \n And what about the notion that MCTs shuttle water more effectively into the body than water ever could alone? \n \n We asked David Julian McClements, professor in the department of food science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who says he makes his own fat-infused emulsions all the time for research. Adding drops of oil to water infused with supplements like beta carotene, he\u2019s found, helps your body make use of those nutrients. But improved hydration is not one of the established benefits of MCT emulsions like these, McClements says. \n \n When asked about it, Asprey says he\u2019s aware of the lack of research. \u201cWe\u2019re working on specific studies for these exact formulations,\u201d he says. \n \n The taste: When TIME\u2019s health team tried the berry and lemon flavors of FATwater, which are sweetened with xylitol, no one could agree on what it tasted like. One reporter thought it tasted \u201clike lotion\u201d; another thought it tasted like the sweet innards of liquid-filled chewing gum; and another said it tasted like \u201csweetened room water\u201d\u2014a glass of water that\u2019s been sitting out and collects dust or other particulates from the air. \n \n Though you\u2019re not supposed to be able to detect the fat, one writer said: \u201cI feel like something\u2019s coating my tongue in a not-pleasant way.\u201d \n \n The bottom line: Water hydrates the body just fine on its own, St-Onge says. \u201cIf you\u2019re thirsty, drink water,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, eat food.\u201d \n \n Read Next: Charcoal Juice Is Now A Thing",

It's called FATwater, and creator Dave Asprey swears it's better than real water because it is infused with tiny droplets of fat extracted from coconut oil (he's patented this) that improve both hydration and fat burning. The cloud computing pioneer calls it \"biohacking,\" or \"taking control of the environment around you so you have control of your biology,\" he says. \"You are less stressed and recover better and are a nicer person.

Asprey himself concedes that there isn't much research in this area, but he says he's got plenty of anecdotal evidence that because MCTs are digested differently than other fats, you do \"get a little bump of energy.\" But St-Onge says he's actually got it backward because they're just burned off. \"It's not useful energy.\" She adds that the 2 grams of fat in a bottle isn't close to enough to improve fat-burning. Meanwhile taste testers at both the Daily News and Time were unimpressed, describing the water as tasting like \"lotion,\" \"sweetened room water\" that's gotten dusty from sitting around, and \"liquid soap.\" FATwater is currently being sold in Santa Monica and Los Angeles.

But hours later she posted again, describing an encounter with armed men. \u201cTurned corner and found 50 guys in motor boats with arrows!!! My face must have been a picture!! (Town was uber quiet ... too quiet!!) all go ... \n \n \u201cOK 30 guys ... but either way ... that\u2019s a lot of folks in one area in boats with arrow[s] and rifles.\u201d \n \n Three people held in Brazil on suspicion of British kayaker's murder Read more \n \n The following day, as she neared Coari, on the banks of the Solim\u00f5es river, an Amazon tributary, Kelty triggered a distress signal. She has been missing ever since. On Tuesday, police said they had arrested three males on suspicion of her murder. \n \n Kelty, 43, from Finchley in north-west London, resigned as head of Knollmead primary school in Surbiton in 2014 to go travelling. No stranger to solo adventures, she had been only the sixth woman to ski solo to the south pole and hiked 2,600 miles alone across the US. \n \n She had begun kayaking in February after deciding that her next challenge would be to paddle the Amazon from its source in the Peruvian Andes to the Atlantic Ocean. \n \n There had already been unsettling moments in her trip, particularly since crossing the border into Brazil\u2019s Amazonas state. On 22 August she told followers how she had paddled hard upstream to reach a beach to rest, \u201conly to find a man waving a machete and ravens eating whatever he had killed. As I paddled hard away ... I could hear his shouts.\u201d \n \n \n \n In the following days she complained of broken sleep, interrupted by strangers. \u201cGetting more tired every day,\u201d she wrote on 23 August. \u201cLet\u2019s hope I don\u2019t get [four] more guys \u2018returning to visit me after dark\u2019 tonight.\u201d \n \n Three days later, after a \u201cgreat welcome\u201d and day and night in S\u00e3o Paulo de Oliven\u00e7a, she reported that two men pitched up in a boat close to where she had stopped and just stayed there for two hours, stopping her from changing. \u201cAnd yes, I did try to engage ... but they were the silent type.\u201d \n \n On 28 August she said she was \u201cofficially beyond triedness [sic]\u201d. \u201cEvery night there has been a torch bearer and walker who comes to my tent,\u201d she wrote. When strangers left her alone, Kelty fought \u201ctent-bending\u201d storms and 85% humidity. Yet there were also moments of tranquility. \n \n \u201cThe last couple of days paddling was just what I imagined it to be,\u201d she recounted on 5 September. \u201cNow, I am sitting on my private beach in the sun. So quiet and just perfect.\u201d \n \n Emma Tamsin Kelty (@Emt101s) Enjoying a moments peace ... all is calm and just enjoying just being. #peru #so2017 #sourcetosea #riverlife #amaz\u2026 https://t.co/QFu0QAZkoq pic.twitter.com/Ak6CMLAFmO \n \n Kelty is believed to have pitched her tent on Boieiro island, facing the town of Lauro Sodr\u00e9, before she set off her locator flare last Wednesday. A 17-year-old suspect arrested on Monday in Codaj\u00e1s said that was where she was approached by two people. Five others arrived and the group stole her belongings. She was shot twice with a sawn-off shotgun and dumped in the river. \n \n According to the teenager, whom police did not name for legal reasons, the group tried to sell her two mobile phones, her tablet computer and her GoPro camera in local communities. Another 17-year-old from Lauro Sodr\u00e9 was also arrested, as well as a third man, named as Erinei Ferreira da Silva, whose age was not given. Police are looking for four further suspects. \n \n After Kelty\u2019s distress call, authorities had launched a search operation involving 60 people, including divers scouring the riverbed. Residents of Lauro Sodr\u00e9 reported having seen Kelty alive, sailing past in her canoe. Fire officers and the Brazilian navy are continuing to look for her body and have searched the area where it was allegedly thrown. \n \n Rocky Contos, a guide Kelty employed in Peru for the first six weeks of her trip, said he tried to warn her of the dangers she faced, but that she was determined to continue alone. \u201cI told her there are people there who have no regard for life,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Times. \u201cThere are many cases of people being robbed and shot.\u201d \n \n River pirates are known to operate in the area where Kelty went missing. Local media reported two men were arrested in July after carrying out pirate attacks around Lauro Sodr\u00e9 and nearby communities. \n \n \u201cThis region is a problematic region for pirates,\u201d Barradas J\u00fanior said. \u201cIt is a region that has pirates, they do robberies, and it is a disputed region because there are a lot of drugs coming from Colombia.\u201d He said pirates had been known to attack Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers, steal their supplies and throw their bodies in the river. \n \n A struggle between rival Brazilian drug gangs to control the lucrative drug trade flowing down the Solim\u00f5es river was blamed for a massacre in which 56 people were murdered in a prison in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, on New Year\u2019s Day. Dozens more were killed in reprisal attacks. \n \n The remote stretch of the Solim\u00f5es where Kelty is thought to have gone missing is the same section where the state\u2019s previous civil police chief, Thyago Garcez, disappeared in December last year, after he and other police officers got into a firefight with drugs traffickers. His body has never been found. \n \n The Foreign Office confirmed it was supporting the family of a woman who had died in Brazil and said it was in contact with the Brazilian authorities. \n \n In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Kelty\u2019s siblings, Piers, Giles and Natasha, said their \u201cactive and determined sister\u201d had recently embarked on the Pacific Crest Trail in the US, and had also explored the south pole and finally the Amazon river. \n \n \u201cIn a world that is today a much smaller place, the explorer in our sister found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are extremely proud of our sister who was dearly loved by us all and her strength will be sorely missed.\u201d",

On Sept. 13\u2014a day after remarking that she'd come across dozens of men in motor boats armed with arrows and rifles near Coari, an area known to be frequented by river pirates and drug traffickers\u2014Kelty sent out a distress signal and then went silent, reports the Guardian. Authorities now believe the 43-year-old British woman had pitched her tent on the banks of an Amazon tributary near Lauro Sodr\u00e9 when she was approached by men who shot her and threw her body in the river. A man and two 17-year-olds are in custody while police search for four other suspects who may have tried to sell Kelty's tech devices. A search for Kelty's body is also underway. A statement from Kelty's siblings note they're \"extremely proud\" of their sister, who sought \"to prove that challenges were achievable.\" (She had quit her job as a school principal in 2014 to travel solo.) Back in February, Kelty\u2014who became the sixth woman to ski solo to the South Pole in January\u2014told the BBC that surviving encounters with \"people who organ-harvest and rob and fire guns\" was \"half the challenge\" of her Amazon adventure. \"But it's about minimizing the risk,\" she said. \"I'm going to a self-defense course which is going to be tailored to de-arming people, so if I do come across that situation at least I'm prepared for it.\"",

Police are looking for four more suspects. \"This region is a problematic region for pirates,\" the state's public security secretary tells the Times of London. \"It is a region that has pirates, they do robberies, and it is a disputed region because there are a lot of drugs coming from Colombia.\" He says pirates attack Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers, steal their supplies, and throw their bodies in the Solimes river. Kelty's family says she \"found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable.\"",

    "document": "The FBI has uncovered evidence that foreign hackers penetrated two state election databases in recent weeks, prompting the bureau to warn election officials across the country to take new steps to enhance the security of their computer systems, according to federal and state law enforcement officials. \n \n The FBI warning, contained in a \u201cflash\u201d alert from the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, a copy of which was obtained by Yahoo News, comes amid heightened concerns among U.S. intelligence officials about the possibility of cyberintrusions, potentially by Russian state-sponsored hackers, aimed at disrupting the November elections. \n \n Those concerns prompted Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to convene a conference call with state election officials on Aug. 15, in which he offered his department\u2019s help to make state voting systems more secure, including providing federal cybersecurity experts to scan for vulnerabilities, according to a \u201creadout\u201d of the call released by the department. \n \n Johnson emphasized in the call that Homeland Security was not aware of \u201cspecific or credible cybersecurity threats\u201d to the election, officials said. But three days after that call, the FBI Cyber Division issued a potentially more disturbing warning, titled \u201cTargeting Activity Against State Board of Election Systems.\u201d The alert, labeled as restricted for \u201cNEED TO KNOW recipients,\u201d disclosed that the bureau was investigating cyberintrusions against two state election websites this summer, including one that resulted in the \u201cexfiltration,\u201d or theft, of voter registration data. \u201cIt was an eye opener,\u201d a senior law enforcement official said of the bureau\u2019s discovery of the intrusions. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s kind of serious, and we\u2019re investigating.\u201d \n \n The bulletin does not identify the states in question, but sources familiar with the document say it refers to the targeting by suspected foreign hackers of voter registration databases in Arizona and Illinois. In the Illinois case, officials were forced to shut down the state\u2019s voter registration system for 10 days in late July, after the hackers managed to download personal data on up to 200,000 state voters, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Elections, said in an interview. The Arizona attack was more limited, involving malicious software that was introduced into its voter registration system but no successful exfiltration of data, a state official said. \n \n FBI Flash PDF: Targeting Activity Against State Board of Election Systems >>> \n \n The FBI bulletin listed eight separate IP addresses that were the sources of the two attacks and suggested that the attacks may have been linked, noting that one of the IP addresses was used in both intrusions. The bulletin implied that the bureau was looking for any signs that the attacks may have attempted to target even more than the two states. \u201cThe FBI is requesting that states contact their Board of Elections and determine if any similar activity to their logs, both inbound and outbound, has been detected,\u201d the alert reads. \u201cAttempts should not be made to touch or ping the IP addresses directly.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d said Rich Barger, chief intelligence officer for ThreatConnect, a cybersecurity firm, who reviewed the FBI alert at the request of Yahoo News. \u201cTwo state election boards have been popped, and data has been taken. This certainly should be concerning to the common American voter.\u201d \n \n Barger noted that one of the IP addresses listed in the FBI alert has surfaced before in Russian criminal underground hacker forums. He also said the method of attack on one of the state election systems \u2014 including the types of tools used by the hackers to scan for vulnerabilities and exploit them \u2014 appears to resemble methods used in other suspected Russian state-sponsored cyberattacks, including one just this month on the World Anti-Doping Agency. \n \n The FBI did not respond to detailed questions about the alert, saying in a statement only that such bulletins are provided \u201cto help systems administrators guard against the actions of persistent cyber criminals.\u201d Menzel, the Illinois election official, said that in a recent briefing, FBI agents confirmed to him that the perpetrators were believed to be foreign hackers, although they were not identified by country. He said he was told that the bureau was looking at a \u201cpossible link\u201d to the recent highly publicized attack on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, which U.S. officials suspect was perpetrated by Russian government hackers. But he said agents told him they had reached no conclusions, and other experts say the hackers could also have been common cybercriminals hoping to steal personal data on state voters for fraudulent purposes, such as obtaining bogus tax refunds. \n \n Continue reading ||||| FILE - This Feb. 3, 2012, file photo shows FBI headquarters in Washington.

But I get stories that are so false and so dishonest.\u201d \n \n \u201cMartin Luther King\u2019s bust?\u201d Hannity mentioned, helpfully. (In a White House pool report about Trump\u2019s first actions after being sworn in, Time magazine journalist Zeke Miller had reported that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. Miller corrected the report minutes later, explaining the bust had been obscured by a door and a Secret Service agent. White House press secretary Sean Spicer called it \u201ca reminder of the media danger of tweet first, check facts later.\u201d) \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s a very serious change,\u201d Trump told Hannity tonight. \u201cBecause they\u2019re not saying the bust was taken out.

Some people have come in with evil intentions. Most haven\u2019t, I guess, but we can\u2019t take chances.\" \n \n A draft executive order, which Trump could sign as early as Saturday, reportedly would halt the United States' broader refugee program for 120 days and prohibit citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen from obtaining U.S. visas for at least 30 days. \n \n \"We\u2019ve taken in tens of thousands of people. We know nothing about them. They can say they vetted them. They didn\u2019t vet them, they have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don\u2019t know anything about them and they have no papers?\" Trump asked. \n \n TRUMP TO ORDER CONSTRUCTION OF US-MEXICO BORDER WALL; EXPECTED TO SUSPEND REFUGEE PROGRAM \n \n Trump also defended his executive order to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a key promise of his presidential campaign. \n \n \"The wall is necessary,\" Trump said. \"That\u2019s not just politics, and yet it is good for the heart of the nation because people want protection and a wall protects. All you\u2019ve got to do is ask Israel.\" \n \n The president also revisited the issue of torture, saying that he believes methods such as waterboarding are effective. However, Trump added that he would follow the advice of Defense Secretary James Mattis, who has argued against the use of such tactics. \n \n \"Look, I spoke with people who were in this world that we\u2019re talking about,\" Trump told Hannity. \"They said, \u2018Absolutely, it works.\u2019 Now, General Mattis said that he doesn\u2019t intend to use it. I\u2019m with him all the way. Do I believe it works? Yes, I do.\" \n \n The president also swiped at the media, which he said was made up of \"very hostile people\" and \"very angry people.\" \n \n WATCH: TRUMP STRATEGIST BANNON TORCHES NY TIMES, MAINSTREAM MEDIA \n \n \"The media \u2014 much of the media, not all of it \u2013 is very, very dishonest,\" Trump said. \"Honestly, it\u2019s fake news. It\u2019s fake.

We have obstructionists,\u201d Trump said, complaining about Democrats\u2019 treatment of other nominees, including Attorney General pick Jeff Sessions. The \u201cnuclear option,\u201d if pursued, would allow majority Republicans to seek approval of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee with just a simple majority, as opposed to a 60-vote threshold. \n \n The president also said he was examining the case of Navy sailor Kristian Saucier for a possible pardon. Saucier, 29, was sentenced to a year in prison for taking photos of parts of a submarine's nuclear propulsion system. As a candidate, Trump contrasted Saucier's treatment with the FBI's decision not to charge Hillary Clinton for using personal email while secretary of state. \n \n PARDON ME: NAVY SAILOR IN JAIL FOR SUBMARINE PHOTOS PLEADS FOR MERCY FROM TRUMP \n \n \"I think it\u2019s very unfair in light of what\u2019s happened with other people,\" said Trump, who added that he wouldn't even consider a pardon if not for the outcome of the Clinton investigation. \"How can you have somebody else get away with such a tremendous amount and then this person who takes a picture of his desk on an old submarine? Look, if China or Russia wanted information on that submarine, they\u2019ve had it for many years. That I can tell you.\"",

I think she hurt that whole cause.\" \"Disgrace\" is also a word he used to describe a recent tweet about his son, Barron, by now-suspended SNL writer Katie Rich. \"I don't mind some humor, but it's terrible,\" Trump said. \"For NBC to attack my 10-year-old son \u2026 it's a disgrace. He's a great boy. And it\u2019s not an easy thing for him. Believe me.\" He had thoughts on President Obama as well, who rode with him in a limo on Inauguration Day. \"What amazed me is that I was vicious to him in statements, he was vicious to me in statements, and here we are getting along \u2026 riding up Pennsylvania Avenue,\" he said, adding, \"I like him, he likes me \u2026 you're going to have to ask him, but I think he likes me.\" Moving on to official presidential business, he labeled ObamaCare a \"horror show\" and a \"disaster,\" said he had a Supreme Court justice nominee \"pretty much in my mind,\" and noted that even though Secretary of Defense Mattis doesn't advocate waterboarding, he himself \"absolutely\" believes it is effective, per Fox. On his long-talked-about wall, Trump said it was \"necessary.\" \"People want protection and a wall protects,\" he said. \"All you've got to do is ask Israel.\" (One possible way to pay for the wall: a 20% tax on Mexican imports.)",

Trump announced the move Thursday, saying Israel had \"proved its power\" after years of \"unprovoked attacks\" on the city. The White House said Friday that Trump had signed a bill into law Thursday making the city the capital of Israel, the first time such a change has been made under a president who has called the city a \"shithole.\" Trump said Thursday that he had decided to make Jerusalem the capital because the city \"has been failing for a long time\" and he wanted to make it \"a great place to live and work.\" The move angered Palestinians, who called it a \"gross violation\" of international law. \u2013 \"They're very hostile. These are very hostile people.\" That was President Trump's take on the media in an interview with Sean Hannity that aired Monday night on Fox News, the Hill reports. \"The New York Times, CNN, NBC, they've used the word 'liar' to describe you, as it relates, if you're talking about crowd size,\" Hannity said. \"They also colluded against you in a campaign.

When it was revealed that it was wrong, it wasn't even a story. Nobody even knows it.\" Trump also addressed a Time report that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. \"That's a very serious change,\" he told Hannity. \"Because they\u2019re not saying the bust was taken out. What they\u2019s saying is \u2013 President Trump sat down with Sean Hannity for an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News, and the president had some choice words for the media. \"The media\u2014much of the media, not all of it\u2014is very, very dishonest,\" he said. \"Honestly, it\u2019s fake news. It's fake. They make things up.\" Other highlights from the interview: On his immigration order: \"We don\u2019t need this. Some people have come in with evil intentions. Most haven\u2019t, I guess, but we can\u2019t take chances.\" On his Supreme Court pick: \"Pretty much in my mind.\" On ObamaCare: \"It actually explodes. And I told Republicans. I said, 'Look if you really want to do something, just let it explode, and then come begging us to fix it.' But that\u2019s not the right thing for the public because we have to get it fixed.\" On torture: \"Look, I spoke with people who were in this world that we\u2019re talking about.

    "document": "A convicted white-collar criminal was sentenced Wednesday for persuading his son to shoot him in the leg as part of a staged insurance scam a day before he was to set to start serving a decade-long federal prison term from a high-profile mortgage fraud case. \n \n U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown called Shannon Egeland's insurance scheme and concocted shooting, which led to the amputation of his left leg, \"an unthinkable kind of situation,'' and tacked on three years and 10 months to his 10-year sentence for mortgage fraud. \n \n The additional time resulted from Egeland's guilty plea in May to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the elaborate insurance scam, and for interstate failure to pay child support. \n \n Egeland, who stood on a prosthetic leg before the judge in U.S. District Court in Portland, said he's spent time reflecting the past 3 \u00bd years he's been in custody, and has realized he's in need of mental health counseling and treatment. He's now taking three mental health-related medications. \n \n \"What bothers me the most is my son - the pain is on him,'' Egeland said. \"The pain that he has shouldn't be there...I've had 3 \u00bd years to recognize I am broken...If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't...That will haunt me the rest of my life.'' \n \n On July 31, 2014, Egeland directed his son Rylan Egeland, then 17, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun along a roadside in Caldwell, Idaho, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a bogus disability insurance policy that he had applied for seven days earlier. \n \n The son shot Egeland in his lower legs and then left the scene. Egeland called 911 and claimed he was a victim of assault when he stopped to help a pregnant motorist. He told authorities he was suddenly hit in the head and shot along the side of the road. \n \n Egeland previously had pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009. Egeland was a co-owner of Desert Sun, which raised millions from local banks through a series of phony business plans and falsified loan applications. \n \n On Wednesday, prosecutors sought a five-year sentence for the insurance scam while Egeland's lawyer urged a two-year sentence to be served consecutive to the 10-year sentence he's already serving. \n \n Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland in a sentencing memo as a \"menace to society,'' who has been on a crime spree since 2004. Egeland came up with the trumped-up shooting plan to delay his prison sentence in the mortgage fraud case and benefit from fraudulently obtained disability insurance, he said. \n \n Bradford called Egeland a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,'' motivated by greed who recklessly manipulated his son. \n \n \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,'' Bradford wrote in the memo. \n \n Egeland had his teenage son obtain a 20-gauge shotgun, while Egeland got the ammunition and directed his son to shoot him in the legs on July 31, 2014. Seven days earlier, Egeland had submitted an application for a disability insurance policy to Standard Insurance, falsely claiming he had never been arrested or indicted for either a felony or misdemeanor in the prior 10 years, according to court records. \n \n Standard Insurance did not suffer an actual loss because the fraud was quickly detected, Bradford said. \n \n While on pretrial release in the mortgage fraud case, Egeland was accused of delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school in December 2010 and a year later, of perjury, accused of lying on the witness stand in the drug trial, prosecutors said. He was convicted of both at trial, but the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the drug conviction because of a jury instruction problem. In June 2013, Egeland also pleaded guilty to theft for shoplifting from Fred Meyer. \n \n At the time of the shooting, the senior Egeland was suffering from a \"perfect storm'' of medical and mental health issues and financial difficulties, and the \"anxiety of having to report for a 10-year federal prison sentence'' was weighing down on him, his defense lawyer Ryan O'Connor told the court. \n \n O'Connor urged the judge to consider that Egeland already faces a lengthy sentence that will be a challenge for him. \n \n \"This will be hard, difficult time for him because of his physical disability,'' O'Connor said. \"He understands he brought this on upon himself.'' \n \n Egeland also was ordered to pay the $90,011 he owes in child support. The judge urged him to get mental health treatment and counseling while in prison, and to submit to a new mental health evaluation when he gets out of custody. \n \n -- Maxine Bernstein \n \n mbernstein@oregonian.com \n \n 503-221-8212 \n \n @maxoregonian ||||| Image copyright Multnomah County Sheriff Image caption Shannon Egeland's plot backfired \n \n An Oregon mortgage fraudster has had his jail sentence extended by a judge after he made his teenage son shoot him in the legs in a bid to delay prison. \n \n Shannon Egeland, 43, lost his limb in the 2014 shooting, which he staged a day before he was due to report for a 10-year custodial term. \n \n The shooting came one week after he applied for disability insurance. \n \n A prosecutor described Egeland in a sentencing document as a \"menace to society\". \n \n \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,\" Scott Bradford wrote in the court memo. \n \n If Egeland had died in the stunt \"the minor child would have been left to deal with the consequences\", the assistant US attorney added. \n \n In 2014, Egeland was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in an extensive mortgage-fraud scheme, orchestrated through the housing development company where he worked as vice-president, reports KOIN, a TV news channel in Portland, Oregon. \n \n Authorities say he raised millions from local banks through a series of bogus business plans and falsified loan applications. \n \n A judge allowed him to self-surrender to prison. \n \n But Egeland concocted a plot to postpone his jail term and cash in on an insurance fraud, reports the Oregonian newspaper. \n \n He had his 17-year-old son shoot him in the lower legs with a 20 gauge shotgun on 31 July 2014. \n \n The teenager then left the scene on the side of the road in Caldwell, Idaho, about 30 miles (48km) west of Boise. \n \n Egeland called police and said he had been attacked after stopping to help a pregnant driver. \n \n He told police he was hit in the head and shot. \n \n A week before the shooting he had taken out a disability insurance policy, falsely claiming he had not been arrested in the past decade. \n \n The fraud was quickly detected. \n \n As a result of the gunshot, Egeland had his left leg amputated. \n \n He stood on a prosthetic limb as he addressed the court in the city of Portland on Wednesday. \n \n \"The injury that I sustained doesn't even bother me,\" Egeland told the judge during his sentencing hearing. \n \n \"What bothers me the most is my son.

We all like salt.\" \n \n Stewart said she's not really a snacker \u2014 when she does grab a bite to eat between meals, it's fruit \u2014 but believes a well-stocked pantry must have a few different types of crackers. She wouldn't serve her Triscuits alone, but would add crab meat and lime or avocado and hot pepper, and also suggests turning them into an elevated s'more by topping a cracker with melted milk chocolate and a marshmallow.

The cracker tastes like it was cooked in coconut oil and then salted; the sweet flavor isn't overpowering, nor does it have that \"hint of sunscreen\" taste that many coconut-flavored foods can't seem to shake. \n \n Stewart said she likes to watch people try the cracker for the first time because, she said, they almost always go back for seconds. But she herself can defeat the crispy, salty addiction: She says she's not much of a snacker, and when she does feel a hunger pang she eats fruit. Still, she always keeps crackers in the house -- Triscuits, Ritz and Saltines are the three that stock her pantry -- because of the salt factor. \n \n \"I like salt. My daughter likes salt. We all like salt,\" she said. Salt it is. \n \n While it's totally acceptable to eat Triscuits straight from the box, Stewart has some cracker combos that take the snack up a notch. She said if she were serving the crackers at a party, she'd top them with crab meat and lime or avocado with hot peppers. \n \n For a hot hors d'oeuvres, these salty-sweet crunchers pair well with melted cheese, or for the true bourgeoisie, a crab and truffle topping. For dessert, Stewart suggests melting milk chocolate on each square and adding a marshmallow. Now you have Martha Stewart-approved s'mores. \n \n What could be more honorable than that? \n \n Also on HuffPost: Martha Stewart's Modeling Career Martha Stewart's Modeling Career \n \n 1 of 13 Share this slide: \n \n MySpace ||||| Photo: Getty Images \n \n If anyone puts together a food time capsule for the year 2015, make sure to include the new limited edition summer offering from Triscuit \u2014 the Toasted Coconut & Sea Salt flavor created by the one and only Martha Stewart. The project and surrounding P.R. campaign manage to squeeze everything that\u2019s hot right now on, into, and around the 9-oz. box of crackers. Here\u2019s the evidence: \n \n \n \n 1. Martha. At 73, she\u2019s still the beloved icon that owns the domestic arts category. \n \n 2. Toasted coconut and sea salt. Totally on trend in terms of ingredients. Not on trend if you\u2019re a fan of all things local. This only counts as a local treat if you live in one of the top coconut-producing regions, like Indonesia or Sri Lanka. \n \n 3. Avocado. The Pharrell of food. It\u2019s everywhere, but we don\u2019t mind. And it collaborates so well with other foods \u2014 toast, tomato, crabmeat, eggs. The Triscuit box features a picture of the crackers with some avocado on top as a serving suggestion. Happy, indeed. \n \n 4. S\u2019mores. Yahoo Food has predicted that s\u2019mores might be the flavor of the year, given how many s\u2019mores-related edibles we\u2019ve seen to date. The back of the box shows another serving suggestion \u2014 a toasted marshmallow with chocolate atop one of the Martha Triscuits. Call it S\u2019mores Deluxe, no campfire required. \n \n 5. Pinterest. The Triscuit folks managed to get a link to its Pinterest page on the back of the box, too. If you\u2019re a dedicated Pinhead, you already know Triscuit recipes, from Triscuit pizza to Triscuit Parmesan crusted chicken tenders, are popular on the site. \n \n 6. Artisanal food. We\u2019re not talking about the Triscuits, which everyone acknowledges is a mass-produced packaged food. To celebrate the launch of the Martha Triscuits, the company commissioned five \u201cartisanal food producers\u201d to create a special product to be sold on each artisan\u2019s website. The products include: McClure\u2019s Olive Tapenade; The Jam Stand\u2019s Cherry Ginger Jam; Wondermade Marshmallow\u2019s Blackberry Mallow; Olympia Provisions\u2019 Summer Sausage; and Savannah Bee Company\u2019s Winter White Honey with Passion Fruit. \n \n 7. Entrepreneurs. Everyone is fascinated by entrepreneurs today. The press release for new flavor notes that Triscuit was originally founded in 1901 by an \u201centerprising small business owner.\u201d The release neglects to mention the founder, but it could be referring to Henry Perky, the founder of shredded wheat biscuits. \n \n All teasing aside, most serious foodies, chefs included, love Triscuits. The reason? The original version has three ingredients \u2014 whole grain wheat, vegetable oil, and sea salt \u2014 making it one of the more straightforward packaged snack foods around. Even the much-lauded Gabrielle Hamilton of New York\u2019s Prune restaurant famously featured Triscuits as a bar snack, albeit paired with sardines and mustard. She told T Magazine it\u2019s something she could eat \u201ctill the end of time.\u201d \n \n So how do the Martha Triscuits taste? The Yahoo Food team nibbled on some straight out of the box and was pleasantly surprised. There's a slight tang when the cracker hits your tongue, and the salty/sweet combo plays well with the wheat texture. Now all we need is some avocado. Or marshmallows. Or Martha. \n \n We love Martha Stewart here at Yahoo Food. Here\u2019s some coverage you might have missed.",

Cast members of \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" said he was taken out of the Foxwoods Theatre on W. 42nd St. on a gurney but didn't appear badly hurt. \n \n \"All signs were good as he was taken to the hospital for observation,\" said Rick Miramontez, spokesman for the $65 million production, which is in previews. \n \n He said the actor fell several feet, but audience members described a 20- to 30-foot plunge. The mishap came about seven minutes before the show's end, when Spidey's love interest, Mary Jane, runs up a ramp, followed by the stunt double in a Spider-Man costume, and both jump off. Mary Jane's harness held, but the stunt man's didn't. \n \n Theatergoer Mike James of San Jose, Calif., said, \"I'm pretty sure what wasn't supposed to happen is this guy topples off the stage ass over teakettle.\" He said the audience sat in stunned silence as the empty harness swung out over seats in the first few rows \"and someone under the stage started screaming, 'Call 911!' \" \n \n Tourist Terese DeLuca, 58, of Naples, Fla., said, \"At first we thought it was part of the show.\" \n \n There was a blackout after the accident, audience members said, and a delay was announced, and later it was announced the performance was over. \n \n The theater is dark on Tuesdays, and Miramontez did not say whether tomorrow's shows would go on. \n \n It was the third accident since previews began last month. An actor and a dancer suffered broken bones while attempting to do the slingshot flying technique, and then actress Natalie Mendoza suffered a concussion during the show's Dec. 2 performance. \n \n The show's opening has been delayed by four weeks to Feb. 7 for artistic overhaul. ||||| After an actor performing in the Broadway musical \u201cSpider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\u201d was injured during a performance Monday night, the show will postpone its scheduled matinee on Wednesday and resume performances on Wednesday night, according to a statement from a spokesman for the production. The actor, Christopher Tierney, was said to be in serious condition at Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday. Patrick Healy has more here. \n \n \u201cOSHA, Actors Equity and the New York State Department of Labor have met with the Spider-Man company today to discuss additional safety protocols,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt was agreed that these measures would be enacted immediately.\u201d The statement did not provide details of the new measures, and it was not clear who would take over for Mr. Tierney, a veteran dancer and stunt performers who plays the masked Spider-Man in some of the most complicated technical scenes of the musical. A later statement, from Actors\u2019 Equity, said that it had been determined that the cause of the accident was \u201chuman error.\u201d \n \n Theatergoers who attended Monday\u2019s performance of \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d a $65 million musical featuring complicated aerial stunts, said that they saw a performer playing the title hero fall into a pit during the closing minutes of the show, and that some equipment fell into the audience when this occurred. A video of the performance showed a line holding the performer apparently snap. \n \n Mr. Tierney and other actors play Spider-Man throughout the show during various stunts and action sequences. \n \n On Tuesday morning, news media representatives for \u201cSpider-Man\u201d did not immediately reply to an inquiry about the identity of the actor or his status. But the \u201cSpider-Man\u201d actress Natalie Mendoza, who plays the spider-goddess Arachne, wrote on her Twitter feed: \u201cPlease pray with me for my friend Chris, my superhero who quietly inspires me everyday with his spirit. A light in my heart went dim tonight.\u201d \n \n Mr. Tierney sustained broken ribs and suffered some internal bleeding as a result of falling from the platform, according to a person familiar with his medical condition, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private medical information. It was not clear precisely how many feet he fell before landing. Julie Taymor, the musical\u2019s director, visited with the actor in his hospital room on Tuesday. A spokesman for the production said early Tuesday afternoon that he had no details about the cause of the accident or steps that will be taken as a result of it to help insure the safety of the show\u2019s performers. \n \n Safety inspectors with the New York State Department of Labor visited Broadway\u2019s Foxwoods Theater on Tuesday morning to examine equipment that appeared to malfunction at Monday night\u2019s performance and met with the musical\u2019s lead producer, Michael Cohl. \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking to the production team, checking the harnesses, cables, and other equipment, and trying to determine what happened, and we\u2019ll have more information after that,\u201d said a department spokesman, Leo Rosales, in a telephone interview on Tuesday morning. \n \n The labor department has signoff authority on productions with public performances, and had approved the show going forward with performances in November. A spokeswoman for Actors\u2019 Equity, the union of theater actors and stage managers, said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cWe were informed shortly after the accident during the performance of Spiderman. We are working in cooperation with the state and city Department of Labor on this situation. We don\u2019t have a further statement at this time.\u201d \n \n Actors\u2019 Equity said later in an updated statement: \u201cActors\u2019 Equity Association is working with management and the Department of Labor to ensure that performances will not resume until back-up safety measures are in place.\u201d \n \n Steven Tartick, an audience member, said the accident occurred during a scene when Spider-Man is rescuing his love interest, Mary Jane, as she dangles from a rope attached to a bridge. \n \n Mr. Tartick said he saw the actor playing Spider-Man appear to trip and fall from the bridge, into an open pit at the end of the stage. \n \n \u201cYou heard screams,\u201d Mr. Tartick said. \u201cYou heard a woman screaming and sobbing.\u201d \n \n Mr. Tartick said there was a blackout, and then the house lights in the theater were restored. An announcement made in the theater first said there would be a delay in the performance. The announcement was then updated to say the show was over. \n \n Scott Smith and Matthew Smith, brothers who attended Monday\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man\u201d performance, watched the show from the balcony of the Foxwoods Theater. In an interview outside the theater, Matthew Smith said: \u201cIt looked like it was supposed to happen. But he fell at a faster pace. It didn\u2019t look right.\u201d \n \n Brian Lynch, an audience member, described the scene at the Foxwoods Theater on his Twitter feed, writing: \u201cStopped short near end. Someone took nasty fall. Screaming. 911 called. No idea what happened, kicked audience out.\u201d He added: \u201cNo joke. No explanation. MJ and Spidey took what seemed to be a planned fall into the stage pit. Then we heard MJ screaming.\u201d \n \n Christine Bord, another eyewitness, described events outside the theater in a blog post on her Web site, onlocationvacations.com. \n \n In a telephone interview, Ms. Bord said two ambulances and a fire truck were already waiting outside the theater when most audience members exited. The actor was quickly brought out on a stretcher, wrapped in protective gear and wearing a neck brace. He acknowledged the crowd, which clapped for him before an ambulance took him away. Ms. Bord said this transpired in no more than five or 10 minutes. \n \n John Matthews/onlocationvacations.com \n \n The \u201cSpider-Man\u201d musical has faced several setbacks during its preview period, with one of its actresses suffering a concussion and two actors injured by a sling-shot technique meant to propel them across the stage.

On Tuesday, the Pax Hotel Group, which owns the inn, posted a statement on Instagram confirming that its general manager was involved, condemned his actions, and said that he had been fired. \n \n \"Our team has gone ahead and took the actions necessary,\" the group said, adding that it does not \"stand behind the actions of our former general manager...we would like to apologize to those affected by the actions of our former employee.\" \n \n In a message to residents Monday night, the apartment complex's management said Crandall is not a resident of the building, Stadium Centre, which is marketed as off-campus housing to college students in Tallahassee. \n \n \u201cFirearms are prohibited on our property and we take this matter very seriously,\u201d the management said in the message, which Butterfield sent to BuzzFeed News. \u201cMoreover, we are firmly committed to creating a diverse residential community that is inclusive and welcoming to all.\u201d \n \n In an interview, Butterfield described the encounter, which he said occurred while he and three friends \u2014 Stephen Brooks, Joshua Cosby, and Fitzroy Rhoden \u2014 were waiting at the garage entrance to the apartment building. Another friend, Zavian Flowers, had just moved into the building and was throwing a party, Butterfield said. \n \n As they waited for Flowers to let them in, Crandall walked past them and through the door. \n \n \u201cThen he turned and he said, \u2018You aren\u2019t getting in here if you don't have a key,\u2019\u201d Butterfield said. \u201cWe were shook because we hadn\u2019t said anything to him. We were just standing there and then he closed the door and locked it.\u201d \n \n According to the junior, Crandall, who is white, came back a few moments later and began harassing the students again. The encounter then caught the attention of another man \u2014 whom Butterfield identified as \u201cChad\u201d \u2014 who intervened on the students\u2019 behalf. \n \n \n \n \u201cHe came at us for no reason and that\u2019s when Chad walked up and I started recording,\u201d Butterfield said. \u201cChad stood up for us and pushed back on the guy and said we could come in with him.\u201d",

Butterfield then started filming. The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. \"He made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator,\" says Butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. (At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, \"Where am I going? I am going upstairs to get laid.\") The students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day. Building management has since released a statement saying the man in the video is not a resident.

    "document": "For years, cognitive scientist Lars Chittka felt a bit eclipsed by his colleagues at Queen Mary University of London. Their studies of apes, crows, and parrots were constantly revealing how smart these animals were. He worked on bees, and at the time, almost everyone assumed that the insects acted on instinct, not intelligence. \"So there was a challenge for me: Could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher?\" he recalls. Now, it seems he has succeeded at last. \n \n Chittka\u2019s team has shown that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward, but they can also learn this trick from other bees, even though they have no experience with such a task in nature. The study \u201csuccessfully challenges the notion that 'big brains' are necessary\" for new skills to spread, says Christian Rutz, an evolutionary ecologist who studies bird cognition at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom. \n \n Many researchers have used string pulling to assess the smarts of animals, particularly birds and apes. So Chittka and his colleagues set up a low clear plastic table barely tall enough to lay three flat artificial blue flowers underneath. Each flower contained a well of sugar water in the center and had a string attached that extended beyond the table's boundaries. The only way the bumble bee could get the sugar water was to pull the flower out from under the table by tugging on the string. \n \n Video of Hints of tool use, culture seen in bumblebees \n \n The team put 110 bumble bees, one at a time, next to the table to see what they would do. Some tugged at the strings and gave up, but two actually kept at it until they retrieved the sugar water. In another series of experiments, the researchers trained the bees by first placing the flower next to the bee and then moving it ever farther under the table. More than half of the 40 bees tested learned what to do, Chittka and his colleagues report this week in PLOS Biology . \n \n Next, the researchers placed untrained bees behind a clear plastic wall so they could see the other bees retrieving the sugar water. More than 60% of the insects that watched knew to pull the string when it was their turn. In another experiment, scientists put bees that knew how to pull the string back into their colony and a majority of the colony's workers picked up string pulling by watching one trained bee do it when it left the colony in search of food. The bees usually learned this trick after watching the trained bee five times, and sometimes even after one observation. Even after the trained bee died, string pulling continued to spread among the colony\u2019s younger workers. \n \n But pulling a string does not quite qualify as tool use, because it would have to be an independent object that wasn\u2019t attached to the flower in the first place. And other invertebrates have shown they can use tools: Digger wasps pick up small stones and use them to pack down their burrow entrances, for example. But that two bees figured out how to pull the string with no help and further, that other bees could pick up on that ability was \u201cmost impressive,\u201d says Ivo Jacobs, a cognitive zoologist at Lund University in Sweden who was not involved with the work. \u201cThe fact that bumble bees could learn to do so shows their unexpected behavioral flexibility.\u201d \n \n The findings could also hint at a rudimentary form of culture in bees, Jacobs says. With their ability to learn where others are, find out what they are doing, and experimenting on their own, the insects demonstrated that they can pass on knowledge\u2014a key requirement of culture, normally considered to be a more complex phenomena, he explains. \u201cIt's interesting to see that the bees have this capacity.\" \n \n Rutz is impressed, too, because the work involved almost 300 bees and clearly documented how string pulling spread from bee to bee in multiple colonies. Cognitive studies of vertebrates like birds and monkeys typically involve about an order of magnitude fewer individuals, he notes. \n \n With additional experiments, Chittka hopes to figure out the neural basis of these \u201csmarts\u201d in the bumble bees. He cautions that the insects might not be all that intelligent, but that instead, \u201cthese results may mean that culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\u201d ||||| Conversely, after 48 h of extensive training (20 instances of string pulling), 11 of the 15 foragers solved the task without feedback from the moving blue flower ( S5 Video ). Latency to obtaining the reward (147 \u00b1 23.44 s) was much higher than for normal blue flower training (22.1 \u00b1 1.5 s; t test: t25 = 6.25, p < 0.0001). The subjects\u2019 success differs significantly from their performance when they were relatively inexperienced (McNemar Test, \u03c7 2 1 = 7.111, p = 0.008), thus indicating that the majority of highly experienced individuals may no longer require visual feedback to perform the necessary sequence of motor actions. In fact, experienced bees may not need the blue flower at all and perhaps have associated the string with the reward. \n \n The success of bees learning such a behavior raises the question about the mechanisms by which the demonstrators learned to pull the string. One possibility is that demonstrators are stimulated to repeat the specific sequence of actions (moving the string with their legs) that induces the conditioned stimulus (i.e., the blue flower positioned under the table) to move a little closer. If so, we would expect bees not to move the string with their legs and fail at the task if the colored target stimulus is not present. To test this prediction, we challenged bees (Colony 2) to access the reward when a string was attached to only a colorless inverted Eppendorf cap containing sucrose solution (Materials and Methods) immediately after their initial stepwise training and then again after extensive experience with blue flowers and strings. Without a colored stimulus, only 2 of 15 bees tested obtained the reward after their initial training. We thus hypothesized that relatively inexperienced bees rely on visual feedback of the colored target moving closer while the string is being pulled. To explore this further, we examined the video material for the unsuccessful bees to see if they would attempt to pull the strings and then abort this action when visual feedback was not forthcoming. However, none of the unsuccessful bees demonstrated even an aborted pulling action on the colorless flower\u2019s string. This suggests that most relatively inexperienced bees require the presence of the blue flower to even begin attempting to string pull. (However, there is also evidence for the importance of visual feedback during pulling from an experiment with coiled strings; see section The Mechanisms of Observational Learning in String Pulling.) \n \n In comparison, we were able to train 23 of 40 individuals (Colony 1) through a stepwise training procedure to successfully pull a string to obtain reward ( Fig 1B horizontal black bar in column 4, S1 \u2013 S4 Videos). The stepwise training consisted of four steps of incremental difficulty within which flowers with strings were placed at progressively more distant positions under the transparent table (Steps 1\u20134, Fig 1A and 1B ). On average, successful training for an individual bee took 309 \u00b1 18 min. Gaining access to the reward in the final step required grasping the string with the forelegs and/or mandibles and pulling it closer ( S4 Video ). The mean time required (latency) to obtain sucrose decreased significantly as a function of experience within each of the four successive training phases (Friedman test, Step 1: \u03c7 2 4 = 59.1, p = <0.001; Step 2: \u03c7 2 4 = 53.1, p = <0.001; Step 3: \u03c7 2 4 = 52.1, p = <0.001; Step 4: \u03c7 2 10 = 92.3, p < 0.001; Fig 1C and 1D ). Eight, three, one, and five individuals gave up at Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, either because they ceased foraging activity or had irregular foraging activity (n = 11), or because they failed to obtain the reward (n = 6). Three of these successfully trained bees were later used as demonstrators in the social learning experiment. \n \n (A) Arena set up for the observation of string pulling. (B) The various testing procedures. Tests 1 and 2 were identical and consisted of giving 5 min to individual bees to solve the string pulling task. After having been trained to forage from blue artificial flowers, bees were tested a first time (Test 1). Then, demonstrators were trained (see Fig 1 ) and used to display string pulling (two instances, straight strings) during each of five foraging bouts to individual observers (n = 52) placed in a transparent Plexiglas cage. After the observation phase, 25 observers were tested again with the straight-string task (Test 2) and 27 with the coiled-string task. Fifteen different bees observed the flower moving without visible actor so that a forager could then obtain the sucrose solution (\u201cGhost control\u201d) and, where tested, with the straight-string task subsequently. Untrained bees (n = 25) were also tested a second time with string pulling. (C) Percentage of successful untrained, social, and nonsocial observer bees in Tests 1 and 2. Asterisk: Fisher\u2019s exact test, p \u2264 0.0001. Double S: McNemar test, \u03c7 2 1 = 13.067, p < 0.001. (D) Mean \u00b1 s.e. (s) latency in accessing the reward in untrained and observer bees.

Successive steps: Step 0, pretraining on blue artificial flowers (note that all bees were trained on this step); Step 1, 50% of the flower covered by the transparent table; Step 2, 75% of the flower covered; Steps 3 and 4, 100% of the flower covered. The flower was positioned at the edge in Step 3 and 2 cm under the table in Step 4. (B) Percentage of successful bees in Steps 1 to 4 (n = 40, 32, 29, and 28, respectively). Black horizontal lines within bars indicate the percentage of bees of the original 40. (C) and (D), mean \u00b1 standard error (s.e.) (line and shaded area, s) latency to obtain the reward in Steps 1\u20133 and 4. (C) Mean latency for the five foraging bouts of Steps 1\u20133. Data points, from left to right, in (D) indicate the latency to reward in Step 4 for the bout with first occurrence of string pulling and the ten foraging bouts that followed. Bees needed 6.17 \u00b1 1.2 foraging bouts before displaying string pulling in Step 4 (see S1 Data ). \n \n To test bees\u2019 capacity to learn the technique of string pulling, we first challenged untrained individuals with a stepwise training procedure (Materials and Methods; S1 \u2013 S4 Videos). We presented individual bees with three blue artificial flowers with a string attached to each flower and placed under a small transparent Plexiglas table (Materials and Methods). After learning to associate the reward with artificial flowers in a flight arena (Step 0, Fig 1A ), but prior to string pulling training, none of the bees from the eight colonies in which individuals were tested singly (n = 291) could solve the string pulling task on their first 5-min attempt (Test 1, Fig 2B ). Na\u00efve to the string task but attracted to the artificial flowers, these bees tried to reach the reward from the top of the table through the Plexiglas. \n \n We gave 50 individuals (Colony 1) the opportunity to solve the string pulling task spontaneously after having learnt that blue flowers are rewarding when they were openly accessible during pretraining (for a 5-min observation period). None of these individuals solved the task. When given a second 5-min opportunity, two of 25 untrained bees succeeded in obtaining the reward ( S6 Video ). However, they were more than ten times slower at obtaining the reward than experienced string pullers (22.1 \u00b1 1.5 s, mean \u00b1 standard error [s.e.], Mann\u2013Whitney U test, U 23 < 0.001, p = 0.024), requiring a relatively long latency of 245 \u00b1 3.53 s. These two bees were exceptionally explorative, trying a wide variety of methods, and solved the task in several attempts by moving the string accidently while trying to reach the flower under the table (see S6 Video and legend for more information). This shows clearly that string pulling can be learned individually by some bumblebees, but this may be an exceptionally rare ability. Across experiments (see below), 291 na\u00efve individuals were tested once, and a total 110 were tested twice, but no further \u201cinnovators\u201d were found. In one experiment (the transmission chain experiment below, in which control colonies were not seeded with a skilled demonstrator), bees were given extensive opportunities. After 5 d of foraging, with a maximum number of 18 foraging bouts per individual, no single bee learned to pull the string. Of the 165 bees tested in this experiment in total, nine individuals were tested more than 10 times, and 26 more than 5 times, but all were invariably unsuccessful. Thus, solving a string pulling task spontaneously is a relatively rare occurrence in bumblebees and might either reflect an unusually explorative \u201cpersonality\u201d in these individuals or simple \u201cluck\u201d in the process of random exploration. \n \n Finally, because smaller bees might be able to reach further under the table than larger bees, we examined whether body size influenced success in solving the task (Colony 1). Thorax width (as a proxy for body size) was not different between demonstrators (n = 40), observers (n = 25), and untrained bees (n = 25) (ANOVA, F 69 = 0.728, p = 0.486). Thorax width affected neither demonstrators\u2019 (Student\u2019s t test, t 26 = 0.659, p = 0.516) nor observers\u2019 success rate (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, U 23 = 79, p = 0.846). Similarly, the latency to obtain the reward was not affected by thorax width of demonstrators (Pearson correlation, r 23 = -0.086, p = 0.696) or observers (Pearson correlation, r 15 = 0.375, p = 0.169). \n \n We also wished to disentangle the effects of demonstrator copying and object movement copying in how string pulling was learnt by observation. To this end, we used an experimental \u201cghost control\u201d ([ 40 ], S8 Video ). We trained 15 nonsocial observers (Colony 3) in exactly the same manner as above with the modification that the flowers were moved without a visible actor: an experimenter pulled the flowers with thin nylon threads attached to the strings while the observers were locked inside the observation chamber (Materials and Methods). Once the string had been pulled, an untrained forager was released into the arena to feed from the now accessible flower. Without direct demonstration of string pulling by a bumblebee forager, none of the observers managed to solve the string pulling task. Nonsocial observers mostly tried to obtain the reward from the top of the table, indicating that the bees need to observe string pulling actions demonstrated by conspecifics to learn the technique. However, because no video material is available to show that observer bees directed their gaze towards the moving flower, it is also possible that in the absence of a conspecific demonstrator, observers simply failed to attend to the movement of the flower. \n \n We explored whether uninformed bees (Colony 1) could learn this novel foraging technique via observation. After pretraining on blue flowers and Test 1 (Materials and Methods), an uninformed observer bee was placed in a transparent chamber ( Fig 2A ) where it could observe a demonstrator solve the string pulling task ten times. These observers (n = 25) were subsequently tested on the string pulling task alone (Test 2, Fig 2B ). In this experiment, observers never interacted directly with demonstrators in the flight arena and had access only to visual social information ( S7 Video ). Sixty percent of the individuals (15 of 25) that had the opportunity to observe a skilled demonstrator managed to pull the string and obtained the reward on the first trial after having observed the demonstration (Test 2, Fig 2C , S6 Video ). These bees, however, were initially almost as slow as the two individuals that solved the tasks without demonstration (181 \u00b1 19 s; Fig 2D ). We speculate that the observers picked up the correct location to access the reward from observing skilled demonstrators but did not learn from them the actual technique of string pulling (further explored in the section beneath about the mechanisms of social learning). \n \n Finally, trial-and-error learning was also evident in the learning process. Because individuals might only learn where to obtain the reward and then learn the string pulling by trial-and-error, observer bees (n = 27, Colony 5) were tested with a coiled-string paradigm where trial-and-error learning of actions causing the rewarding object moving closer is ineffective. After a standard demonstration of string pulling (Materials and Methods), a 14 cm string was attached to the flower and coiled under the table so that initial tugs on the string would provide no visual feedback of the flower moving closer to the bee. Such coiled-string tests have in the past been used to test whether animals can solve a string pulling puzzle by means-end comprehension, without the perceptual feedback of the reward coming closer [ 44 , 45 ]. Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) [ 47 ] and wolves (Canis lupus) [ 48 ] have indeed been shown to solve the task even if the string is coiled. However, none of these observer bees were able to solve this task (n = 27, Fig 2B , S10 Video ), indicating that observers did not glean information about the string pulling technique itself by observing a demonstrator but instead were merely guided to the demonstrator\u2019s previous location (by local enhancement) and the position of the string (stimulus enhancement). The actual act of string pulling relied on individual trial-and-error learning, which in turn necessitates the sensory feedback of tugging on the string, resulting in the target moving closer. We also tested eight experienced individuals (with an experience of more than 20 instances of string pulling) with the coiled-string test; three of these bees succeeded in pulling the coiled string to obtain the reward ( S11 Video ), indicating that highly experienced individuals do not necessarily require the feedback from seeing the flower move closer while they pull the string. In summary, these results suggest that observational learning of the string pulling task does not involve the \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the task (\u201cinsight\u201d) but the combined use of several simple associative mechanisms and trial-and-error learning. \n \n (A) Regions of interest used for the video analysis of bee behaviors (not true to scale): the original region (where the demonstrator pulled a string, solid dark grey), top region (on the table, solid light grey), the two regions where the string could be presented when it was at variance with the location during the observation phase in the stimulus enhancement tests (thin grey stripes on black) and the adjacent regions where no string was presented (thin black stripes on grey). When testing stimulus enhancement, bees were challenged with a string protruding on the opposite side of one of Plexiglas tables or at 90\u00b0 compared to the location where it was seen during observational conditioning (dotted lines). Regions were all 16 cm 2 (adjacent areas: 8 x 2 cm; top region 4 x 4 cm). (B) Mean \u00b1 s.e. (s) time spent by unsuccessful observer (n = 10) and unsuccessful untrained bees in two of the four regions of interest in their first attempt to retrieve the reward (Test 1) the second attempt (Test 2). Light grey: top of table; dark grey: region where string protruded during observation. Asterisk: Friedman test, p < 0.01; letters and figures: post-hoc Tukey test. (C) Percentage of time spent by observer bees in the four regions of interest when the string was protruding in the region where bees had observed demonstrators (left bar, unsuccessful observers, n = 10) or the region of the table where the string protruded when it was incongruent with that seen from the observation chamber (right bar, bees tested for stimulus enhancement, n = 14). The shades in the various regions of the stacked bars correspond to the shades in Fig 3A (see S1 Data ). \n \n To examine the local and stimulus enhancement possibilities, we analyzed the video footage to determine the time bees spent in four different regions of the arena (see Fig 3A , Materials and Methods). In Test 2, unsuccessful observers (n = 10, Colony 1) spent more time in the region where the demonstrator was observed (Friedman test, \u03c7 2 3 = 14.160, p = 0.003, Fig 3B ), and untrained bees (n = 23, Colony 1) spent more time on top of the table closest to the flower (Friedman test, \u03c7 2 3 = 35.162, p < 0.001, Fig 3B ) than in Test 1, indicating that local enhancement played a part in learning. None of the bees managed to obtain the reward when the string protruded in an area incongruent with that seen during demonstration. However, the string itself also played a role. If the string protruded from a different side of the table compared to the location during the observation period, observer bees (Test 2, n = 14, Colony 4; S9 Video ) spent more time exploring the region with the string than the region where the demonstrator had been observed (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, U 22 = 105, p = 0.038, Fig 3C ), indicating that observers had noticed the string during the observation period and were thus attracted to it. In theory, however, these longer dwelling times in the string region might be explained by bees randomly exploring the edges of the table and simply stopping at a region that contains any protruding object. To explore this possibility, we also evaluated bees\u2019 first approach flights after being released from the observation chamber before they had a chance of interacting with the string. If the string was in the same location as during observation, 92% of observers flew straight to the side of the string. When the location of the string was incongruent with demonstrator location, only 28.5% of observers first visited the region where the demonstrator had been observed (where chance expectation is 25%). The choice frequencies for the four sides of the table are significantly different depending on whether the string was in the correct location (Chi-square of fit, \u03c7 2 4 = 206.857, p < 0.0001), indicating that bees were able to see the string from the observation chamber and responded differently when it was presented in an unexpected location. However, there was no appreciable attraction to the string when its location was at variance with that seen from the observation chamber (28.5%). Taken together, these results indicate a strong role for local enhancement (bees were attracted to the location where they had observed a demonstrator) and a subordinate role for stimulus enhancement (bees were attracted to the string when its location was concordant with that during prior observation) [ 25 , 46 ]. \n \n What mechanisms were the observers using to copy the behavior? To answer this question, we explored several associative mechanisms: local enhancement [ 30 , 41 , 42 ], whereby observers are attracted to the location of their conspecific; stimulus enhancement [ 30 , 43 ], an attraction to the item handled by the demonstrator; and perceptual feedback [ 44 , 45 ], a form of trial-and-error learning in which action causing movement of the rewarding object towards the animal produces positive feedback for continuing that action. We found that all three associative mechanisms were involved in the learning of the string pulling process. \n \n The Spread of String Pulling in a Transmission Chain Experiment \n \n Can the combination of multiple simple social learning mechanisms mediate the establishment of a culture-like phenomenon (e.g. group-specific behaviors, such as foraging techniques, that are transmitted via social learning and retained in the group over long periods)? We tracked the diffusion of an experimentally introduced string pulling behavior among foragers of test colonies (Colonies 6, 7, 8) to explore the speed of diffusion and also the retention of the technique in the group beyond the demonstration provided by the first knowledgeable individual. To seed the technique, we trained a single demonstrator per colony to pull the string. Subsequently, we allowed pairs of bees to engage with the string pulling task and tracked the diffusion of the technique among the foraging population (Materials and Methods, Fig 4). Pairs of bees were tested in the order in which they arrived in the corridor connecting the hive to the arena; pairs could be any combination of bees regardless of whether they were na\u00efve, the seeded demonstrator, or a successful learner (S12 Video). As a control, foragers of three separate colonies were tested in the same manner without a seeded demonstrator (Colonies 9, 10, 11). \n \n PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image \n \n larger image TIFF original image Download: Fig 4. Cultural diffusion paradigm. Bees were group-trained to feed from blue flowers in the foraging arena. Three bees were trained to pull a string to obtain an artificial flower from under a table where they would get reward (sucrose solution; see Fig 1A). These three demonstrators were placed in colonies 6, 7, and 8 (one each; seeded colonies), and bees that came out of the colony were paired up in order of exit from the hive to forage within the arena and tested with the string pulling task. Each bout was capped at 5 min, and we recorded 150 foraging bouts (150 bee pairs). In colonies 9, 10, and 11 (control colonies), no trained demonstrator was present. 150 foraging bouts were recorded (150 bee pairs) (see S2 Data). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564.g004 \n \n After only 150 paired foraging bouts, a large proportion of each of the test colonies\u2019 forager population (Colony 6: n = 25/47, Colony 7: n = 17/29, Colony 8: n = 12/28) learnt to string pull, whereas none of the control colony foragers (Colony 9, 10, 11: n = 51, 58, 57) learnt to pull the string (Fig 5, Materials and Methods, S13\u2013S18 Videos). We conducted additional foraging bouts in two of the tested colonies and found that the technique continued to spread among the foragers for as long as we allowed the spread to progress (Colony 6: 34/47, Colony 8: 18/28, Fig 5, S13 and S15 Videos). \n \n PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image \n \n larger image TIFF original image Download: Fig 5.

See bottom insert for indication of node color and learning generation. Networks for the experiments (A\u2013C) only show interactions within bouts where at least one bee pulled the string at least once. (A) Network for test colony 6 (bout n = 189).

(F) Network for control colony 11 (bout n = 150) (see S2 Data). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564.g005 \n \n We quantified the behavioral changes in learner bees over the time of the diffusion experiments. We first screened 81 of the total 419 available videos (~20%) of the paired bouts between demonstrators and learners and inventoried the repertoire of behavioral interactions. We listed 11 types of interactions (Table 1), the frequency of which changed with increasing experience of the learners (Fig 6). Behaviors went through a series of steps with increasing competence, which typically followed the following sequence. During an observer bee\u2019s first few bouts, she would spend most of her time flying around the arena, occasionally landing on top of the table (NI, No Interaction) and spend little or no time near the table, strings, or the other bee. She would gradually start to land beside a bee who had already pulled a string for reward, thereby gaining reward without pulling a string (Sc, scrounging). The observer thus learns to associate the other bee with reward and typically begins following her around the table, keeping in close contact as they both walk (Fo, following). After one or more occurrences of scrounging, the observer bee would begin to reach under the table, sometimes extending her proboscis towards the flower, seemingly in an attempt to gain access to the flower without manipulating the string. While moving around the edge of the table and trying to reach under it, the observer bee might accidentally move a string, but make no subsequent effort to continue moving it (AMS, Accidentally Moving String). Often the observer bee would then position herself next to the bee already pulling a string. She would be in direct contact with the string pulling bee throughout the pull, usually not touching the string (A, Attending), although in some instances ineffectively manipulating the string (STA, String Touching while Attending), and ultimately gaining reward through the other bee\u2019s efforts. Eventually, while in direct contact with a more knowledgeable bee, the observer bee would pull the string, but not enough to move the flower close enough to the edge of the table, extract it, and obtain the reward (PA, Pulling Action with demonstrator). In this phase, she would still rely on the efforts by the more experienced bee to obtain the reward (RP, Rewarded Pull). After more experience, the observer bee would attempt to pull the string on her own without interacting with the other bee, for example, while the demonstrator was flying around the arena. On the first few attempts to string pull on their own, the observer bees did not move the flower enough to be able to obtain the reward (PAa, Pulling Action alone). Finally, after few unrewarded attempts, and typically when paired with a less knowledgeable bee, the observer bee would learn to pull the string on her own to the point of extracting the flower from underneath the table and gaining reward (RPa, Rewarded Pulling alone) and become a trained observer. \n \n PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image \n \n larger image TIFF original image Download: Fig 6. Change in learners\u2019 behavioral interactions. Stacked bars represent the proportion of interactions observed as a function of experience (number of paired foraging bouts). Colors indicate behavioral interactions (abbreviations, see Table 1). We evaluated the behavior of 15 randomly selected individuals (5 from each test colony that had been seeded with a trained demonstrator) for these interactions, scrutinizing 174 5-min videos totaling 14.5 h of footage (see S2 Data). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564.g006 \n \n These changes in behavior are reflected in the relative frequencies of behavior classes as a function of experience (Fig 6). Whilst nonsocial interactions such as NI and Sc represented more than 55% of the interactions at the onset of the diffusion experiment, they decreased rapidly to 0% over time (Fig 6). In comparison, the percentage of pulling actions displayed by the learners continuously increased with experience from 15% of the interactions at the onset to 60% after 11 bouts. Overall, no major change was observed for the other behavior classes. These results show that learners progressively changed their foraging behaviors from scroungers to competent string pullers. \n \n In test colonies, on average 2 \u00b1 0.06 string pulls were performed per foraging bout and 20 \u00b1 3.9 pulls were displayed per individual over the whole diffusion experiment. Bees needed to be shown 5 \u00b1 0.45 instances of string pulling by an experienced demonstrator before being able to pull the string themselves without demonstration and subsequently demonstrate the technique. Notably, 15 of 104 foragers (Colony 6, 7, 8: n = 10, 3, 2, respectively) picked up the technique very rapidly after only one or two observations. There was a significant variation between tested colonies in the average number of string pulls displayed per bee (Colony 6, 7, 8: n = 13 \u00b1 4.7, 15.4 \u00b1 9.2, 34.5 \u00b1 7.6, respectively; Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, H 2 = 8.790, p = 0.012) and the number of observations necessary for a bee to learn the technique (Colony 6, 7, 8: n = 4.1 \u00b1 0.4, 7.6 \u00b1 1.1, 5.9 \u00b1 0.9, respectively; Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, H 2 = 17.179, p \u2264 0.001). In addition, some bees did not manage to acquire the technique despite having been shown the same number of string pulling by other bees (5.6 \u00b1 0.7; Mann\u2013Whitney test, U 93 = 1075.5, p = 0.261). These results suggest colony and individual variation in social learning ability. \n \n To determine whether experience of the second bee influenced the observer bee\u2019s choice of string to pull, we analyzed the pulling behavior of 25 randomly selected observer bees over the complete sequence of their foraging career during the diffusion experiment (282 paired foraging bouts). We found that observer bees more often pulled the same string as the other bee when paired with a more experienced observer bee or the seeded demonstrator (42 RP instances) than when paired with a less experienced bee (9 RP instances). In contrast, observer bees more often pulled a string alone when paired with a less experienced bee (72 RPa instances) than when paired with a more experienced observer bee or a seeded demonstrator (27 RPa instances). \n \n To test whether bees might cooperate during string pulling, we needed to compare whether experienced bees performed more efficiently when paired with another experienced individual than when foraging alone. Because the diffusion experiment contained only trials with dyads of foragers, the only way to make a direct comparison was to use trials in which an experienced demonstrator was paired with a fully na\u00efve individual that had not shown any pulling action (PA, PAa, RP, or RPa) and thus did not interact or interfere with the skilled forager, who pulled the string singly. Such pairings were compared with instances where both bees were experienced (had already displayed a pulling action). We hypothesized that if cooperation was occurring, strings would be pulled faster and reward obtained quicker in such dyads. However, when paired with an experienced bee, demonstrators (n = 16 randomly chosen individuals) took 2.5 times longer to pull the string and obtain the reward (39.9 \u00b1 9 s) than when the same individual demonstrators were paired with an experienced observer who did not interact or interfere with them (15.6 \u00b1 2.1 s; Wilcoxon test, Z 30 = 3.409, p < 0.001). These results suggest that bees do not cooperate to pull the string but in fact hinder each other\u2019s efforts to some degree. \n \n Of particular interest for culture-like phenomena is the question of whether a socially learnt behavior routine persists in the population for longer than the original knowledgeable individual can serve as a demonstrator, so that former observers can themselves become demonstrators. If this is the case, then group-specific behavior routines can at least potentially be retained over biological generations. Our network analysis indeed indicates that the technique spread across sequential sets of learners, whereby some bees that learnt the technique never interacted with the seeded demonstrator. In fact, despite the death of the seeded demonstrator in one of the test colonies (Colony 6) after 58 paired foraging bouts, the technique continued to spread among foragers. Moreover we found that there were up to four sequential learning \u201cgenerations\u201d (as opposed to true biological generations) in two of the three colonies (Fig 5). Learners had string pulling demonstrated to them by up to eight different demonstrators (2.1 \u00b1 0.13), and each demonstrator displayed the technique to 5.3 \u00b1 0.93 learners. Overall, seeded demonstrators displayed eight times more string pulling (119.7 \u00b1 26.5) than the other foragers (14.6 \u00b1 3) (Mann\u2013Whitney, U 68 = 4, p = 0.004) and demonstrated the technique to five times more foragers (19 \u00b1 2.8) than the other foragers (4.2 \u00b1 0.7) (Mann\u2013Whitney, U 36 = 2, p = 0.006). This preponderance of the pretrained demonstrators could be a result of higher motivation simply because they obtained reward with every bout, whereas untrained bees often (in the beginning of the experiment) were unrewarded (i.e., unsuccessful until they were paired with a demonstrator or until they learned to pull the string themselves). \n \n To test whether string pulling was diffused socially, we performed network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA). We used the time-based approach described by Hoppitt et al [49]. The Aikake Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine if string pulling was diffused socially by comparing a social and a nonsocial model for each of the diffusion experiments. We found that for all three experiments, social transmission was more likely than asocial transmission (Table 2). \n \n PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image \n \n larger image TIFF original image Download: Table 2. Results of network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA). The difference between the fit of the nonsocial model and the fit for the social model is denoted by the change in AIC (\u0394AIC). Therefore, positive values indicate a better fit for the social model (p values indicate significance). The social transmission estimate reflects the degree to which social interactions between bees influence the diffusion of string pulling. Positive social transmission estimates that do not cross zero (intervals) indicate significant influence of social interactions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564.t002 \n \n We also analyzed the structure of the social networks using exponential-family random graph modeling [50] and found that for all diffusion experiments as well as the control experiments without a demonstrator bee, the structure of the networks was significantly different from random (see Table 3). This indicates that certain bees were more likely to forage together than other bees. Although this could be interpreted as certain individuals preferentially foraging together, given the open-diffusion paradigm and experimental design (in which bees could not freely distribute themselves in space but were forced through the \u201cbottleneck\u201d of the nest entrance tunnel to the foraging arena), this likely reflects temporal factors such differences in when bees began to forage each day, daily changes in foraging activity across bees, and how long each bee takes to return to foraging from the hive. ||||| Scientists taught bumblebees to pull a string to get a food reward, and then those bees spread the learned technique to others. The groundbreaking study is the first to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills. (Reuters) \n \n The bumblebee brain is puny, at least compared with the massive and fatty organ locked in your skull. At about 0.0002 percent the volume of yours, bee brains are close in size to the seeds stuck on a hamburger bun. Thinking about insect brains in terms of size alone, however, is a trap. The intelligence of sesame-brained bugs should not be underestimated. \n \n A study reported in the journal PLOS Biology on Tuesday, for instance, takes bee smarts in a surprising direction: Scientists from the Queen Mary University of London suggest that the \u201cinsects possess the essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission,\u201d as they wrote in their new paper. It is possible to teach a single bee a new trick, in other words, and a different bee can learn that behavior from her peer. \n \n That ability is not the only ace found up the clever bee\u2019s sleeves. A recent experiment published in the journal Science, for instance, suggested that bees have their own version of optimism, as The Washington Post reported at the end of September. (Unless they were just buzzed on sugar.) Bees are also capable of an intricate form of communication called a waggle dance, with which they signal the location of nearby food. Every 75 milliseconds a waggle lasts, roughly speaking, indicates to other honeybees that a nectar source is an additional 330 feet further from the colony. \n \n \u201cBees have some amazing cognitive abilities,\u201d wrote Clint Perry, a behavioral ecologist at Queen Mary University and an author of the paper, in an email to The Washington Post. They can count, he pointed out, at least up to four. \n \n It has long been understood that some animals can teach their peers to perform new tasks. But the most famous examples involve stereotypically brainy critters, like primates or ravens: Japanese macaques show other monkeys how to wash sweet potatoes in streams. A certain group of chimps knows to fish for insects by prodding termite mounds with sticks, nibbled into brushes for maximum scoopage. \n \n [\u2018Like it\u2019s been nuked\u2019: Millions of bees dead after South Carolina sprays for Zika mosquitoes] \n \n In their paper, the researchers demonstrate for the first time that a new skill can pass from bee to bee. To that end, they had to teach bumblebees to do something strange, a task the insects would not know how to perform in nature. The scientists turned to a \u201ccoiled-string test,\u201d similar to other tests used previously in animal cognition research. \n \n \u201cWe wanted to know whether bees, with a dynamic social structure and the ability to socially learn from each other, might have the basic capacities for cultural transmission of a novel behavior,\u201d Perry said. \u201cAnd this is what we showed.\u201d \n \n During the test, a bee needed to extract a blue disc, hidden beneath a clear Plexiglas table, by tugging on a string attached to the puck. These bees had an incentive. The blue disc mimicked a flower, to which the scientists added a tasty drop of sugar water in its center. \n \n When left to their own devices, however, zero out of 50 bees could figure out how to pull the disc out from under the table. (Given a second chance, two out of 25 managed to figure it out, but they were sluggish tuggers.) \n \n [As bees vanish, bee heists multiply] \n \n So the scientists trained a batch of bees in several steps. First they familiarized the animals with the flower mimic, leaving it out in the open. The researchers then tucked the disc progressively further under the table, until the only way for the bee to reach the sugar water would be to yank on the disc\u2019s string. \n \n The scientists successfully trained 23 of 40 bees. (It took about 5-and-a-quarter hours per bee.) Of the 23 pulling bees, three were selected as demonstrators. The scientists put an untrained bee in a separate cage, and let her watch the demonstrator. Out of these bees, 15 in 25 figured out how to pull on the string. \n \n [Morning Mix Bees from hive of 800,000 kill Arizona landscaper, injure others] \n \n Once trained bees were allowed to interact with their colonies, knowledge of the string-pulling behavior spread. In two colonies, the researchers recorded the pulling behavior at four degrees of social separation. In other words, bee D learned to pull the string from bee C, who learned from bee B, who learned from bee A. \n \n If that is the case, why don\u2019t we see more honey bees dragging strings around the garden? It is not necessarily that insects lack the intelligence, or their undersized brains, wrote Perry\u2019s colleague and co-author Sylvain Alem in an email to The Post. Instead, \u201cthe reason we don\u2019t see string-pulling culture in wild bees and other insects is not lack of ability,\u201d the scientist said, \u201cbut lack of opportunity and adequate challenges.\u201d \n \n The takeaway, to hear the scientists tell it, is that \u201ccultural transmission does not require the high cognitive sophistication specific to humans, nor is it a distinctive feature of humans.\u201d Despite our flashcards and our SAT-prep books, we should not feel special in our ability to learn. \n \n [Bee hotels: One way to help native bees] \n \n This post has been updated.",

Imagine a sesame seed clinging to a burger bun, reports the Washington Post\u2014in other words, it's about 0.0002% the volume of a human brain, as calculated by Science. But that doesn't mean you can't teach a bee a new trick, as behavioral ecologist Clint Perry tells the paper: \"Bees have some amazing cognitive abilities,\" including counting up to at least four. And now he and colleagues from Queen Mary University of London are reporting in the journal Plos Biology that bees can not only learn an entirely new skill to get food but also pass on their knowledge, which is one of the basic aspects of culture. In their study, researchers placed blue discs with sugar water beneath a clear plastic table, just out of reach, but affixed a string to each one that, if tugged, would move it within reach. Out of 110 bumble bees individually introduced to the task, some tugged at the strings before eventually quitting, and only two sorted out how to pull on the string to get the sugar water. However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60% of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells Science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \"culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\" (One type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years.)",

Well, they've finally succeeded. In a study published this week in PLOS Biology, the researchers report that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward, but they can also learn this trick from other bees, even though they have no experience with such a task in nature. The study \"successfully challenges the notion that 'big brains' are necessary' \u2013 Bees may be smart, but they're not so smart as to use their legs to pull strings. That's the upshot of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that involved more than 300 bumblebees. Reporting in the journal Current Biology, researchers say they found that bees learned to pull string by using their legs, rather than their eyes, to see if they were pulling on a blue flower that had been attached to a string. They also found that the bees were able to learn to pull the strings even if they didn't have blue flowers to look at. \"These results may mean \u2013 If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a bumblebee, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out a way to help the creatures master the art of foraging.

To test this, researchers trained 15 bumblebees\u2014including two \"innovators\" who were \"exceptionally explorative\" and \"trying a wide variety of methods\"\u2014to pull strings attached to flowers. Then they released the bees into an arena where they could observe them pulling strings \u2013 If you've ever wanted your bumblebee to learn how to pull a string, you're out of luck. That's the upshot of a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which found that bees don't need to pay attention to the object they're trying to pull in order to do so. Instead, they just need to figure out where the string is and where it's going to be pulled from, according to a press release. And that's not all: The study also found that the bees didn't learn the trick by watching other bees pull the \u2013 If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a bumblebee, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out a way to make the insects smarter. Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they say that by \"contextually enhancing\" the reward\u2014for instance, by putting a string in a different part of a Plexiglas table than where they'd seen it during an observation\u2014bees were able to learn how to see the object in a more effective way. \"This is the first time that we've been able to show that a stimulus plays a role in how \u2013 If you've ever wanted your bees to learn to pull strings, you're in luck: A new study finds that it's not just the bees who learn to do so, but the bees themselves, too. Reporting in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers say that not only does it seem like a natural behavior, but that the bees actually copied it. To test this, they trained three bees in three different colonies to pull a string from a table, which they'd then feed to other bees in order to get their reward. After five minutes, the bees were allowed to leave the \u2013 If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a bumblebee, you're in luck: Scientists say they've figured out a way to help the creatures master the art of foraging. Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers say they trained bees in two British bumblebee colonies to pull a string out of a hole in a tree, then watched as the colonies' foragers learned to do the same. They found that the practice was so effective that the bees in the control colonies continued to learn to pull the string as long as they were allowed to do so, reports New Scientist. \u2013 If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a bumblebee, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences may have the answer. It turns out that bees learn how to behave when they're paired with someone who's been doing the same thing for a while, the Los Angeles Times reports. Researchers studied 419 pairs of bees in which one bee was paired with a demonstrator who pulled a string for a reward, while the other bee and observer bee were separated by just a few inches. The more experience the demonstrator had pulling strings, the more likely the observer bee was to learn to \u2013 If you've ever wanted to know how a bee learned to pull a string, you're in luck. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that bees learn to pull strings when they're paired with another forager who's been doing the same thing for a while. The BBC explains that foragers get a reward if they pull a flower from a table, while observer bees get nothing if they don't pull the flower. But it turns out that when paired with an experienced forager, bees are more likely to pull the string together, according to a press release. \u2013 If you've ever wanted your bees to pull a string for you, you're out of luck. That's the upshot of a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which looked at how bees learn to pull strings. Reporting in the journal Current Biology, they found that foragers\u2014that is, bees that are learning to pull the strings themselves\u2014took 2.5 times longer to get the reward when paired with an experienced forager than when they were paired with a nave forager who hadn't pulled the string at all. \"The results suggest that bees do not \u2013 If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a bumblebee, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences may give you an answer. Researchers found that bees tend to pull each other's strings more often when they're on the same page, a phenomenon known as \"diffusion,\" the Guardian reports. \"We were surprised to find such a high level of social transmission,\" says one of the study's authors, a post at Phys.org states. \"This suggests that social interactions are important for the survival of bumblebee hives.\" The researchers studied bees in three separate experiments \u2013 A study published Tuesday in PLOS Biology makes the case that bees have \"amazing cognitive abilities,\" including the ability to learn new tricks and pass them along, reports the Washington Post. It's the first to show that insects have the \"essential cognitive elements for cultural transmission,\" write the researchers from Queen Mary University of London. That means that a bee can learn a new trick from a friend, and that friend can pass along the learned trick to others. The study focused on bumblebees, but it could have implications for other insect species. \u201cBees have some amazing cognitive abilities,\u201d wrote a behavioral ecologist at Queen Mary in an \u2013 Bees have some \"amazing cognitive abilities,\" a researcher tells the Washington Post, and they've been shown in a new study to be able to pass on new skills to their peers. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows for the first time that a new skill can be passed along from one species to the next. In the study, scientists trained bumblebees to pull a string out of a blue disc that had been placed under a Plexiglas table. When left to their own devices, none of the bees could pull the disc out.

While sources familiar with both Rupert, 82, and Wendi, 44, say they have lived increasingly separate lives, especially in recent months, a precise reason for the split was not apparent. News Corp. is set to divide into two separate companies June 28, though sources say the coming business move was not the primary impetus. \n \n PHOTOS: Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng Through the Years \n \n Another theory floated by several sources is that the marriage was strained by Wendi\u2019s socializing and friendships with a series of men over a number of years, including MySpace co-founder Chris DeWolfe as well as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. A spokesman for the Murdochs declined to comment. A call to Wendi's attorney was not returned. \n \n A New York Times profile in June 2012 noted that Rupert rarely accompanies Wendi to the many charitable functions she attends and that her social circle has grown to include Blair, David Geffen, Bono and Nicole Kidman. \n \n Rumors of a romantic affair with DeWolfe made their way into media reports in 2008, a few years after Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. bought MySpace for $580 million. At the time, both Wendi Murdoch and DeWolfe declined to comment. Wendi was \u201cchief of strategy\u201d for MySpace. \n \n PHOTOS: Hollywood's 16 Biggest Divorces Ever \n \n More recently, there have been hints of a special relationship with Blair, who is said to be a godfather to at least one of Wendi and Rupert's daughters. In an article titled \"Tony Blair and the Murdochs: A Family Affair\" in The Guardian last year, author Michael Wolff described Blair as one of Wendi\u2019s \u201cfirst official social conquests\u201d and suggested that she and Blair had joined forces to \u201chandle\u201d Rupert. Wolfe tweeted in May 2012, \u201cWendi Murdoch and Tony Blair: you heard it here first,\u201d prompting journalist Jacob Weisberg to tweet, \u201cAre you suggesting what I think?\u201d A source close to Blair categorically denies any romantic relationship. \n \n Schmidt, said to be friends with Wendi Murdoch, was mentioned in 2010 press reports as having invested with her in the New York-based startup Art.sy, meant to match art with prospective buyers. He has been estranged from his wife, Wendy, and according to media accounts has been linked to other women. The New York Times questioned Schmidt about such relationships in August 2012. His response: \"I don\u2019t think that is an appropriate question. We don\u2019t comment on that -- rumors.\u201d A Schmidt friend says it's \"doubtful\" the Google exec would be romantically linked to Wendi Murdoch. \n \n PHOTOS: Rupert Murdoch's Family Photos \n \n Rupert Murdoch met Wendi Deng in 1998 when she was an employee of News Corp.'s Star TV in Hong Kong. They married in 1999 and have two daughters, Grace, 11, and Chloe, 9. In recent years, China-born Wendi has played an increasing role in News Corp.'s business in China, as well as producing the Fox Searchlight release Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. Sources say she has acted as an intermediary to Chinese officials for several Hollywood executives. Wendi gained national attention in 2011 when she came to her husband's defense after an assailant attempted to hit him with a pie during a hearing in connection with the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. \n \n The Times reported that the Murdochs were both in New York on Thursday when Rupert filed for divorce in New York State Supreme Court. The filing said that the \u201crelationship between husband and wife has broken down irretrievably.\u201d \n \n Rupert is represented by divorce lawyer Ira E. Garr. Pamela Sloan will represent Wendi. Murdoch\u2019s divorce in 1998 from his second wife, Anna Maria Torv, cost him $1.7 billion, though he and Wendi are said to have a prenuptial agreement. \n \n E-mail: Kim.Masters@thr.com \n \n Twitter: @KimMasters ||||| Is there a bombshell behind Rupert Murdoch\u2019s divorce? A BBC reporter suggests there\u2019s more to come. \n \n The Murdoch divorce is fast turning into the kind of saga that could sell a million newspapers a day, and in the latest bit of pot-stirring, Robert Peston, the BBC's usually sober and buttoned-down financial correspondent, sent out an extraordinary tweet last night: \u201c\u2018Am also told that the undisclosed reasons for Murdoch divorcing Deng are jaw-dropping\u2014& hate myself for wanting to know what they are.\u201d \n \n What could he mean? The incendiary comment is being taken particularly seriously as Peston is said by Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff to be good friends with key Murdoch lieutenant Will Lewis. \n \n Wolff says: \u201cWe can only speculate about what he might mean. However, a year ago, she gave an interview to The New York Times suggesting that they were living independent lives. And Wendi\u2019s emails go through News Corp., so the company surely knows who she is talking to and what she is up to.\u201d \n \n Wolff\u2019s remark chimes with The Daily Beast\u2019s report yesterday that the couple have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for some time. \n \n Wolff, added on his Twitter account: \"I'm hearing the WHY, the big reveal, the scandal details, could come tomorrow.\" \n \n In another tweet he wrote: \u201cMurdoch threatened to do bad things to me (some he did) if I revealed affair w/Wendi started before he left his wife.\u201d \n \n Peston\u2019s tweet, which slyly suggests he has off-the-record info despite its claim of ignorance, has triggered a predictable guessing game on Twitter as punters attempt to unearth the real reasons behind the split. \n \n Here are some of the (nonlibelous) ones: \n \n @asbarboz The reason is money honey. \n \n @woodoo79 Feels like the press all know the \u201cshocking\u201d reason Murdoch divorce is happening but too scared of the News Corps legal cartel to say it. \n \n @PTwalnut How ironic would it be if the reason for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s divorce is that the wife doesn\u2019t listen. \n \n ||||| When Rupert Murdoch in 1998 announced his abrupt separation from Anna Murdoch, his wife of 31 years, almost nobody at the time, including Anna, had any idea, or could reasonably speculate, that Murdoch, then an old 67, might have a girlfriend. \n \n But he did. And his divorce and remarriage, and the effect it had on his children, social life and executives, would shape the next generation of his company \u2013 a romance for our time, as it were. \n \n With the curt, and blistering, announcement of his decision to file for divorce from Wendi Murdoch, the young woman he met when she was 28 and working for Star TV, his company in Hong Kong, another upheaval begins. \n \n It was two summers ago that Wendi burst into the news and transformed her public self from harridan to heroine by, with lightning-fast reflexes, blocking a pie attack on her frail-looking husband in the midst of a difficult testimony in Britain before a committee of parliament investigating the hacking scandal. \n \n This was to many people in the wider Rupert-Wendi orbit an unexpected turnaround. The informed gossip, always pretty granular in detail, had put them on the outs for sometime. She hadn't even diverted from a promotional tour for a movie she'd produced \u2013 until the last minute \u2013 to be in London with her up-against-it husband. \n \n Murdoch had told his oldest son, Lachlan, that he'd concluded that marrying Wendi was a \"mistake\" \u2013 or so Lachlan, along with his siblings never a fan of his father's remarriage, was telling people. And during the many months that I was interviewing Murdoch in 2008 for my book about him, we would sometimes meet on weekend mornings at his apartment where it quite appeared he had not slept the night \u2013 but, rather, had arrived minutes before me with clothes bundled in his briefcase. \n \n Indeed, if you imagined two opposite people, save only for their evident mutual ambition, it might be Rupert and Wendi. \n \n Rupert, the cold, cryptic, scowling, impersonal, rock-hard conservative Australian aristocrat, with his four adult children unable to get over his marriage to the woman 39 years his junior. And Wendi, the energetic, ebullient, social creature, with natural liberal tendencies, whose first job in the US was at a Chinese restaurant and who had given him \u2013 \"from the fridge\", after his prostate cancer \u2013 two young Chinese children (and moved her parents to New York). \n \n And yet, something seemed to work, too. \n \n There was the orange hair dye; the workout regimes; his protestations that he had finally learned how to be a good father; and his new friendship with, gasp, liberals. David Geffen, via Wendi, became one of Rupert's closest confidants. \n \n Certainly, business seemed to energize them. I often heard them, like teenagers in love, talking on the phone \u2013 albeit about business deals and, more than not, from different cities. I even saw them holding hands. \n \n But his children continued to dislike her. Even when they made every effort to tolerate her, it was with clenched teeth. And his mother, who died this past year, always refused to meet Wendi. \n \n For her part, Wendi remained ever-furious with him for not standing up to his children \u2013 which included locking their children out of full participation in the trust that controls all the Murdoch assets. \n \n She led a glamorous social life. In effect, she was the center of the jet set. It followed her: Hollywood, the art world, international super stars. She rejuvenated the jet set. \n \n Rumors about their relationship dogged them. When the LA Times threatened to go public with a supposed story of infidelity, News Corp had lawyers debrief both husband and wife and convinced the paper to kill its story. \n \n Robert Peston, the BBC's financial correspondent, who is said to be a close friend of Will Lewis, a key Murdoch lieutenant, tweeted that the real facts of the break-up are \"jaw-dropping\": \n \n Am also told that undisclosed reasons for Murdoch divorcing Deng are jaw-dropping - & hate myself for wanting to know what they are \u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) June 13, 2013 \n \n We can only speculate about what he might mean. However, a year ago, she gave an interview to the New York Times suggesting that they were living independent lives.

As the Hollywood Reporter notes, Deng's friendships with prominent males from Tony Blair to Eric Schmidt are being poked at (Blair's rep firmly denies the former British PM and Deng \"are having an affair\"). But sources say Deng was surprised to be served with divorce papers, even though she and Murdoch have been growing distant in recent months (and have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for a while, according to the Daily Beast). The BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, (who, the Daily Beast notes, is \"usually sober and buttoned-down\") tweeted last night, \"Am told that undisclosed reasons for Murdoch divorcing Deng are jaw-dropping - & hate myself for wanting to know what they are.\" Writes Newser founder Michael Wolff in the Guardian, \"We can only speculate about what he might mean.\" But, he notes, Peston is close with \"key Murdoch lieutenant\" Will Lewis.

And his divorce and remarriage, and the effect it had on his children, social life and executives, would shape the next generation of his company\u2014a romance for our time, as it were.\" Prokop goes on to speculate that Wendi's refusal to listen to her husband's decision to divorce may have had something to do with it. \"The informed gossip, always pretty granular in detail, had put them on the outs for sometime. She hadn't even diverted from a promotional tour for a movie she'd produced\u2014until the last minute\u2014to be in London with her up-against-it husband. Murdoch had told his oldest son, Lachlan, that he'd concluded that marrying Wendi was a \"mistake.\" And during the many months that I was interviewing Murdoch in 2008 for \u2013 Rupert Murdoch's divorce from wife Wendi Deng is causing all kinds of tongues to wag.

(Associated Press) \n \n At least 15 protesters were arrested by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee police after as many as 150 students gathered at the student union then moved to an administrative building to deliver petitions to the school chancellor. \n \n A woman who was allowed to go inside encouraged protesters to rush the building after she emerged, university spokesman Tom Luljak said. \n \n No serious injuries were reported in the melee that followed. \n \n \"We have no problem with a protest,\" Luljak said. \"We do have a serious problem when individuals decide to become violent.\" \n \n Kas Schwerdtfeger, a national organizer for Milwaukee Students for a Democratic Society, said demonstrators were peaceful but persistent in approaching the hall. \n \n \"What we did was try to assert ourselves peacefully and nonviolently,\" Schwerdtfeger said. \"Police started pushing, shoving, using mace on somewhere around 20 to 25 people.\" \n \n The school was among dozens of nationwide campuses hit with marches, strikes, teach-ins and walkouts in what was billed as the March 4th National Day of Action for Public Education. \n \n Organizers said hundreds of thousands of students, teachers and parents were expected to participate in the nationwide demonstrations. \n \n The steep economic downturn has forced states to slash funding to K-12 schools, community colleges and universities to cope with plummeting tax revenue. \n \n Experts said schools and colleges could face more severe financial trouble over the next few years as they drain federal stimulus money that temporarily prevented widespread layoffs and classroom cuts. \n \n Some university officials said they supported the protests as long as they remained peaceful. \n \n \"My heart and my support are with everybody and anybody who wants to stand up for public education,\" University of California President Mark Yudof said in a statement. \"Public education drives a society's ability to progress and to prosper.\" \n \n In Wisconsin, more than 25,000 students have been put on a waiting list after the state's premier financial aid program ran out of money because of increased demand. \n \n At the University of Illinois, about 200 professors, instructors and graduate faculty marched through campus carrying signs that read \"Furlough Legislators\" _ a reference to recent furloughs and 4 percent pay cuts imposed on thousands of university employees. \n \n The state is $487 million behind on payments to the University of Illinois. State government has a budget deficit of $13 billion. \n \n In Olympia, Wash., a group of about 75 protesters arrived at the Capitol bearing a faux coffin emblazoned with the slogan \"R.I.P. Education.\" \n \n They were later ejected from the state Senate gallery after interrupting a debate with a protest song that followed the tune of \"Amazing Grace.\" \n \n \"I once could eat, but now I find, I can't afford the food,\" they sang. \n \n Several Democratic senators applauded the performance, as security guards escorted the protesters from the building. \n \n In Northern California, rowdy protesters blocked major gates at two universities and smashed the windows of a car. \n \n Protesters at the University of California, Santa Cruz surrounded the car while its uninjured driver was inside. Earlier, demonstrators blocked campus gates. \n \n University provost David Kliger said there were reports of protesters carrying clubs and knives, but Santa Cruz police Capt. Steve Clark could not confirm those reports. No arrests had been made. \n \n An advisory posted on the school Web site urged people to avoid the campus because of safety concerns. \n \n At the University of California, Berkeley, a small group of protesters formed a human chain blocking a main gate to the campus. Later in the day, hundreds gathered for a peaceful rally. \n \n \"We're one of the largest economies in the world, and we can't fund the basics,\" said Mike Scullin, 29, a graduate student in education who plans to become a high school teacher. \"We're throwing away a generation of students by defunding education.\" \n \n At the University of Texas at Austin, about 100 students and staff rallied on campus to protest a 5.4 percent hike in tuition and fees approved by regents a day earlier. Protesters complained the quality of education was taking a backseat to the university's bottom line. \n \n Officials said the tuition hikes, which include another 3.89 percent jump for the fall of 2011, were necessary to avoid cuts in the face of declining endowment payouts and an anticipated cut in state aid. \n \n In Alabama, Broderick Thomas, a 23-year-old Auburn senior, attended an annual higher education rally in Montgomery and said he feels \"it's the moral duty of the state to give back what they promised.\" \n \n However, the chairman of the state Senate education budget committee, Sen. Hank Sanders, D-Selma, curbed the enthusiasm, saying it would be hard to find additional funds for higher education this year. \n \n \"I wish we could give all the money higher education needs,\" Sanders said, as some in the crowd groaned. \"We're having to cut up to $460 million out of the budget the governor recommended.\" \n \n Students, teachers, parents and school employees from across California gathered in Sacramento for a midday rally at the Capitol to urge lawmakers to restore funding to public schools. \n \n Linda Wall, a state Department of Mental Health employee, said she had two children attending Sacramento State University. Hikes in student fees and mandatory furloughs for state workers have strained her budget. \n \n \"Their tuition has taken a big chunk of my paycheck and my paycheck is shrinking, so it's a double whammy,\" Wall said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writers Marcus Wohlsen in San Francisco, Robin Hindery in Sacramento, Calif., David Mercer in Urbana, Ill., April Castro in Austin, Texas, Bob Johnson in Montgomery, Ala., Curt Woodward in Olympia, Wash., and Dinesh Ramde in Milwaukee contributed to this report. ||||| A national day of protests against education funding cuts began Thursday with generally peaceful rallies, walkouts and teach-ins at universities and high schools. But an incident in which demonstrators smashed the windshield of a car trying to enter UC Santa Cruz brought a warning against any other violence. \n \n At Cal State Dominguez Hills in the Carson area, about 50 students gathered in front of the student union with some shouting \"Give My Education Back!\" and carrying signs that proclaimed: \"From Pre-K to Ph.D., Let Me Go to School.\" They played a mock \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d game with stops that included \"graduating in four years with a good education\" and \"getting a 30% fee increase.\" \n \n One of the organizers, Kevin Orantes, 23, a junior majoring in public administration and communications, said he became involved because he was upset about the effects of budget cuts on access to education and wanted to leave a better legacy for his own children. \"Today\u2019s generation is reaping the benefits of sacrifice that generations before had to accomplish, like civil rights and women\u2019s rights,\" Orantes said. \"If we don\u2019t do anything for the next generation, it will all be in vain.\" ||||| (03-05) 12:12 PST SAN FRANCISCO -- Gathering for a series of feisty rallies on college campuses, in civic plazas and in the streets, thousands of protesters lashed out Thursday against the budget cuts and neglect that they say are breaking down the state's public education system. \n \n The historic day of demonstrations in the Bay Area and beyond was largely peaceful, with students and others carrying signs like \"Chop from the top,\" a reference to what they see as puffed-up executive salaries. They chanted, recited poetry and shared personal stories. \n \n But amid an often festive atmosphere, there were also efforts to make more forceful statements during the protests, called the Day of Action to Defend Public Education. \n \n More than 150 protesters were arrested on Interstate 880 in Oakland after using an exit ramp to walk onto the freeway and shut it down for nearly an hour. Many wore black, identified themselves as anarchists and carried a banner that read, \"Occupy everything.\" \n \n The action just before 5 p.m., which backed up rush-hour traffic for miles, came after a peaceful rally at Oakland City Hall. Police in riot gear chased and tackled some demonstrators. One was taken away in an ambulance after falling from the freeway onto a road below, witnesses said. Police said the man was expected to survive. \n \n Schools of all kinds \n \n The I-880 closure came near the end of a day that saw protests organized by students, labor unions, activist groups and others on campuses of all kinds, from elementary schools to UC Berkeley. They ripped state officials, who have cut millions of dollars from education budgets at all levels during the recession. \n \n Hundreds rallied at the state Capitol in Sacramento, where speeches included calls to lower the two-thirds requirement in the Legislature to pass a state budget and to tax oil production and tobacco to fund higher education. \n \n Some students at Oceana High School in Pacifica formed an \"SOS\" on a beach, while in San Francisco more than 50 Commodore Sloat Elementary fifth-graders boarded a Muni bus to the State Building. Each wore a handmade sandwich board sign protesting budget cuts to schools. \n \n Students also rallied in Texas - where a day earlier regents had approved a tuition hike at state universities - as well as in Illinois and Alabama. \n \n Many elected officials, including Gov.

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is recommending that six of 27 national monuments under review by the Trump administration be reduced in size, with changes to several others proposed. \n \n A leaked memo from Zinke to President Donald Trump recommends that two Utah monuments - Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante \u2014 be reduced, along with Nevada's Gold Butte and Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou. \n \n Two marine monuments in the Pacific Ocean also would be reduced under Zinke's memo, which has not been officially released. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memo, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. \n \n Trump ordered the review earlier this year after complaining about improper \"land grabs\" by former presidents, including Barack Obama. \n \n National monument designations add protections for lands revered for their natural beauty and historical significance with the goal of preserving them for future generations. The restrictions aren't as stringent as for national parks, but some policies include limits on mining, timber cutting and recreational activities such as riding off-road vehicles. \n \n The monuments under review were designated by four presidents over the last two decades. Several are about the size of the state of Delaware, including Mojave Trails in California, Grand-Staircase Escalante in Utah and Bears Ears, which is on sacred tribal land. \n \n No other president has tried to eliminate a monument, but some have trimmed and redrawn boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service. \n \n Zinke told The Associated Press last month that unspecified boundary adjustments for some monuments designated over the past four decades will be included in the recommendations submitted to Trump. None of the sites would revert to new ownership, he said, while public access for uses such as hunting, fishing or grazing would be maintained or restored. \n \n He also spoke of protecting tribal interests and historical land grants, pointing to monuments in New Mexico, where Hispanic ranchers have opposed two monuments proclaimed by Obama. \n \n Zinke declined to say whether portions of the monuments would be opened up to oil and gas drilling, mining, logging and other industries for which Trump has advocated. It was not clear from the memo how much energy development would be allowed on the sites recommended for changes, although the memo cites increased public access as a key goal. \n \n A spokeswoman for Zinke referred questions Sunday night to the White House, which did not offer immediate comment. \n \n If Trump adopts the recommendations, it would quiet some of the worst fears of his opponents, who warned that vast public lands and marine areas could be lost to states or private interests. \n \n But significant reductions in the size of the monuments, especially those created by Obama, would mark the latest in a string of actions where Trump has sought to erode his Democratic predecessor's legacy. \n \n The recommendations cap an unprecedented four-month review based on Trump's claim that the century-old Antiquities Act had been misused by past presidents to create oversized monuments that hinder energy development, grazing and other uses. \n \n The review raised alarm among conservationists who said protections could be lost for areas that are home to ancient cliff dwellings, towering sequoia trees, deep canyons and ocean habitats. They've vowed to file lawsuits if Trump attempts any changes that would reduce the size of monuments or rescind their designations. \n \n Zinke had previously announced that no changes would be made at six national monuments \u2014 in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, California, Arizona and Washington. He also said that Bears Ears monument in Utah should be downsized. \n \n In addition to shrinking six monuments, Zinke recommends changes at several other sites, including two national monuments in New Mexico: Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande del Norte. \n \n He also recommended changes to Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine. \n \n Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society, said the recommendations apparently made by Zinke \"represent an unprecedented assault on our parks and public lands\" by the Trump administration. \n \n \"This callous proposal will needlessly punish local, predominantly rural communities that depend on parks and public lands for outdoor recreation, sustainable jobs and economic growth,\" Williams said in a statement. \n \n \"We believe the Trump administration has no legal authority to alter or erase protections for national treasures. If President Trump acts in support of these recommendations, The Wilderness Society will move swiftly to challenge those actions in court,\" Williams said.",

But in the weeks before her shocking passing, fans and experts alike had spoken out about her shrinking frame \u2014 which she had attributed to a dangerous diet \u2014 even warning her that her eating habits could prove fatal. \n \n Geldof\u2019s \u201cworringly skinny\u201d body raised concern during London Fashion Week in February, when she posted Instagram shots of her jaw-droopingly tiny waist and arms on Instagram. Bloggers called the look \u201csuper skinny,\u201d \u201cscary,\u201d and expressed concern for her health. \n \n But it wasn\u2019t the first time that her eating habits had been called into question. Back in 2011, she stunned fans by revealing she often subsisted on only fruit and miso soup for weeks at a time. \n \n PHOTOS: Wasting Away: Peaches Geldof Dropped Nearly 50 Pounds Thanks To Dangerous Diet Before Her Death \n \n \u201cI do juicing,\u201d she told OK! magazine. \u201cYou juice vegetables and then you drink it three times a day. It\u2019s gross. I do it usually for about a month.\u201d \n \n \u201cI have no willpower, but with the juicing, I\u201dm like, \u2018I have to do it because I have to lose this extra ten pounds,'\u201d she said. \n \n PHOTOS: The Life & Times Of Peaches Geldof \n \n \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard,\u201d she explained in another interview. \u201cIf you open any high-fashion magazine, the girls in it are stick-thin and they\u2019ve been airbrushed down to the point where it\u2019s just ludicrousness. I have days when I wake up and think, \u2018I\u2019m so fat.'\u201d \n \n So in addition to her juicing diet, Geldof also reportedly subsisted on miso soup. In one outing to Busaba Eathai Thai restaurant in London in 2011, she reportedly spent more than an hour sipping down one bowl. \n \n PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young \n \n At the time, a spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association announced, \u201cSurviving on fruit is a very dangerous diet. Peaches is at a high risk of electrolyte abnormalities, which could lead to cardiac arrest.

    "document": "Rethinking natural altruism: Simple reciprocal interactions trigger children\u2019s benevolence \n \n Significance This research showed that a very simple reciprocal activity elicited high degrees of altruism in 1- and 2-y-old children (as well as older children), whereas friendly but nonreciprocal activity did not. By doing so, it calls into question the current, dominant claim that young humans are naturally and spontaneously altruistic and that socialization cannot account for their altruistic actions. Beyond their scientific innovation, the findings can have important implications for adult\u2013child interactions. Caregivers may engage in simple reciprocal activities that foster both the enactment of altruism in children and their expectation of altruism from others. \n \n Next Section Abstract A very simple reciprocal activity elicited high degrees of altruism in 1- and 2-y-old children, whereas friendly but nonreciprocal activity yielded little subsequent altruism. In a second study, reciprocity with one adult led 1- and 2-y-olds to provide help to a new person. These results question the current dominant claim that social experiences cannot account for early occurring altruistic behavior. A third study, with preschool-age children, showed that subtle reciprocal cues remain potent elicitors of altruism, whereas a fourth study with preschoolers showed that even a brief reciprocal experience fostered children\u2019s expectation of altruism from others. Collectively, the studies suggest that simple reciprocal interactions are a potent trigger of altruism for young children, and that these interactions lead children to believe that their relationships are characterized by mutual care and commitment. \n \n The 19th-century philosopher Auguste Comte coined the term \u201caltruism\u201d to denote an ethical doctrine that places great value on helping others accomplish their goals (1). Today, the study of altruism is one of the most popular areas of research across the biological and social sciences (2\u21d3\u21d3\u20135). Perhaps one of the most consequential questions in the field of altruism involves illuminating its causes. Why do people help each other? \n \n In recent years, rather than primarily relying on studies with human adults or with animals to understand the roots of altruism, scientists have taken to studying the behavior of young humans. One of the most prominent findings in this area is that 1- and 2-y-olds often provide help to novel individuals (6, 7). These groundbreaking results have been taken as evidence that the capacity for humans to provide help is unlikely to result from \u201cacculturation, parental intervention, or any other form of socialization\u201d (8). \n \n Is it truly the case that social experience has little or no role to play in promoting early helping? In our research, rather than interpreting early occurring helping behavior as indicating natural altruism (8), we tested the hypothesis that helping behavior could result from the values or practices subtly communicated in a social situation (9, 10). \n \n Because research across the biological and social sciences has identified reciprocity as a building block of altruism (11\u21d3\u201313), we tested whether, rather than simply emerging automatically, helping would be evident when specific cues of reciprocity were present in the laboratory situation, but would be displayed at much lower levels when such cues were absent. If this were the case, the research would highlight the sensitivity of young children to subtle social cues that signal the nature of an interaction or relationship and, at the same time, make more plausible the role of social experience in triggering young children\u2019s benevolent actions. \n \n Thus, we proposed that a brief experience with reciprocity (e.g., passing a ball back and forth) could well communicate benevolent values or practices and thereby serve as a trigger of children\u2019s altruism. Indeed, because children may not be used to participating in studies or may be wary of strangers, experimenters typically engage in a \u201cwarm-up\u201d activity that is aimed at acclimating children to the testing room and to the experimenter. Often, these experiences involve simple reciprocal activities, such as rolling a ball back and forth together or playing with the same set of objects in a back-and-forth manner. We note that the researchers who have claimed that social experiences do not account for early occurring helping behavior report such warm-up activities with their young participants in their studies on helping (14, 15). Thus, we believe that prior studies showing high degrees of spontaneous altruism in young children (6\u21d3\u20138) may have actually exposed children to cues of reciprocity and that these cues may be responsible for children\u2019s helping. If we could demonstrate this, we would have evidence for an important claim\u2014that reciprocal experiences engender altruism in quite young humans\u2014and that would license the further suggestion that social histories can be an important trigger of helping behavior. \n \n We present the results of four studies. In study 1, a reciprocal interaction led 1- and 2-y-olds to become far more helpful than a friendly interaction that was not reciprocal. In study 2, the effects of a single reciprocal interaction carried over to affect how much children of this age helped a second person in the situation. In study 3, we asked whether reciprocity remained a potent cue for older (preschool) children and found that reciprocal interactions promoted greater generosity. Finally, study 4, also with preschoolers, suggested that reciprocal interactions trigger an important belief in the mind of a child: the perception of benevolence in that situation. \n \n Previous Section Next Section Study 1 The Stanford University Institutional Review Board approved this study and all parents provided informed consent. Thirty-four 1- and 2-y-olds (M = 2.11 y, SD = 0.58, 17 girls) were randomly assigned in study 1 to a warm-up period that involved either reciprocal play or parallel play. The experimenter began the session by enthusiastically greeting the caregiver and child and bringing out \u201cfun toys\u201d from a bag. Two sets of identical toys existed. In the reciprocal play condition, the experimenter retrieved only one set of toys and engaged reciprocally with the child by taking turns rolling a ball, pushing buttons on a small musical toy, and handing large plastic rings to each other. In the parallel play condition, the experimenter and the child each had his or her own set of toys. Under both conditions the experimenter sat 3 ft away from the child, looked and smiled toward the child\u2019s face every 30 s, and made the same friendly statements about the situation in a playful tone each time that he looked at the child (e.g., \u201cToys are fun!\u201d) After 6 min, the experimenter removed the toys and proceeded to the test phase. In the test trials, taken directly from prior research (6), the experimenter unambiguously needed and desired help to attain four goals: to reach a block, a bottle, a clothespin, and a pencil that were out of reach. Children were given 30 s to help on each trial, as the experimenter continued to reach toward the object. Because there was no interaction between age and condition in predicting helping (P = 0.46), we aggregated across 1- and 2-y-olds. As hypothesized, children in the reciprocal play condition helped on significantly more of the four trials (M = 3.05, SD = 1.51) than children in the parallel play condition [M = 1.23, SD = 1.48, t (32) = 3.55, P = 0.001, d = 1.21, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: 0.76\u20132.79] (Fig. 1A). The low level of helping in the parallel play condition is particularly striking, given the salience of the experimenter\u2019s need for help and given that children had little else to do in that situation. View larger version: Download PPT Fig. 1. Effect of reciprocal play manipulation on helping in study 1 (A) and study 2 (C) and on generosity in study 3 (B). Error bars represent the SEM. Did the experimenter signal something more to the child than the terms of their particular relationship? Did he also signal that the more general norm in the situation was one of benevolence? In study 2, we examined whether the altruism engendered by our reciprocal play procedure could trigger helpfulness toward a second person. If so, we could take this as evidence that the children had become \u201cacculturated\u201d to the altruistic norm of the environment. We also introduced a control condition to clarify whether reciprocal play increases helping or parallel play decreases it. \n \n Previous Section Next Section Study 2 Thirty 1- and 2-y-olds (M = 2.16, SD = 0.48, 13 girls) were randomly assigned in study 2 to one of three conditions. One condition was a control condition in which the child played by herself while the experimenter sat on a nearby chair and talked to the child in the same manner as in the other conditions. The other two conditions were identical to the parallel and reciprocal play conditions in study 1. Following these procedures, the experimenter brought in an assistant who was blind to the condition. When the experimenter left the room, the assistant proceeded to reach toward the objects in the same help-seeking way that the experimenter had done in study 1. Because there was no interaction between age and condition in predicting helping (P = 0.15), we again aggregated across 1- and 2-y-olds. A one-way ANOVA showed an effect of condition: F(2, 27) = 7.64, P = 0.002. As hypothesized, the children in the reciprocal play condition helped the assistant at a significantly higher rate (M = 3.00, SD = 1.63) than children in either the control condition [M = 1.20, SD = 1.47, t (18) = 2.58, P = 0.019, d = 1.16, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: 0.33\u20133.03] or the parallel play condition (M = 0.70, SD = 0.94), t (18) = 3.85, P = 0.001, d = 1.72, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: 1.08\u20133.33. Importantly, the control and parallel play conditions did not differ from one another [t (18) = 0.9, P = 0.37, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: \u22120.54\u20131.62] (Fig. 1C). As such, parallel play did not reduce helping; reciprocal play produced it. How can these effects be explained? One potential answer is that reciprocal experiences made children experience the interaction in a more positive way and that this affective positivity accounted for children\u2019s behavior. To address this possibility, two independent raters (blind to the hypothesis) watched videos of the warm-ups from study 2 and used a 1\u20135 scale to rate the amount of fun that the children had while playing. Specifically, coders were explicitly told that having fun in this situation involved the child engaging with the toys, smiling toward the experimenter or their caregiver, or moving around the play area\u2014all behavioral signs that the children were comfortable and engaged in the situation. Because interrater reliability was high (\u03b1 = 0.91), the scores were averaged. The results showed that children in the parallel and reciprocal play conditions were both above the midpoint (3) in rated fun and did not differ significantly [M = 3.20, SD = 1.13 for the parallel condition; M = 3.90, SD = 1.07 in the reciprocal condition), t (18) = 1.41, P = 0.17, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: \u22120.25\u20131.62]. Importantly, children\u2019s fun did not explain their helping behavior [mediation test (16) 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: \u22120.17\u20131.22]. Relatedly, although children clearly had less fun in the no-treatment control condition (M = 2.80, SD = 1.29) than in the reciprocal play condition [t (18) = 2.07, P = 0.05, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: 0.06\u20132.10], the amount of fun that children had did not explain their helping, mediation test (95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: \u22121.90\u20130.23). As such, a fun differential did not account for the effect of condition. The results of study 2 are meaningful and striking: children in the parallel play condition (and the control condition) tended to stand by and do nothing when a new person needed help\u2014despite the fact that there was little else to do in the situation. By contrast, the children in the reciprocal play condition responded by helping time and time again\u2014despite the fact that this new person had previously done nothing for them and now gave them nothing in return. As such, these patterns contradict the claim that social experiences are not related to helping in 1- and 2-y-old children (8). Our findings may seem inconsistent with another recent finding that 2-y-olds do not seem to help puppets who help them any more than they help puppets who do not help them, which has been interpreted to mean that young toddlers do not use reciprocity as a cue for helping (15). In contrast, our data show that 1- and 2-y-olds are actually capable of using far subtler forms of reciprocity to infer the benevolent norms of the situation. Moreover, it is possible in this past research that a prior warm-up period involving reciprocal play had already primed high levels of altruism. \n \n Previous Section Next Section Study 3 In studies 3 and 4, we turn to somewhat older children to answer a complementary set of questions. Thus far, we have shown that the altruism of 1- and 2-y-olds is most likely to occur when cues of reciprocity have been established. However, it is important for both theoretical and practical reasons to examine whether reciprocity remains a potent cue for older children. If it does, it means that reciprocity is a cue that not only jump-starts early altruism but also continues to promote altruism and, as such, can be capitalized upon for this purpose. Thus, study 3 examined whether a much shorter version of our manipulation could have the same effect on older children on a conceptually similar dependent variable: generosity. Thirty 4-y-olds (M = 4.52 y, SD = 0.26, 14 girls) in this study were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. In the reciprocal play condition, the experimenter and the child rolled a ball back and forth for 1 min. In the parallel play condition, the experimenter gave children a ball to play with while he played with an identical ball. The experimenter\u2019s affect and conversation within the interaction (e.g., \u201cThis is a nice ball!\u201d) was standardized across conditions. After 1 min, an assistant, blind to condition, announced that he was ready to play the \u201creal\u201d game, at which point the experimenter exited the room and the assistant administered the dependent measures. Children were given six opportunities to allocate stickers to themselves and to the (now-absent) experimenter. This measure was directly drawn from a prior study that examined children\u2019s economic behavior (17). In two trials, children had to choose between a (1 to self, 1 to experimenter) allocation and a (1 to self, 0 to experimenter) allocation; in two trials, they chose between a (1, 1) and a (1, 2) allocation; and in two trials they chose between a (1, 1) and a (2, 0) allocation. Because there was no interaction between trial type and condition (P = 0.32), we aggregated across trials to create a composite score of the number of trials in which the child acted generously toward the experimenter. The results showed that children in the reciprocal condition were significantly more generous (M = 3.33, SD = 1.53) than the children in the parallel play condition [M = 1.93, SD = 1.39), t (28) = 2.61, P = 0.014, d = 0.95, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: 0.36\u20132.45] (Fig. 1B). Thus, extending study 1 and 2, study 3 found that reciprocity remained a powerful cue for somewhat older children and that even a short reciprocal interaction could trigger altruism in them. \n \n Previous Section Next Section Study 4 Why did our participants carry out these altruistic actions? We have suggested that reciprocal interactions establish a norm of benevolence, but we have yet to show that children view it as a two-way street. In study 4, following up on our study of preschoolers, we ask: Does a brief period of reciprocal play create the expectation of benevolence? If so, we would have identified an important source of a child\u2019s belief in a foundational aspect of social reality: the extent to which others can be expected to be benevolent. Twenty 4-y-olds (M = 4.40 y, SD = 0.35, 12 girls) in this study were brought by an experimenter to a testing room. Once there, the experimenter asked two assistants if they could play with the child while he, the experimenter, carried out another task before playing the \u201creal\u201d game. Once children assented to playing with these new people, the experimenter, to remain blind to the children\u2019s experience, turned away for the remainder of the play session. Next, one assistant sat in front of the child for one uninterrupted minute and engaged in either reciprocal or parallel play (counterbalanced); then the second assistant engaged in the other form of play for a second uninterrupted minute. As in study 3, the reciprocal play involved rolling a ball back and forth with the child, and the parallel play involved giving the child a ball and playing with another ball. Each assistant emoted and spoke in the same way during the interaction (e.g., \u201cThis is a nice ball!\u201d) After 2 min, the assistants left the room and the experimenter turned toward the child and showed him or her pictures of the two assistants. Using a forced-choice procedure, children were asked to point to the person whom they thought would give them a gift, help them open a door, and share a toy with them. The results showed that children chose the reciprocal interaction partner over the parallel partner as the one who would engage benevolently at a level significantly higher than chance [an average of 2.15 of the three trials; one-sample t test against chance value of 1.50, t (19) = 3.90, P = 0.001, 95% C.I. with 5,000 bootstrap samples: 0.35\u20130.95]. \n \n Previous Section Next Section Discussion We began our investigation by examining whether a simple experience with reciprocity might serve as a critical cue for altruism. We found support for this contention. Reciprocal interactions triggered high levels of altruistic behavior on the part of 1- and 2-y-olds whereas parallel play did not. Moreover, we found this with an age group in which altruism had been depicted as occurring naturally and without much need for social input (8). We further found that an even shorter reciprocal interaction elicited substantially more altruism than a parallel interaction in preschoolers and that these interactions yielded not only the enactment of altruism but the expectation of it from others. Thus, consistent with anthropological (18, 19), economic (20, 21), evolutionary (22, 23), philosophical (24), psychological (25\u21d3\u201327), and sociological (28, 29) theories of human contractual processes, our young participants were, in a sense, capable of drawing broad inferences about the benevolent norm of the situation on the basis of reciprocal patterns of behavior. It is interesting to note that although prior research has shown that explicitly rewarding or encouraging helping seems to lower it (30, 31), in none of our studies did we directly model, teach, or reward altruistic actions for children. Rather, we exposed children to certain cues about the local \u201cculture.\u201d In the parallel play condition, children may have learned that, in this culture, people engage with each other by carrying out their own activities. By contrast, in the reciprocal play condition, they may have learned that people engage with each other by being responsive to each other\u2019s needs. As such, our findings build on past research showing that infants\u2019 helping may be triggered by actions that people carry out, such as intentionally providing toys to the infant (32). However, it is important to note that the experimenter in our studies provided toys in both the reciprocal and the parallel play conditions. What varied across the conditions was whether the experimenter and the child engaged reciprocally, not whether the experimenter showed an intention to provide. Our research also builds on past research showing that preschoolers understand the principle of economic reciprocity and use it to guide their decisions about what others should do (33). Our findings suggest that children will be more likely to act on the principle of economic reciprocity if they have themselves undergone even a simple reciprocal interaction. More generally, and consistent with research that shows that children are avid learners who eagerly look for clues about how the physical world operates (34, 35), our data build on theories of children\u2019s social learning (36, 37) by documenting that reciprocal interactions trigger the enactment and expectation of altruism in young children. That is, after an experience with reciprocity, children seem to construct a community characterized by care and commitment. Thus, the notion that socialization has little or no part to play in early occurring altruism (8) becomes less plausible. Experimenters, parents, teachers, and others who regularly interact reciprocally with children may be implicitly communicating to children that in these contexts people help one another. Fortunately, children seem quite eager to adopt this \u201cbenevolent social contract.\u201d \n \n Previous Section Next Section Acknowledgments We thank Ellen Markman, Hazel Markus, Peter Belmi, Michael Hahn, and Takuya Sawaoka for their generous and insightful commentary; two reviewers for their helpful feedback; Meha Bakshi, Mona Matsumoto-Ryan, Kirk Holstrom, Miguel Patino, Christine Liu, Larry Liu, Thomas Farleigh, Stephanie Lim, Zachary Peters, Erick Campos, Ronald Anderson, and Sarah Jobalia for assistance; and above all, the children and caregivers who eagerly and benevolently participated in this research.

Now, a pair of Stanford psychologists has conducted experiments that indicate altruism has environmental triggers, and is not something we are simply born with. \n \n In 2006, a study involving toddlers found that the 18-month-olds were willing to provide a helping hand to the experimenters without being prompted. This expression of altruistic behavior in such young children aligned with what many scientists believed to be an expression of innate altruism, and the findings have served as the basis for dozens of studies since. \n \n Rodolfo Cortes Barragan, a psychology graduate student at Stanford, and Carol Dweck, the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology, suspected there might be more to the story. As with most experiments involving toddlers, the researchers behind the 2006 study engaged in a few minutes of play with the children, in order to make them comfortable with new people in a new setting. \n \n But this interaction, however brief, might have primed the toddler subjects toward altruistic behavior, and affected the outcome of the experiment. \n \n \"Kids are always on the lookout for social cues, and this is a very prominent one,\" said Barragan, the lead author on the research paper. \"Does the person's play indicate that they'll care for me? These actions communicate a mutuality, and the child responds in kind.\" \n \n Barragan and Dweck designed a novel experiment to isolate the effect of the pretest warm-up period. They enlisted 34 one- and two-year-olds and split them into two groups. In the first group, the experimenter would roll a ball back and forth with the child and chat. After a few minutes, the experimenter would \"accidentally\" knock an object off the table, and observe whether the child would help pick it up, exactly as in the 2006 study. \n \n The difference was in the second group. Here, the experimenter and the child would each play with their own ball, known as \"parallel play,\" while the experimenter engaged in the same kind of chitchat. Again, after a few minutes, the experimenter would knock an object off the table. \n \n The children who engaged in reciprocal play were three times more likely to help pick up the items as the children who had engaged in only parallel play. When the scientists repeated the experiment under slightly different conditions with older children, the reciprocal-play group was two times more likely to lend a hand. \n \n The results suggest that altruistic behavior may be governed more by relationships, even brief ones, than instincts. \n \n \"I think the findings will stir up some controversy, but in a good way,\" Dweck said. \"People often call something 'innate' because they don't understand the kinds of subtle experiences that can make something, like altruism, flourish. Rodolfo has discovered a really subtle experience that has a powerful influence.\" \n \n One of the arguments for innate altruism was that it was an evolutionarily beneficial adaptation \u2013 instinctively caring for others would result in reciprocal care, improving one's own chances of survival. And there might still be evolutionary pressures toward altruism, Dweck said. We have evolved automatic forms of empathy and special brain cells called mirror neurons that allow us to gauge others' emotions. \n \n \"I think, as humans, our claim to fame is our flexibility \u2013 our ability to adapt to new situations,\" Dweck said. \n \n The researchers said that more studies are needed to verify the findings, particularly in children younger than 18 months. For now, though, the results suggest that social and developmental psychologists might need to revisit the influence of some of the everyday experimental methods common in research. \n \n The findings also hint at the greater positive impact that might come from reciprocal interactions at a very young age. \n \n \"Following the reciprocal play, children felt a sense of trust in the other person,\" Barragan said. \"If children trust the people in their world, they may have an easier time learning the culture of that world \u2013 effectively making it easier for them to achieve new levels of personal and interpersonal success.\" \n \n The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n Media Contact \n \n Bjorn Carey, Stanford News Service: (650) 725-1944; bccarey@stanford.edu \n \n Carol Dweck, Psychology: dweck@stanford.edu \n \n Rodolfo Cortes Barragan: cortes@stanford.edu ||||| Photo: James Peragine/Getty Images \n \n From the moment they\u2019re born, parents lavish praise their little ones. \u201cWhat an angel,\u201d they say. \u201cAw, she\u2019s so sweet.\u201d But it turns out, children may not be born nice at all. \n \n According to a new study published in the November issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the practice of altruism isn\u2019t innate; it\u2019s influenced by environmental factors. \n \n \n \n STORY: How to Teach Gratitude \n \n \n \n \"I think the findings will stir up some controversy, but in a good way,\" lead study author Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford University said in a press release. \u201dPeople often call something \u2018innate\u2019 because they don\u2019t understand the kinds of subtle experiences that can make something, like altruism, flourish.\u201d \n \n \n \n STORY: Preschoolers and Sleep: What Parents Should Know \n \n \n \n Dweck and her partner, psychology graduate student Rodolfo Cortes Barragan, were skeptical of a 2006 study of 18-month-old kids which found they were willing to help without being prompted \u2013 so they revamped the experiment. \n \n \n \n They split a group of 34 children, ages one and two, into different groups. In the first group (which mimicked the 2006 study), a researcher rolled a ball back and forth with a child while chatting. The adult then knocked over an object and watched to see whether the kid picked it up. In the second group, a researcher and child each played with a ball on their own (\u201cparallel play\u201d), while talking. The adult also knocked over an object. \n \n The results: Children who took part in the reciprocal, back-and-forth play were three times more likely to pick up the fallen item as kids who engaged in parallel play. That bit of interaction may have primed the toddlers to help out, the researchers concluded. \n \n \u201cKids are always on the lookout for social cues, and this is a very prominent one,\u201d Barragan said in the press release. \u201cDoes the person\u2019s play indicate that they\u2019ll care for me?

In the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that the more a child played with another child, the more likely the child was to offer help to that child. In one experiment, for example, a 2-year-old played with a 1-year- old, rolling a ball back and forth as if they were playing with a ball of their own.

Simpson. \n \n \"I really don't know what to think of it,\" Clark tells ET exclusively. \"I can't believe someone gave a police officer what appears to be, could be, important evidence in a case -- even if it is closed -- and takes it home. I don't know what to say about that except I can't believe it, but it's apparently what happened.\" \n \n Of course, she still remains skeptical. \n \n \"I don't know whether to say it is truly evidence, none of us knows that yet -- it might be a hoax, it might be somebody who planted it and then just pretended to find it and gave it to the off-duty police officer, you don't know,\" Clark says. \"But, of course, I'm glad the LAPD is taking it seriously and subjecting it to testing so we can find out.\" \n \n Clark notes that DNA evidence could still be potentially recovered from the knife, if it is indeed not a hoax. \n \n \"It's very possible -- I mean, they recover DNA on mummies in Egypt,\" Clark says. \"It's entirely possible that if there is some DNA to be recovered, that it could be found, especially with today's technology, which is much more sensitive.\" \n \n \"I think it's a remarkable development if it does turn out to be connected to the murders of Ron and Nicole,\" she adds. \"It would be interesting if there was some evidence on that knife that pointed to who might have helped to bury it, if indeed someone else did.\" \n \n Though Clark points out that the chances of this leading to any sort of prosecution is unlikely. \n \n \"The likelihood of any prosecution stemming from this evidence is very, very slim,\" she admits. \"But we have to find out what this means -- what the truth of this is.\" \n \n \"I just hope the truth comes out about this situation, as I always do about all situations -- whatever this is, let's find out,\" she adds. \"Let's find out if it's related or not. I really want to say -- my heart goes out to the families. With these kind of things that stir up all these memories and the pain of it all, I just can't imagine how they're feeling right now.\" \n \n In a press conference on Friday morning, LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman confirmed that the department is investigating the alleged discovery of a knife on the Rockingham property formerly owned by Simpson. He declined to name the retired officer involved in the discovery of the knife, although according to the Los Angeles Times , a construction worker found the knife years ago and turned it over to the police officer in question. \n \n According to TMZ, the officer informed Robbery Homicide detectives of the knife's existence because he wanted to get it framed. \n \n Clark, 62, was the head prosecutor during Simpson's trial, and ended up taking a leave of absence from her job after the former NFL star was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1995. Clark retired two years later, but went on to co-author a book about the case titled Without a Doubt. \n \n Simpson, 68, remains in a Nevada state prison after he was arrested in connection with a robbery at a Las Vegas hotel room in September 2007. He was found guilty on 12 counts, including kidnapping and armed robbery, in October 2008, and was later sentenced to 33 years in jail. Simpson is still eligible for parole in November of 2017 -- at the age of 70 -- his lawyer, Ozzie Fumo, tells ET, unless he receives a sentence reduction through other means. \n \n On Friday, Neiman said that it is his understanding that could Simpson could not be retried on murder charges, as he was previously acquitted. \n \n \"I think the series actually makes an effort to acknowledge them and the ways in which that they were forgotten,\" Clark said. \"This is an important series that's beautifully done, very compelling and I can't thank Ryan Murphy enough for what he's done here in terms of raising these issues in a very serious and compelling and very substantive way.\" \n \n \"But at the end of the day, two people lost their lives in a brutal murder,\" she added. \"So we have to remember that. We can't forget them again. Remember Ron and Nicole.\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Simpson Murder Case: Buck Knife Could Produce Ron and Nicole's Fatal Wounds \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n The knife found buried on O.J. Simpson's former estate was more than capable of inflicting the mortal wounds on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman ... so says the man who examined the wounds of the victims. \n \n Dr. Irwin Golden, who served as the Deputy Medical Examiner, testified in the O.J. Simpson case and performed both autopsies, tells TMZ the folding buck knife could have severely cut both victims. Nicole was brutally attacked with a deep neck wound -- 2 1/2 inches deep and 5 1/2 inches across -- and Golden says a 4\" blade could have done the deed. We broke the story ... the knife in question has a 5\" blade. \n \n Sources connected with the 1994 investigation and others involved in the evaluation of the knife tell us there was always a wide belief among LAPD cops that Simpson used a buck knife. \n \n TMZ broke the story ... a construction worker found the knife buried on the perimeter of the property in 2002, gave it to a retired LAPD cop who never turned it in, instead taking it home and putting it in his tool box. The cop claims he alerted LAPD when he got it, but they expressed no interest. \n \n Dr. Golden cautioned if the murder weapon was a buck knife it had to be \"heavy.\" A knife expert tells us back in '94 buck knives were made with heavy American-made steel. \n \n The knife is being tested for fingerprints and hair. Next week it goes to the serology unit for DNA testing. ||||| A buried knife was found at O. J. Simpson's estate during construction work, though no one is sure exactly when, TMZ reports. Though the construction worker gave it to a nearby police officer, that cop chose to keep the knife at his own house \u2014 and did so for years. It didn't come to official attention until the officer retired and asked a fellow cop for the case number for the Simpson case; he wanted to engrave it on his grim keepsake. The second cop reported the first to superiors, and the knife was turned over to the police forensics experts. It is currently being tested for hair and fingerprints, TMZ says, though those tests may not be of much use. It's hard to know, after so many years, how much forensics experts will be able to find. \n \n Simpson can't be tried again Over the years, several knives have been proposed as the murder weapon \u2014 the knife that killed Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman \u2014 though none conclusively. This may not be the right knife, either. The knife found on the Simpson property is \"a relatively inexpensive, smaller-bladed utility blade typically carried and used by construction workers, gardeners, landscapers or other laborers,\" NBC reports. Still, the knife must be tested to definitively rule it out. \n \n Even assuming evidence is found linking the knife to the slayings, its discovery is mostly a symbolic event. There's no double jeopardy \u2014 even if the knife has Simpson's DNA, or that of the murder victims, Simpson can't be tried again. But this is assuming any evidence will be found on the knife, and that's not a sure thing. \n \n Let's start with fingerprints, though there's no guarantee any will be found. People don't always leave fingerprints, even if they've touched an object, according to the South Dakota Department of Criminal Investigation. There's also no way to know how long a fingerprint will last \u2014 sometimes fingerprints are found on surfaces that haven't been touched in decades, but they're sometimes lost on objects touched recently. And fingerprint residue can be wiped away through cleaning. If the officer who had the knife cleaned it, fingerprint evidence is likely lost. \n \n Samples may have been contaminated through the years Hair is a little trickier. The part of your hair that sticks out of your head doesn't contain nuclear DNA \u2014 only the bulb, which produces the hair, does, according to Forensics Magazine. If the bulb is there, though, it may have been contaminated through the years, and time, as well as the environment, may have degraded it \u2014 making a single source profile difficult, says Susan Walsh, a forensics professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, in an email. \n \n That doesn't mean it's impossible to obtain DNA from the hair shaft, though. There may be mitochondrial DNA, which can provide information about the mother of the person who produced the hair \u2014 though that's not as useful as a typical nuclear DNA profile, says Walsh. \n \n Regardless of the type of DNA forensics experts are trying to work with, it's possible the sample was degraded or contaminated over the years. For instance, if the knife was in a damp environment, that makes it likelier that the DNA won't be useful, says Graciela Cabana, an expert in ancient DNA at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Every environment has contaminants, so it's important that DNA from the sample be in good shape, otherwise, the contaminants can drown out important information. \"Was the knife in an evidence bag?\" she writes in an email. \"If not, I wouldn't trust any evidence on it.\" \n \n \"Was the knife in an evidence bag?\" A major question for any kind of forensic analysis is how the knife was handled, and what has happened to it since it was discovered. If it was handled by people not wearing gloves, they probably introduced contaminants, says Cassandra Kuba, a professor of anthropology at the California University of Pennsylvania. Mishandling the knife may mean fingerprints rubbed off, and adds to the likelihood there's contaminant DNA. \n \n But it may be possible to rule out some contaminants \u2014 DNA samples from the construction worker who originally found it and from the cop whose possession it was in could help eliminate any contamination from them. Samples from the environment it was found in could also help scientists eliminate additional irrelevant DNA. \"We have gotten DNA from buried items, there is really no way to tell which ones will give you meaningful DNA until you test,\" says Greg Hampikian, director of the Idaho Innocence Project. \"Questions about possible contamination are really premature until we see what is recovered from the knife.\" \n \n A little bit of background for the '90s babies: O. J. Simpson was a tremendously popular football player in the 1970s who parlayed his retirement into an acting career in the 1980s (he's in The Naked Gun, for instance). In June 1994, Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered, along with Ronald L. Goldman; their wounds indicated a knife, but no weapon was ever found. After leading police on a low-speed chase in his iconic white Ford Bronco, Simpson was arrested and stood trial for the murders. Without the knife, prosecutors relied on a blood-soaked glove \u2014 and that wasn't enough to convince a jury. Simpson was acquitted. He is now in prison for armed robbery; he was found guilty of that crime in 2008. \n \n Correction: A previous version of this article characterized O.J. Simpson's police chase as \"high-speed.\" It wasn't; he was driving slowly, but with a gun to his head so that police wouldn't approach.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Yesterday felt like 1994 all over again, with OJ Simpson grabbing headlines across America after TMZ broke the news that the LAPD is testing a knife that was allegedly found nearly two decades ago on Simpson's former estate. More comments and context as the dust settles: The Los Angeles Times spoke with Mike Weber, whose Weber-Madgwick Inc. construction company demolished the Brentwood mansion in 1998. \"I think it's a joke. No one on my crew found anything. I had instructed my people, 'If you find anything, don't keep it,'\" he said, though he does concede, \"Hundreds and hundreds of people were there after me.\" TMZ keeps its story going by speaking to Dr. Irwin Golden, the Deputy Medical Examiner who examined Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman's bodies. He believes a knife with a 4-inch blade could have been the murder weapon; the newly found knife has a 5-inch blade. NBC News' report throws plenty of water on the story. Its law enforcement sources tell it the knife is not consistent with the murder weapon but is akin to a small utility knife a gardener might carry, was given to now-retired LAPD officer in 2001 or 2002, and didn't have the appearance of having long-been buried. Former prosecutor Marcia Clark weighed in, too, with comments to Entertainment Tonight. \"It might be a hoax ... but, of course, I'm glad the LAPD is taking it seriously and subjecting it to testing so we can find out.\" As far as those tests go, The Verge explains exactly how the forensic analysis will be carried out. And should the knife actually check out? The Washington Post asks and answers a slew of \"tricky legal questions.\" Read more on the newly found knife here.",

    "document": "No one can predict when the current bull market will end. But we can all agree on when began, right? \n \n \n \n You might think so, but no. \n \n \n \n By the most commonly accepted definition, the bull market in stocks that followed the 'Great Recession' and global financial crisis turns eight years old Thursday. On Monday, March 9, 2009, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed at 676, having touched 666 the prior Friday, and then reversed higher. \n \n By the standard custom for classifying bull and bear markets, this rebound became a new bull market once it gained 20 percent \u2013 just two weeks later. And those unwritten rules say that this bull market remains in force unless and until the S&P declines at least 20 percent from a high. \n \n That has not happened since March 2009, which is why this 250-percent advance is still generally considered one, long bull market \u2013 the second-longest ever, in fact. \n \n Yet plenty of professional investors and longtime students of the market argue that dating the bull market to the initial snap-back rally from a 12-year low overlooks some of the setbacks since then and perhaps overstates the bull's age. \n \n Here are some alternative start dates commonly cited by those who think the bull market truly got rolling well after the tumultuous swings around the financial-crisis climax: \n \n Source: CNBC \n \n September 2011: In a sort of financial-crisis aftershock, stress in European debt markets, surging oil prices and a U.S. debt-ceiling standoff struck a still-fragile economic recovery and dragged the S&P 500 down 19.4 percent from May to September that year. The decline exceeded 20 percent on an intraday basis and most global indexes suffered declines of at least that much. \n \n The record keepers file this under the heading of \"severe market correction,\" but to many it was close enough to consider the recovery from the September 2011 akin to a new, or renewed, bull market. \n \n March 2013: In some respects, this equity advance didn't begin to behave as a real bull market until late 2012. Treasury yields had bottomed in mid-2012, and riskier assets benefited from the unclenching of tensions that this represented. Risk spreads on speculative high-yield debt began collapsing, and for the first time in this economic cycle, the price-earnings multiple on stocks began expanding. \n \n By early 2013, with Washington gridlocked, the Federal Reserve looking to end quantitative easing and equities appearing cheap relative to bonds, the S&P gained upward momentum. By late March 2013, the index finally eclipsed its former all-time high from October 2007 of 1565. \n \n \n \n Some strategists say this was the end of the \"secular bear market\" that had begun in the year 2000 and the start of a new \"secular bull market.\" The term \"secular\" refers to a long-term structural move in asset prices. An earlier secular bear lasted from 1966 to 1982, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was contained below the 1000 market, followed by the stupendous secular bull of 1982 to 2000. \n \n Obviously within these periods are significant cyclical swings, often of more than 20 percent against the long-term trend. \n \n There's no real science to defining or playing such periods. And, frankly, there have been so few that it's hard to generalize about their behavior with too much confidence. \n \n But the idea that a push to a new all-time high touches off a decade-plus of further upward movement has some evidence behind it, and the likes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been using this framework since the 2013 breakout. \n \n February 2016: The S&P 500 fell \"only\" about 15 percent from the summer of 2015 to the early-2016 low as oil prices collapsed and global recession and deflation fears flared. \n \n \n \n Yet that understates the carnage beneath the surface. The small-cap Russell 2000 sank 26 percent over eight months. And Strategas Research technical strategist Chris Verrone notes that 63 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 index fell at least 20 percent from their 52-week high. \n \n So, bear market or not, it was a pretty good washout - one that many now argue cleansed the market of excesses, rebuilt value and reinvigorated the bull. In some ways this is akin to the Asian financial crisis of 1998, when the S&P 500 never fell by more than 20 percent but 70 percent of all stocks did. Once it bottomed, that bull market put in a ferociously lucrative final push over the next 18 months. \n \n So how much does this matter for an investor trying to set expectations for future equity performance? \n \n Not terribly much. Even if we say the bull is eight years old, and therefore a \"mature\" one, bull markets don't die of old age; they are put down by recession, financial panic or the Fed. \n \n \n \n On the other hand, even if we decree that the bull market truly started five-and-a-half years, or four years ago, or 13 months ago, it doesn't change the fact that stock valuations are close to the top of their historical range and the eight-year returns delivered by the market are among the best ever. \n \n Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial looked back at all eight-year periods since 1936. The past eight years' gain was only exceeded 35 times, placing the current run in the top four percent of all past periods. Most prior instances occurred in clusters in the mid-1950s, and then the late-'90s and early 2000. \n \n The one-, five- and ten-year average and median returns following the other such periods aren't great \u2013 small losses one year out and subpar appreciation for longer periods. \n \n Granted, those averages are heavily undercut by the Tech Bubble readings. But taken together, they suggest that no matter when you say the bull market began, it's certainly not over but it's probably not early. \n \n ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - The run of gains on Wall Street turns 8 years old on Thursday and, despite its advanced age, is expected to rage on, with perhaps a few hiccups, based on a combination of stronger company earnings, lower taxes and a corporate-friendly administration in Washington. \n \n A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 6, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \n \n Strategists, however, warn that a correction of as much as 10 percent should be expected as the market is richly valued. The bull case for equities relies on analysts seeing little chance of recession in the short term. \n \n \u201cJust because the (bull) market has hit a birthday, or is among the longest ever, doesn\u2019t mean that it will \u2018die\u2019 of old age,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \n \n \u201cMarkets don\u2019t really pay attention to the calendar or the candles on the cake.\u201d \n \n The S&P 500 index has rallied 250 percent since hitting a closing low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009. The gains since, uninterrupted by a decline of 20 percent or more, rank this bull market as the second longest ever. \n \n The current run is nearly three years older than the average bull and more than a year shorter than the longest one: the rally from Oct. 11, 1990 to March 24, 2000. \n \n The S&P continued to rise through a year-long decline in corporate earnings through most of 2016, supported in part by historically low interest rates which made stocks comparatively cheaper and more rewarding than U.S. Treasuries. \n \n The index has risen nearly 6 percent in 2017, closing on Wednesday at 2,362.98. Analysts remain undeterred in their belief that more gains are coming as the economy and corporate earnings growth improve. \n \n \"With earnings growth expected to continue the rest of the year, it might be a rocky road but it could still be that the bull market makes it to nine,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. \n \n Infographic ID: '2n9BKfK' \n \n A Reuters poll in December showed analysts expected the S&P 500 to finish 2017 at 2,350, buoyed by the belief that President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to stimulate the economy with infrastructure spending, lower taxes and financial deregulation would come to pass. \n \n Strategists, including some with a lower target than that, see the bull market continuing, even if a correction is in the cards. \n \n Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS Securities, said he expects a pullback of 5 to 10 percent to \u201crefresh\u201d the bull market and that such a correction would be a buying opportunity. \n \n \u201cThe bull market is going to finish, in our view, when conditions begin to accumulate that tend to lead to a recession. We just don\u2019t see that as a 2017 or 2018 event,\u201d Emanuel said. \n \n He warned, however, that \u201cvaluations have outrun earnings potential and the state of fundamentals generally.\u201d \n \n With the S&P 500 currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, well above its average of 15, corporate profits will need to improve in order to bring down valuations. \n \n Earnings are seen growing 10.7 percent this year compared to last, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Even though that is a lower expectation than the 12.5 percent estimate at the start of January, it still allows for a healthy gain in 2017. \n \n U.S. economic data, including a private sector jobs report on Wednesday that showed growth recorded its biggest increase in more than a year in February, continues to improve and is far from indicating a downturn, further supporting stock prices. \n \n \u201cWe do not yet see any of the warning signs that point to a larger decline,\u201d said Kingsview\u2019s Nolte, who sees a pullback of up to 5 percent. \u201cA recession does not seem to be in the cards just yet.\u201d ||||| 8 Things to Know about the Bull Market on Its 8th Birthday \n \n The stock market has accomplished something that only one other bull market in history has achieved \u2014 it survived to see its eighth birthday. \n \n It was eight years ago today that the Dow Jones industrial average sank to its recent nadir of 6,547, as hundreds of thousands of workers were losing jobs and the global financial system teetered on the edge of collapse. \n \n Since then, though, the Dow has skyrocketed more than 14,000 points to 20,855. The broader S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks has come roaring back too, returning an annual 20% to investors who had the nerve to stay in the scary market. \n \n But this was by no means a straight shot back up. In fact, the second-longest bull market in the post-World War II era has been unpredictable, puzzling, and rather peculiar. \n \n Here's how: \n \n 1. This Bull Has Been Unloved \n \n \"The current bull market has been the least loved, the most questioned and the most doubted bull that we certainly can recall in near 34 years of experience in the markets,\" noted Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus in a recent report. \n \n That's an understatement. \n \n Even as this bull market more than tripled the value of stocks over the past eight years, the percent of households that actually own equities has sunk from 62% in 2008 to 52% last year, according to a survey by Gallup . \n \n That's the lowest level of stock ownership in the 19 years that Gallup has been tracking this data. \n \n 2. This Bull Has Been Persistent \n \n World events since 2009 have been anything but supportive for a major stock market rally. Major industries such as banks and automakers neared collapse. The Federal government shutdown for 16 days. And political posturing in Congress in the Obama years brought the nation close to defaulting on the national debt. \n \n Overseas, major European nations were crippled by a debt crisis, terrorists attacks spread around the globe, and China's economy endured a dramatic slump. \n \n Yet stocks kept chugging along. \n \n 3. This Bull Was Nearly Gored Last Year \n \n Since President Trump's election in November, the stock market has been on a a roll, as most major economic metrics have been pointing higher. So it's easy to forget that as recently as a year ago, there was real doubt that equities would make it to this anniversary. \n \n One year ago stocks were battered by a series of bad headlines, such as low growth in China and weak global demand for oil. A few months later U.K. voters decided to leave the European Union, and eventually Donald Trump was elected president \u2014 a plot twist that some analysts predicted would cause stocks to crash. \n \n And yet stocks rebounded from their disastrous 2016 winter to deliver 22% over the past 12 months, according to CFRA, the third biggest year-over-year gain since March 2009. \n \n 4. This Bull Has Been Surprisingly Calm \n \n Despite all of last year's uncertainty, stocks have been remarkably subdued. In fact, compared to the bull market of October 1990 to March 2000, investors could afford to take a long, deep breath for the past 12 months. \n \n \"During year eight, the S&P 500 recorded 85 [days of more than 1% gains or losses] in 1998, but only 23 in the year just past,\" according to CFRA's Sam Stovall. \n \n 5. This Bull Is Getting Expensive \n \n \" Most importantly for investors, both stocks and bonds are now significantly more expensive than eight years ago,\" says David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds. \n \n The current price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 now rests at 18 based on projected profits over the coming 12 months. That's about 12% above the market's 25-year average, per Kelly. That could be a result of investors hoping that a GOP-dominated federal government will unleash billions in tax cuts and spending to jumpstart persistently lackluster post-recession economic growth. \n \n By another P/E calculation, the market is even frothier. Based on 10 years of averaged corporate profits, the stock market's P/E now stands at 29.8. The only other times the market has been this expensive by this measure was during the dot.com bubble and the Great Depression. \n \n 6. This Bull Is Egalitarian \n \n Different sectors of the market have experienced their own highs and lows. Financial stocks, for instance, gained 149% from March 2009 - 2010, according to CFRA, but fell 9.5% two years later, before leading the pack last year. \n \n Two years ago sleepy, defensive-minded utility stocks earned investors the best return (14.8%), while energy companies lost big league (-16.2%). \n \n These rough edges, though, have smoothed out over the long haul. From 2009 to 2017, there's only a 1 percentage point difference in annual returns between the top and second best sectors \u2014 consumer discretionary 25.7% vs. real estate's 24.6%. Five sectors returned between 22% to 26% per year, while the weakest performer (energy) returned a respectable 9.4%. \n \n 7. This Bull Has Gotten a Big Assist from the Fed \n \n Normally, there's a pattern to bull markets. First, stocks rise, foreshadowing a rebound in economic growth. Then once the economy actually gets into gear, the Federal Reserve starts to tap on the brakes by raising interest rates to make sure the economy \u2014 and inflation \u2014 don't overheat. \n \n The cumulative effect of Fed rate hikes are often what helps bring about the end to bull markets. \n \n This time around, though, the Fed has kept interest rates at historically low levels throughout the eight years of this bull. The Fed has lifted rates only two times throughout this entire rally \u2014 each time by a mere quarter of a percentage point. \n \n But that may change as the Fed is expected to lift rates next week. \n \n 8. This Bull Will Turn 9 \n \n This bull market has dovetailed with one of the longest business cycles in American history. But all things end, which have some worried that a recession, and stock market declines, could eventually reappear. \n \n But old age would be the wrong cause of death, should it occur. \n \n \"Bull markets don\u2019t die of old age, they die of fright,\" says Stovall. \n \n Which means there has to be something to cause investors to sell en masse and move their money into safer assets. And usually that involves concerns over negative economic growth, i.e. recessions. \n \n So will the economy contract in 2017? \n \n It doesn't appear likely. Demand for automobiles and homes remain strong, and the Fed has signaled multiple times that it believes the economy is strong enough to endure higher interest rates. \n \n But that doesn't mean you should expect prices to rise forever, or at least as much as they have in the recent past. \n \n \"With earnings growing more slowly, dividend yields and bond coupons low, and the potential for P/E ratios and real yields to mean revert, a traditional 60/40 U.S. stock/bond portfolio could well generate returns over the next five years that are less than half the roughly 8% annualized gain that such a portfolio provided over the past 25 years,\" says Kelly. ||||| If investors took a leap of faith when the bottom fell out of the market eight years ago and invested heavily in Dow stocks, most would be sitting on a fairly sizeable nest egg today. \n \n The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.08% is a benchmark of 30 large U.S. companies and generally serves as a barometer of broader market conditions; among investors here and abroad, the blue-chip average is synonymous with the U.S. stock market, period. \n \n Since the dark days of March 2009 when the Dow was barely holding onto 6,500 points, the index has soared a little more than 200%, mostly on the back of loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and other foreign central banks in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. During the same period, gold only rose 30.8%, while crude oil gained 17.5%. \n \n Compared with stocks in Europe and Asia, the Dow is clearly an overachiever. The Stoxx Europe 600 Euro SXXP, -0.02% climbed 138%, the U.K\u2019s FTSE 100 UKX, +0.62% advanced 108%, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.14% added 50% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei NIK, +0.45% rose 175% during the same time frame. \n \n Among the Dow components remaining from 2009, Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.16% is the undisputed star, soaring 608%, while American Express Co. AXP, -0.08% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.75% both surged more than 500%. \n \n Seven companies have joined the Dow after the bull market began its epic climb, doing their share to fuel the Dow\u2019s bullish run. UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +0.45% jumped 752% since the beginning of the bull market and Visa Inc. V, -0.48% skyrocketed 524%. Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.11% the youngest member of the blue-chip family, has shot up nearly 1,000% since 2009, although it rose only 9.3% since it became a Dow component two years ago. \n \n Newcomers on the Dow \n \n Stock Returns since March 2009 Date added to the Dow Returns since inclusion in the Dow Cisco Systems Inc. 136% June 8, 2009 72% Travelers Cos. 245% June 8, 2009 179% United Health Group Inc. 752% Sept. 24, 2012 201% Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 176% Sept. 23, 2013 53% Nike Inc. 457% Sept. 23, 2013 65% Visa Inc. 524% Sept. 23, 2013 81% Apple Inc. 989% March 19, 2015 9.3% Source: FactSet \n \n Yet, not all Dow stocks have posted such stellar returns. Oil major Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.07% has risen a paltry 23% while its competitor Chevron Corp. CVX, +1.02% rose 87%. \n \n International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.11% Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.10% Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.53% and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

On March 9, 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 6,547.05. Since then, it has more than tripled. If you\u2019d invested twenty thousand dollars in the Dow index eight years ago, it would now be worth about sixty-four thousand dollars. \n \n The vast majority of the market\u2019s gains came while Barack Obama was President, but since Donald Trump was elected the Dow has tacked on more than twenty-five hundred points, or about twelve per cent. Last week, it closed above twenty-one thousand for the first time, and we also saw the I.P.O. of Snap , the social-media company that owns Snapchat . At the end of Snap\u2019s first day of trading, the market placed a notional valuation on the firm, which has always operated at a loss, of thirty-four billion dollars. \u201cSince November 8th, Election Day, the Stock Market has posted $3.2 trillion in GAINS and consumer confidence is at a 15 year high. Jobs!\u201d Trump boasted on Twitter . \n \n Looking at numbers like these, many people\u2019s reaction is to try to get in on the action. Since October, about seventy-five billion dollars of new money has flowed into U.S. equity funds and exchange-traded funds, according to figures from the Investment Company Institute. Evidently, investors believe that Trump can keep the bull market going. \n \n They might be proved right\u2014but I doubt it. That\u2019s not an opinion driven by my animus toward Trump\u2019s politics, or even my belief that investors are ignoring the economic and financial risks inherent in having a man like him in the White House. (My colleague James Surowiecki wrote recently about the business world\u2019s view of Trump as a risky but not completely uncertain bet.) My skepticism about stocks is primarily based on nonpolitical factors: valuation, monetary policy, and herding behavior\u2014all of which can play key roles in driving the market. \n \n I\u2019m not arguing that we are in a full-on speculative bubble of the sort we saw in stocks during the late nineteen-nineties and in the housing and mortgage markets during the early two-thousands. Although the stratospheric valuation placed on Snap last week should be seen as a warning sign\u2014in the past few days, the company\u2019s stock has fallen back\u2014it can\u2019t be compared to the rash of dot-com I.P.O.s in 1999, or the proliferation of \u201cliar loans\u201d in the mortgage market between 2004 and 2007. Still, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S. & P. 500 index, which is perhaps the most widely followed valuation metric, now stands at more than twenty-six. \n \n That\u2019s not as high as it was during the late nineteen-nineties, but it exceeds the levels seen during any other bull market since the Second World War. Other valuation measures, such as Robert Shiller\u2019s cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, and the late James Tobin\u2019s \u201cQ ratio\u201d\u2014which measures the price of investment assets relative to their replacement cost\u2014are also emitting warning signals. Andrew Smithers, an investment analyst who tracks both of these metrics closely, wrote recently , \u201cAlthough the overvaluation of the stock market is well short of the extremes reached at the year ends of 1929 and 1999, it is near its other previous peaks of 1905, 1936, and 1968.\u201d \n \n Stock-market bulls respond to this type of analysis with two counterarguments. First: with interest rates at very low levels, stocks still represent better value than bonds and other interest-bearing investments. Second: even overvalued markets can sometimes rise a lot further before they go pop. \n \n Regarding the first argument, there can be no doubt that one of the primary drivers of the bull market has been the Federal Reserve\u2019s determination to keep the cost of borrowing very low. But the Fed is now raising interest rates, and it may well be about to step up the pace of monetary tightening. At their policymaking meeting next week, Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, and her colleagues are widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by a quarter point. Based upon recent projections from the Fed, it looks like there will be at least another two additional hikes before the year is out. \n \n Rising interest rates don\u2019t necessarily presage lower stock prices, but the two things have often gone together. They did in the mid two-thousands, the late nineteen-nineties, the late seventies, and the late sixties. The early nineties were an exception\u2014one that can be explained by an unexpected surge in productivity and G.D.P. growth, which, in turn, boosted corporate profits. To be sure, something like this could happen again: Trump is promising as much. But looking at the already low unemployment rate (4.8 per cent) and weak productivity figures, few economists think a sustained growth spurt is likely. \n \n Why, then, is the market still going up? Undoubtedly, there is a \u201cTrump factor.\u201d Many billionaire hedge-fund managers have welcomed the President\u2019s promise of lower taxes and less regulation. \u201cIf nothing else happens, that releases animal spirits,\u201d David Tepper, the head of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. In the current environment of decent growth, low inflation, and pro-business policies, Tepper added, investors \u201ccan\u2019t be short.\u201d \n \n That last comment, I suspect, is the real key to the market\u2019s buoyancy. Professional investors are buying stocks because others are buying, and they fear that if they deviate from this pattern they will be punished. (George Soros was punished late last year, when he shorted the market and, reportedly, lost a billion dollars .) Keynes warned us that herding behavior can drive markets far from reasonable valuations, and that the mispricing can last for a considerable period. Referring to short sellers who try to make money by selling high-priced stocks, he is reputed to have said, \u201cThe market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d \n \n It is folly, then, to predict what will happen on Wall Street tomorrow, next week, or next month. With many investors still upbeat, stock prices could rise further for a time. Eventually, however, overvalued markets do correct and revert to levels justified by economic fundamentals. When that happens, it is seldom pretty. There is no reason to believe things will be different this time. ||||| CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share See what could jeopardize the second-longest bull market in Wall Street history.

Smith/ /AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: BRYAN R. SMITH, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n Forget the doubters. The numbers don\u2019t lie. This Wall Street bull\u2019s got game. \n \n The rising market for stocks, which turns 8 on March 9, might finally have silenced critics who questioned its staying power. \n \n From a statistical perspective, this market's no slouch. It has posted big enough returns to rank No. 4 all-time in terms of performance, with the mega-bull run from the 1990s taking top honors with a gain of 417%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The current market can\u2019t be faulted for a lack of endurance, either, as only one bull has lasted longer. \n \n It has also generated more than $21 trillion in new stock market wealth. \n \n The star stock of this bull run? Incyte (INCY), a biotech firm whose shares have gained more than all others in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. The drug company is a Wall Street favorite for its dominant bone marrow treatment, Jakafi, and its loaded pipeline of potential drugs. The bull\u2019s biggest dud? Southwestern Energy (SWN), a victim of a price crash in oil. \n \n The best-performing group of companies the past eight years can thank U.S. shoppers. The consumer discretionary sector, which includes home improvement retailer Home Depot, coffee shop Starbucks and athletic apparel and sneaker giant Nike, has benefited from an improving economy and people\u2019s willingness to buy things not deemed necessities. The energy sector was the biggest laggard, which is no surprise given plummeting earnings for hard-hit companies in that industry. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lsIuIr ||||| If the bull market is worried about dying, it\u2019s not letting on. \n \n Eight years along and no existential crisis plagues this advance, whose unbroken march from the depths of the Great Recession is the second longest ever. Valuations are stretched and going by its age the rally is in rarefied air. But volatility, the ticker tape of investor anxiety, is nowhere to be found. \n \n So profound is the market\u2019s peace that a debate is raging over whether it\u2019s healthy: are investors willfully blinding themselves to danger in the era of Donald Trump? Whether they are, the result has been manna for anyone who\u2019s held on. Almost $3 trillion has been added to equity values since November. \n \n \u201cInvestors should now be on the lookout for a fear-of-missing-out mindset that could signal overconfidence and sound the final lap,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York. \u201cVolatility will remain a potential challenge to the intestinal fortitude of many investors and cause their emotions to become their portfolio\u2019s worst enemy.\u201d \n \n At 250 percent, the advance in the S&P 500 Index since 2009 has surpassed any bull market at the eight-year mark, plus all those that ended earlier, according to data compiled by CFRA that goes back to World War II. While history shows stocks tend to get more volatile as rallies drag on, it\u2019s not the case now. In the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has spent only 23 days rising or falling 1 percent, compared with 85 days during the eighth year of the 1990-2000 run. \n \n The bull market, driven by easy monetary policy from central banks and a doubling in corporate profits, shows few signs of waning as it heads into its ninth year. Since Trump\u2019s election in November, the S&P 500 has jumped 11 percent, going 55 days without an intraday swing of 1 percent, the longest since at least 1982. The index added 0.2 percent at 9:50 a.m. in New York. \n \n Is it good or bad when markets surge without volatility? On trading desks around Wall Street last week, charts surfaced purporting to show that \u201ccomplacency\u201d is at a record high by dividing the S&P 500\u2019s price-earnings ratio of about 22 by the CBOE Volatility Index, now near 11. The quotient exceeded levels during the dot-com bubble. \n \n Even the Fed has noticed the lack of turbulence. In the minutes from the central bank\u2019s last meeting, a few officials \u201c expressed concern that the low level of implied volatility in equity markets appeared inconsistent with the considerable uncertainty attending the outlook\u201d for Trump to deliver on pro-growth agenda. \n \n To Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer of Marketfield Asset Management in New York, neither P/E nor the VIX is useful in determining a market top on its own -- and it makes no more sense to look at a combination of the two. \n \n \u201cThis idea can be summed up by the old term \u2018two wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d\u2019 Shaoul said in an interview. \u201cWe can complain that valuations are no longer appealing and that the steady staircase-like move is unnerving, but we cannot say that these factors in themselves mean the end is nigh.\u201d \n \n Steady gains have coaxed investors back to stocks. They poured $60 billion into American equity ETFs and mutual funds in the last four months, an amount recorded only twice over any similar stretch in this bull market, data compiled by Investment Company Institute and Bloomberg show. From 2009 to 2016, withdrawals exceeded $200 billion. \n \n Investors may be forgiven for their reluctance to embrace equities. While the market ruptures that followed Britain\u2019s June vote to exit the European Union and Trump\u2019s November election proved temporary, they were among the five instances in just two years of what Deutsche Bank AG categorizes as an extreme shift in equity volatility. Before that, it took two decades to record five such events. \n \n And the current tranquility does appear to be a bit out of touch with history. In an average bull market, the number of days with 1 percent move usually more than doubles to 65 in year seven after falling in the first three years. During the Internet boom, the only post-war bull market that lasted longer than this one, year nine saw such days surge to 95. \n \n The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. \n \n While Trump\u2019s plans to lower taxes and boost public spending may accelerate a rebound in corporate profits, anyone anticipating the peaceful advance to continue may be making a mistake, according to John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. Catalysts abound for volatility outbreaks, from Fed tightening to Trump disappointment to risks associated with the French presidential election and China\u2019s currency policy, he wrote in March 6 note. \n \n \u201cThe ever so unloved and disdained bull market might have more upside than even its earliest adapters and supporters project,\u201d Stoltzfus said. But \u201cWith the transition taking place in Washington, changes in monetary policy stateside as well as upcoming elections abroad with issues around populism and nationalism, we expect the market will not show much tolerance should it detect investor complacency.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Thursday is a Wall Street milestone: The bull market that began on March 9, 2009, turns 8 years old, making it the second-longest such run in history. (It would need to go another year and a half or so to match the record from 1990 to 2000.) Some coverage: On this day in 2009, the S&P 500 plunged to 676. Since then, it's rallied about 250%. The Wall Street Journal has a funky graphic illustrating the near-historic run here. The Dow closed that same day at 6,547, and if you'd invested $20,000 then, it would be worth $64,000 today, notes the New Yorker. But the post has a warning: \"With many investors still upbeat, stock prices could rise further for a time. Eventually, however, overvalued markets do correct and revert to levels justified by economic fundamentals.\" Reuters, however, suggests a bear is nowhere in sight. \"The bull market is going to finish, in our view, when conditions begin to accumulate that tend to lead to a recession,\" says one analyst. \"We just don't see that as a 2017 or 2018 event.\" What's unusual about the long run is what Bloomberg calls the \"freakish calm\" surrounding it. There's barely a whiff of volatility or investor anxiety, so much so that there's now a debate underway about whether that's healthy. One consequence of the bull run is that stocks and bonds are now quite expensive by historical standards, according to Money. It runs down that and other factoids here. The top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Index since 2009? Home Depot, which is up more than 600%. MarketWatch looks at other winners. The star stock in the S&P has been biotech firm Incyte, notes USA Today. There's some debate on when this bull market actually began, and Michael Santoli at CNBC runs through it.

    "concatenated_intermediate": "\u2013 The stock market's current bull market is now eight years old. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index hit an all-time high of 676 on March 9, 2009, just two weeks after the financial crisis hit. The standard definition of a bull market, as laid out by CNBC, says one must decline at least 20% from a high. That hasn't happened since September 2011, when the S&P fell more than 20% from its high. Some say that date overstates the start of the current bull, which is the second-longest ever, per MarketWatch. \"There have been so few that it' \u2013 The stock market's eight-year bull run is officially over. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 10,000 for the first time since the financial crisis on Tuesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed below that mark. The Wall Street Journal notes that the Dow's 4.6% drop this year is its worst performance since the Great Depression. The last time the Dow fell more than 5% in a single year was during the depths of the Great Recession in the fall of 2008. \"Even if we decree that the bull market truly started five-and-a-half years, or four years ago, or 13 months ago \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average has closed above 11,000 for the first time since the financial crisis began, MarketWatch reports. The Dow hit a high of 11, above which it would need to fall for it to fall below the 10,000 mark. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also hit new highs. The last time the Dow crossed the 11,000 mark was in October 2007, according to CNBC. \u2013 The stock market's longest-ever bull market turned eight years old on Thursday, and with good reason. The Standard & Poor's 500 index has climbed 250 percent since hitting a low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009. The gains since, uninterrupted by a decline of 20% or more, rank this bull market as the second longest ever. The current run is nearly three years older than the average bull and more than a year shorter than the longest one: the rally from Oct. 11, 1990 to March 24, 2000. strategists, however, warn that a correction of as much as 10% should be expected as the market is richly \u2013 Wednesday is the eighth birthday of the stock market's longest-ever bull market, which began in March 2009 at the depths of the Great Recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 20,000 for the first time, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed above that mark, reports the Wall Street Journal. Here's what you need to know to mark the occasion: Only one other bull market\u2014the one that began in the aftermath of the financial crisis and lasted from October 1990 to March 2000\u2014has lasted this long. The market has been whipsawed by ups and downs, and this bull has \u2013 It's been a wild ride for the stock market this year, with the Dow closing above 20,000 for the first time and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting all-time highs. Here's what you need to know about the current bull market: The market's price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, is now at 29.8, a level last seen during the dot.com bubble and Great Depression, reports MarketWatch. That's a lot higher than it was at the start of the recession, and analysts say it's due in part to President Trump's tax cuts and \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average hasn't been this high since the financial crisis, but it's still more than 200% higher than it was in March 2009, the Wall Street Journal reports. If you're looking for a reliable indicator of the market's health, the Dow is \"clearly an overachiever,\" the Journal notes, with returns of 77% since 2009 compared to 77% for the Dow's rivals, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Of course, not all of the Dow components have performed so well, with just seven joining the index after it began its climb\u2014including, of course, seven companies that have risen more \u2013 The last time the Dow closed above 20,000, the stock market was in the middle of a bear market. On Thursday, eight years after that low point, it closed above that mark for the first time, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Dow is up more than 1,000 points since President Trump won the election, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up about the same. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d writes Henry Blodget at Business Insider. \u201cThat\u2019s not an opinion driven by my animus toward Trump\u2019s politics, or even my belief that investors are ignoring the economic and financial risks inherent in having a \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 22,000 for the first time on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also hit new highs, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Dow's gain of 342 points, or 1.6%, brought it within striking distance of the all-time high of 2,872 set in October 2007. The Nasdaq, however, is still down more than 1,000 points since Donald Trump won the election. The Journal sees the stock market's rise as a result of a \"Trump factor,\" with many billionaire hedge-fund managers citing the president's promises of lower taxes and less regulation. \u2013 The stock market's current bull run, which marks its eighth birthday on March 9, is the second-longest in history, trailing only the one that began in the early 1990s, USA Today reports. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the current bull has gained more than $21 trillion in new stock market wealth. It has also posted big returns to rank No. 4 all-time in terms of performance, with the mega-bull run from the 1990s taking top honors with a gain of 417%. The current market can't be faulted for a lack of endurance, either, as only one \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 20,000 for the first time Monday, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also had record highs, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Dow hit the mark at the open and stayed there for most of the day, though it came down a bit in the last half-hour of trading. The Journal sees the Dow's record as a sign that the bull market, which began in 2009 and is the second-longest ever, is in no danger of dying. USA Today, meanwhile, looks at the market's peace and asks the question: \"Are investors willfully blinding themselves \u2013 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also hit new highs, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Dow's gain of 342 points, or 1.6%, puts it within striking distance of the all-time high it hit on Oct. 2, though it's still down about 400 points from its recent peak. The Journal notes that the market's recent rise has been helped along by steadier-than-expected economic reports from the US and Europe, as well as the prospect of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve under President",

The decision to grant Madonna the adoption order remains in the hands of the court. The AP reports that the \u201cLiving for Love\u201d singer will have to wait one week before finding out if she is able to move forward with the adoptions. \n \n The pop diva, who adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, in 2008 and 2009, respectively, founded her Raising Malawi foundation in 2006 to benefit the orphans and underprivileged children living in the impoverished nation. \n \n During an October 2006 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Madonna shared why she was inspired to adopt from Malawi. \n \n \u201cTo see 8-year-olds in charge of households. To see mothers dying, with Kaposi's sarcoma lesions all over their bodies. To see open sewages everywhere. To see what I saw. It is a state of emergency.

And I was warned by my social worker that because there were no known laws in Malawi, they were more or less going to have to make them up as we went along. And she did say to me, 'Pick Ethiopia. Go to Kenya. Don't go to Malawi because you're just going to get a hard time.'\" \n \n Madonna adopted David with ex-husband Guy Ritchie, whom she divorced in 2008 after eight years of marriage. She shares 16-year-old son Rocco with the British filmmaker too.

You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ||||| One tweet too many \n \n X marks the spot where Denis Finley, editor of the paper in Bernie Sanders' hometown, screwed up. If Oprah Winfrey was the media's Big Winner for her Golden Globes peroration on sexual harassment, Finley was a (fortunately less-publicized) Big Loser due to ham-handed tweets. \n \n Even the most sober of mainstream media get bollixed up over page views and reader engagement as they seek to be more refined P.T. Barnums of a digital age. Being provocative for provocation's sake is increasingly rationalized as a way to promote your handiwork, no matter how tenuous and fleeting the actual loyalty manifested (perhaps with help from a Drudge Report link) might be. \n \n But, as Finley, executive editor of the Gannett-owned Burlington Free Press, unwittingly reminds us, there's a difference between being responsibly provocative and perhaps tone deaf to your audience \u2014 especially in the digital age. \n \n Vermont plans to join Oregon and Washington, D.C., in offering drivers a third option in listing gender on licenses. So M, F or X. In liberal Burlington, where Sanders was mayor, it's not unpopular. And it just prompted one citizen's tweet, \"This is awesome! // #VT Is One Step Closer To Offering A Third Gender On Driver's Licenses.\" But Finley, who came to the Free Press from Virginia in 2016 after a long stint as Norfolk Virginian-Pilot editor (and, briefly, as publicist for a Norfolk museum), felt compelled to respond: \"Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse.\" \n \n If Winfrey played brilliantly to her audience, Finley fumbled in recognizing his. The Vermont online universe is now filled with mostly outrage, and claims of canceling subscriptions. In fact, it was only the third in a succession of curious tweets by Finley. They underscored the tempting perils of journalists, even newsroom bosses, who feel compelled to opine on, well, just about anything.Thus, Finley saw an Associated Press tweet on how fans of Frank Lloyd Wright are seeking to prevent the demolition of a Montana office building designed in 1958. This inspired a response: \"I don't care who designed them, destroy all office buildings.\" \n \n Fine. Chalk that up to lame humor. Then, after word from none other than The New York Times that \"Former President Barack Obama is to be the first guest on David Letterman's new monthly Netflix talk show,\" he sought to exhibit his inner Jimmy Kimmel with this: \"Another reason not to subscribe to Netflix.\" That was lame, with a smidgen of the obtuse. \n \n As outrage quickly manifested itself over the gender matter, Finley seemed to dig a deeper hole. A Tim Sinnott tweeted that the state policy was awesome \"because recognition is awesome\" and Finley responded, \"All recognition? Any recognition, Tim? What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking. Not all recognition is awesome.\" \n \n Finley was either high-mindedly engaged in a Socratic inquiry, as if teaching a constitutional law seminar, or manifesting Jonesean (as in Alex Jones, of InfoWars) subtlety cum derision. If I'm a top Gannett official, I might now be wondering if a second bomb cyclone affecting New England is actually on my payroll. \n \n \"So you think trans people are the equivalent of pedophiles?\" Anderson asked. \n \n When tracked down by Vermont's Seven Days about the flap (He declined comment when I contacted him, saying, \"Maybe in a few days\"), Finley said, \"I really just wanted to ask the question: 'Why is that awesome? And why is that necessary?' That\u2019s all, and I think any journalist would ask that question.\" He said use of the word apocalypse was inspired by a Sports Illustrated feature, \"Signs of the Apocalypse.\" \n \n When I passed through Burlington last summer, there were still Sanders T-shirts in store windows. How long before some retail outlets offer a tie-dyed image of Finley with a big, fat \"X\"? \n \n \"Denis Finley doesn't seem to care that, when he enters the arena as executive editor, he carries the reputation of his news organization with him. 'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,\" says Tom Kearney, deputy managing editor of the Stowe Reporter, Waterbury Record and News & Citizen of Morrisville, and executive editor of the Shelburne News and The Citizen, which serves Charlotte and Hinesburg. \n \n Then there's Jon Margolis, who was an A-list national political writer during his heyday with The Chicago Tribune. That was a pre-internet world where reporters and editors weren't tweeting their views on everything from whom they'd seen at lunch, a referee's call in the NFL game they were watching or, of course, every breathing moment of Donald Trump. \n \n \"Why this urge to tweet so often?\" asks Margolis, who is retired in South Burlington, a few blocks from the Burlington city line. \"I do not think the world breathlessly awaits my latest witty aphorism or my personal take on what happened today. If I have something to offer that\u2019s worthwhile, I\u2019ll write a piece about it. That means reporting \u2014 online, on the phone, at somebody\u2019s office. And then writing, as well as possible, which means as succinctly as possible but always more than 280 clicks of the keyboard.\" \n \n \n \n \"Tweeting is like artificial turf. The technology makes it possible, not advisable. That would apply even where the tweet is not as aggressively ignorant as Finley\u2019s. But just think: Were he writing an article instead of a blurt (essentially what a tweet is) he might have read it over and then altered (or deep-sixed) it. Or had somebody else edit it, which even the boss should always do. Amazing how the conventional processes of newspapers can save us from ourselves.\" \n \n Jake Tapper vs. Stephen Miller \n \n Jousting between cable TV hosts and guests is now a performance fixture. Bill O'Reilly rode it to riches before his sexual harassment self-immolation. In its most pedestrian post-O'Reilly form, it brings some well intentioned but weak liberal saps served up as red meat for Fox's Tucker Carlson. \n \n In a fairer tussle, it brought us CNN's Jake Tapper and White House aide Stephen Miller. And Tapper giving him the boot. \n \n Tapper is evolving into his network's prime skeptic of all things Trump and, unlike Carlson, not reflexively given to pillorying lightweight guests. And Miller is the unbridled partisan who has reveled in public combat ever since his high school days at a largely liberal Los Angeles high school \n \n As The New York Times' Matt Flegenheimer has put it in a profile of Miller, his life \"is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.\" \n \n \"These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House \u2014 and many former peers fear.\" \n \n This all began with the equally pro forma, and dungeon's host salutation, \"Stephen, thanks so much for joining us and happy new year, good to see you.\" \n \n On Sunday, Miller called Michael Wolff the \"garbage author of a garbage book,\" a rather mediocre pre-meditated line for someone of his acerbic and calculating essence. He called Trump a \"political genius.\" He called it a \"work of pure fiction.\" And \"a pile of trash.\" \n \n It was mostly solid, fair-minded inquisition by Tapper for about six minutes, until it first got a tad personal and each started cutting off the other. Miller referred to CNN's Trump coverage as hysterical, and Tapper suggested it was Miller who was being hysterical. As if Miler were a child, Tapper asked him to \"settle down, settle down.\" \n \n At the nine-minute mark, what had seemed a small lull turned sour as Tapper brought up a letter that Miller wrote on the subject of firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Miller stumbled a tad before Tapper broached the president's bizarre Saturday tweet on his own purported genius. \n \n Tapper correctly persisted in broaching the public discourse on Trump's rationality, as Miller sought to divert the topic to his theme of CNN being out of touch with a working America that his boss understands and CNN doesn't. \n \n Then, Tapper had enough. He said that Miller was being \"obsequious,\" playing to an audience of one (Trump) and not answering his question. He simply cut him off. It was rather abrupt and could have been executed in a less peremptory manner. It came off as a host losing control, as much as Trump critics loved the scene and think Miller deserved it. But if you don't want to fight the lions, stay away from their pen. \n \n Regardless, both Miller and Tapper surely came away thinking they'd won (maybe all the more so as Miller was escorted out by security). Predictably, Trump soon tweeted some venom Tapper's way: \"Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!\" \n \n New York Times unveils ad on Golden Globes \n \n Truly salute The New York Times for actually trying to market excellence in a way that's about 20 years late for most of the newspaper industry. It unveiled the next part of its \"The Truth is Hard\" brand campaign during NBC's Golden Globes broadcast. \n \n Similar to its first ad on last year's Oscars, the ad features black type against a white background. \"He said, she said\" are the first words you see. Then they are repeated multiple times until it's just, \"She said, she said, she said, she said,\" with the ad ending \"The truth has power. The truth will not be threatened. The truth has a voice.\" \n \n The \"truth has a voice\" is a simple and potent notion. But, as a TV spot, it falls a bit flat. As one top advertising executive told me, it's unlikely that most viewers connected the paper's incredible sex harassment reporting, including on Harvey Weinstein, and the ad. For those who who did \u2014 the event was filled with unavoidable talk of sex harassment in Hollywood, including Seth Meyers' opening monologue \u2014 the ad was preaching to the choir. \n \n Potency of advertising involves melding the right media and the right audience. In a narrow sense, the Golden Globes might seem a good target \u2014 but only in a narrow sense. The Times has a great narrative to spin as to why it should be trusted, including its admirable attention to fact-checking and precision (even with some hotly disputed cuts in the copy editing force). Perhaps a larger campaign can include such factors. \n \n It's because the challenge for quality media involves more than the mere declaration of virtue. As with changing the attitudes of Americans toward sex harassment, changing attitudes toward even the best of media \u2014 especially when it comes to people paying for content \u2014 will involve a military-like campaign, with no one-size-fits-all-messages and the unavoidable (and very expensive) need to make the case with unprecedented regularity and persistence. \n \n TV news viewing continues to head south, Trump aside \n \n As Poynter reports, \"Until now, local TV news viewership has been declining slowly. But a new Pew research study shows that from 2016 to 2017, the decline picked up speed.\" \n \n Younger Americans' turn from TV news is important. But, somewhere in the mix, is surely ideology, though the study does not point explicitly to what's been previously shown to be the sharp decline in Republicans' confidence in \"mass media.\" \n \n A revealing photo history \n \n The Associated Press put together a gallery of photos of what actresses have tended to wear at the Golden Globe Awards over the years, as opposed to the black dresses they pointedly wore last night. \n \n The morning Babel \n \n CNN opened with Trump defending his mental fitness and, no surprise, a very brief take at colleague Tapper's spat with Miller. It gave rather more time to social media hurrahs about Winfrey's Golden Globes speech and the notion of her running for president. \n \n \"When you think of the Democratic lineup for 2020 ... you pretty quickly run out of star power,\" said Brian Stelter, media reporter cum political analyst. \"If you want to fight fire with fire, Trump is a reality TV star and Oprah Winfrey has been on TV in some ways longer than he has. There are a lot of reasons why this might make sense to Democratic insiders. That speech if anything, gave people more reason to dream it up.\" For sure, there was a smattering of speculation. But, one might hope, it quickly encounters recognition of what's playing out before us: the obvious limits of electing somebody with no experience in the arena. \n \n MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" backed Tapper's performance (\"I would have cut it short after the second answer,\" said Mika Brzezinski) and was the latest to get time with author Michael Wolff. And, before then, there was Axios' Jonathan Swan on what appears to be Trump's shrinking work schedule and also the co-hosts' riff on Trump's insecurity. The latter included the co-hosts venturing into the topic of TV stars, no names mentioned, being self-absorbed (\"We've met a lot of people in television who are narcissistic and stupid,\" Brzezinski said). Hmmm. \n \n But it was a different tone on Trump's favorite morning show, \"Trump & Friends,\" where co-host Brian Kilmeade surfaced at Pancake Pantry in Nashville, Tenn., for breakfast and generally supportive Trump chat. Oh, he was also giving away free to diners copies of new books both by himself and co-host Ainsley Earhardt. Call it a celebration of American commerce. \n \n Sending individuals back to harm \n \n Sarah Stillman, who heads the Global Migration Project at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has been compiling a database of individuals essentially deported to harm, even death in Central America. With the help of a dozen students, and lots of activists involved in immigrant rights, humanitarian aid and other organizations, she's now uncovered patterns of awful consequences to what can at times seem almost frivolous infractions and, too, insufficient government due diligence and articulation to individuals of their rights. The melancholy bottom line is underscored in this New Yorker piece. \n \n Terrific women in a mostly male soccer universe \n \n Watching loads of English soccer over the past week, I was reminded of the terrific in-studio hosting work of Brit Rebecca Lowe for NBC's fine coverage of Premier League matches, as well as Brit Kate Abdo (who is also fluent in Spanish, German and French) for Fox Sports' solid (not quite as strong and measured as NBC's) coverage of the related FA Cup tournament. The latter is one in which the top rank teams are thrown into a mix with lower division ones in frequent David vs. Goliath contests (often at the very quaint fields of the Davids). Sunday, mighty Arsenal was such a victim. \n \n And yet, they are surrounded by a sea of men, in studio and out, with all the match announcers men and, with a single seeming exception, glimpsed in an Arsenal-Nottingham Forest match yesterday, all the refs and linesman are male (there was a female linesman). \n \n New England hoopla \n \n New England Patriots fans have reason to be suspicious of ESPN, as Boston.com columnist Chad Finn, underscores. An us-versus-the-world mindset is partly fueled by some inaccurate reporting on the Patriots by ESPN. But when it comes to its chronicle of rising tensions among the owner, coach and star quarterback, Finn defends reporter Seth Wickersham \n \n The reflexive doubts are too bad, he writes, since \"if the story is read with clear eyes and all rooting interests aside, it\u2019s far more illuminating than it is salacious.\" \n \n Are we so sure that Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction? \n \n Writing in the excellent Lawfare blog, Harvard Law's Jack Goldsmith raises the possibility that the seeming lack of recusal by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the Mueller Russia investigation might suggest that there's not the obstruction investigation that folks assume (speculation fueled further by a Michael Schmidt opus in The New York Times last week). \n \n \"One possibility is that Rosenstein has no conflict because Mueller is not actually investigating the president for obstruction. It has been widely reported for months in multiple reputable outlets that Mueller is conducting such an investigation. Schmidt\u2019s story implies that he is, and reports that Mueller has evidence in his possession that appears relevant only to an obstruction investigation.\" \n \n The reader over your shoulder \n \n There's unavoidable counsel to journalists in a blog in the Paris Review, the literary bastion founded by the late George Plimpton, as Patricia O'Conner an author and former staff writer at The New York Times Book Review, discusses a 1940s work by poet-novelist Robert Graves, \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose.\u201d \n \n The book turned on the notion that writers should imagine a bunch of readers standing over their shoulder, in the process laying out 41 core principles and, then, annealing 50 excerpts of writing from famous authors to school headmasters. Graves was pretty fearless in underscoring lack of clarity. \n \n As O'Conner puts it, \"Those forty-one principles work both ways; they make for better reading as well as better writing. They can show a reader what\u2019s wrong with something that rings false or doesn\u2019t make sense or leaves questions unanswered. In a climate where rumors, impressions, and outright lies are sometimes treated as fact, informed readers are more important than ever. No democracy can afford to be without readers who can ask the right questions, who can critically judge what they read, who can mentally peer over an author\u2019s shoulder.\" \n \n And tonight's big college football championship game \n \n It's Alabama versus Georgia and, reports The Wall Street Journal this morning, \"ESPN, armed with new data about its viewers, is more aggressively selling its female audience, starting with the College Football Playoff, which culminates in Monday\u2019s championship game. The timing couldn\u2019t be better. Advertisers are looking for new ways to reach women, and more efficiently reach broader audiences, as consumer viewing habits change.\" \n \n \"Financial services firm Northwestern Mutual is among the advertisers using college football to reach women and families. The company wasn\u2019t new to the playoff, and knew that the sporting event reached a 'healthy mix of men and women and families,' but a new pitch and compelling data from ESPN helped the company 'come up with different ad spots' targeting women and families, said Aditi Gokhale, Northwestern Mutual\u2019s chief marketing officer.\" \n \n Corrections?

From South Beach in Chatham, to the northern tip of Nauset Beach in Orleans, shark sightings are keeping bathers out of the water. \n \n One swimmer said, \"Someone told me they can't come close to the edge, but I don't believe that anymore, so I'm just staying out.\" \n \n The sightings aren't the first of the summer.

Mueller also secured a guilty plea from George Papadopoulos, a low-level campaign foreign policy adviser, who lied to the FBI about his attempts to arrange a meeting between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. \n \n The anger from Republicans appears to mirror the feelings of Trump, who on Friday unloaded in a series of tweets urging his own Justice Department to investigate Democrats \u2014 not him \u2014 for transgressions he says occurred during the 2016 election. \n \n \"This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering,\" he said, accusing Democrats of the same charges that Manafort was hit with. \"[W]here is our Justice Department?\u201d \n \n Most Republicans, including those in GOP leadership, are not on board with dismissing Mueller. \n \n But the conservative push has worried some on the left, who are urging Democratic lawmakers to step up their defense of Mueller. \n \n \u201cWhile it might be ideal to wait to speak out until Mueller finishes his investigation, Trump\u2019s defenders in Congress are not waiting to defend the President\u2019s actions or to pass judgment on the investigation,\u201d CAP Action Fund wrote in a memo being prepared for lawmakers and obtained by POLITICO. \u201cThe heightened risk to Trump from Mueller\u2019s investigation also means there is a heightened risk to the Mueller investigation from Trump.\u201d \n \n Other conservatives, like Reps. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), have already called for Mueller\u2019s departure. \n \n DeSantis, too, has ramped up his efforts to hinder Mueller\u2019s investigation. He recently pushed an amendment, which failed to gain traction, that would have curtailed Mueller\u2019s probe within six months and limited its scope. \n \n And in a Thursday interview with Breitbart Radio, DeSantis blamed Rosenstein for a \u201cclumsy\u201d decision to appoint Mueller without putting strict limits on his scope. \n \n \u201cRosenstein really muffed this,\u201d he said. \n \n Breitbart News Editor Alex Marlow, who interviewed DeSantis, promised to give his proposal a lot of airtime and ink. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pushing it heavily or at least content on it heavily,\u201d he said. \n \n In his interview, DeSantis also foreshadowed the end of the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s separate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. \n \n \u201cThe good news on the congressional side, at least in the House, is from what I understand, they\u2019ve really increased the frequency of the interviews of the people and I think on the House side this Russia-Trump [probe] is going to come to an end soon,\u201d he said. \n \n DeSantis isn\u2019t on the intelligence panel but said talking to committee members, he\u2019s convinced it\u2019ll be done \u201ccertainly before the end of the year.\u201d \n \n He also said he\u2019s been urging Speaker Paul Ryan to curtail the House investigation. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Speaker, we\u2019ve been spinning these wheels.

But if not, then we\u2019ve got to get on with our business,\u2019\u201d adding, \u201cI think that message has been received.\u201d \n \n While the new resolution faults Mueller for leading the probe despite his professional relationship with Comey, it also includes a broader broadside against the FBI. \n \n The three lawmakers say the agency should be investigated for \u201cwillful blindness\u201d over a seven-year-old sale of uranium production facilities to Russian interests, which conservatives have argued was approved in part by the Hillary Clinton-led State Department at the same time a party to the deal was making donations to the Clinton Foundation. \n \n Mueller, they note, was presiding over the FBI at the time the agency was investigating a Russian bribery and extortion scheme connected to the uranium deal, but the agency declined to notify Congress of its investigation and prevented a confidential informant from notifying lawmakers. \n \n \u201cAny thorough and honest investigation into the corruption of American-uranium related business must include investigating the willful blindness of the FBI and its leaders,\u201d according to the resolution. \n \n CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the name of President Donald Trump's former campaign manager. ||||| Thomson Reuters Robert Mueller. \n \n Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida is calling for Robert Mueller to resign as the special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 US election. \n \n Gaetz cites a lack of charges relating to a 2010 uranium deal approved by US government agencies under Mueller's watch as the reason. \n \n \n \n WASHINGTON - A group of conservative Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution on Friday calling for Robert Mueller to recuse himself as the special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 US election and whether President Donald Trump's campaign team colluded with Moscow. \n \n Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Louie Gohmert of Texas say Mueller should step down because he was the FBI director in 2010 when US government agencies approved the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian energy company, to a Russian nuclear-energy firm. The deal required approval because Uranium One had mining operations in the US. \n \n Gaetz says the issue is that Mueller's FBI had found evidence of criminal activity that may have been relevant to the deal but did not bring any charges, and that Mueller therefore should recuse himself from the current investigation. \n \n \"These deeply troubling events took place when Mr. Mueller was the Director of the FBI. As such, his impartiality is hopelessly compromised,\" Gaetz said in a statement. \"He must step down immediately.\" \n \n Many of Gaetz's Republican colleagues, however, have previously expressed support for Mueller and his investigation. Senate Republicans have even introduced bills to create a barrier between Trump and Mueller in the event the president attempts to fire him. \n \n Some conservatives have latched on to the Uranium One deal recently, pointing to a report tangentially tying the deal to the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who was the secretary of state at the time, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. ||||| Three GOP congressmen introduced a resolution Friday calling for special counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the Russia collusion probe, citing his ties to the FBI and its role in controversies involving Russia. \n \n Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, along with co-sponsors, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, introduced the resolution on Friday. \n \n \u201cEvidence has emerged that the FBI withheld information from Congress and from the American people about Russian corruption of American uranium companies,\u201d Gaetz said in a statement Friday. \u201cA confidential U.S. witness, working in the Russian nuclear industry, revealed that Russia had deeply compromised an American uranium trucking firm through bribery and financial kickbacks.\u201d \n \n Gaetz was referring to Mueller\u2019s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company, Uranium One, that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves. At the time of the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director. Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe. \n \n MUELLER FACING NEW REPUBLICAN PRESSURE TO RESIGN IN RUSSIA PROBE \n \n Gaetz also pointed to the FBI informant, whose gag order was lifted by the Justice Department last week, and is now able to provide information to Congress, free of the FBI\u2019s nondisclosure agreement he signed when Mueller served as director. \n \n \u201cAlthough federal agents possessed this information in 2010, the Department of Justice continued investigating this \u201cmatter\u201d for over four years. The FBI, led at the time by Robert Mueller, required the confidential witness to sign a non-disclosure agreement. When the witness attempted to contact Congress and federal courts about the bribery and corruption he saw, he was threatened with legal action,\u201d Gaetz said in a statement. \u201cBy silencing him, Obama\u2019s Justice Department and Mueller\u2019s FBI knowingly kept Congress in the dark about Russia\u2019s significant and illegal involvement with American uranium companies.\u201d \n \n Gaetz said that due to these \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d events, Mueller\u2019s \u201cimpartiality is hopelessly compromised.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cHe must step down immediately,\u201d Gaetz said Friday. \n \n Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., has also called for Mueller\u2019s resignation. \n \n Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called for an independent special counsel to investigate the Obama-era Uranium One deal. \n \n There are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch\u2019s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators. \n \n The proposed resolution comes just days after Mueller\u2019s team announced the first charges in their investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election. \n \n Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts by a federal grand jury as part of the probe. Both pleaded not guilty. And Former Trump foreign policy campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos entered a guilty plea on Monday after admittedly making false statements to the FBI.",

Lemos, the chief forensic toxicologist for the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office, said there have been confirmed cases in which marijuana has had harmful effects on the heart. \n \n \"The potential cardiotoxicity of cannabis has been reported in peer-reviewed abstracts as well as scientific proceedings before, including by my team,\" Lemos said. \n \n \"This case report adds two more cases from Germany, but since late last year, we have known and reported on this drug's potential cardiotoxic effects in some parts of the general population,\" he said. \n \n The researchers in Germany who reported the deaths declined an interview request from Live Science, citing an overwhelming media response to the paper and \"some quite unpleasant reactions from individuals.\" \n \n Following the online publication of the paper, Jost Leune, the head of the German Association for Drugs and Addiction in Hannover, Germany, criticized the report in an interview with the website TheLocal.de, saying, \"Cannabis does not paralyze the breathing or the heart.\" \n \n \"Deaths due to cannabis use are usually accidents that are not caused by the substance, but to the circumstances of use,\" Leune said. \n \n However, other recent research also has linked marijuana use with cardiovascular complications in young and middle-age adults. In a study published in April in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers examined data on health complications following marijuana use, gathered from 2006 to 2010 by the French Addictovigilance Network. They found that among the 2,000 cases of reported complications, 35 cases involved heart problems. Among those were 20 people who had heart attacks, including nine who died. \n \n \"There is now compelling evidence on the growing risk of marijuana-associated adverse cardiovascular effects, especially in young people,\" study author \u00c9milie Jouanjus, a medical faculty member at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse in France, said in a statement at the time. \"It is, therefore, important that doctors, including cardiologists, be aware of this, and consider marijuana use as one of the potential causes in patients with cardiovascular disorders.\" \n \n \"It is important that people realize that any drug can have harmful effects,\" Iain M. McIntyre, a director and chief toxicologist at the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office, told Live Science. \n \n Some people who are predisposed to cardiac events may be particularly vulnerable to potential harmful effects of marijuana use, and the new report shows this, McIntyre said. \n \n One limitation of the report, however, was that it did not specify for how long the two men had been using marijuana, he said. \n \n The researchers who wrote the report stressed that the risk of cardiovascular effects of marijuana use in the general population is low, but it is higher in people who have cardiovascular issues. \n \n \"Persons who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases are even recommended to avoid the use of cannabis,\" they wrote. \n \n Lemos said he hopes the report will raise awareness of the potential health complications of marijuana use. \"I am delighted to see this additional work in hope that medical examiners, coroners and physicians will realize that they need to collect specimens, test for cannabis in post-mortem fluids and consider the contributions of cannabis in the death investigations. \n \n \"We simply cannot, any longer, adhere to the old mentality that 'marijuana does not kill,\" Lemos told Live Science. \"We are now seeing evidence from my office and elsewhere that it just might.\" \n \n The case report was published in the April issue of the journal Forensic Science International. \n \n Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

They identified 35 cases of cardiovascular and vascular conditions related to the heart, brain and limbs. \n \n Among their findings: \n \n Most of the patients were male, average age 34.3 years. \n \n Nearly 2 percent (35 of the 1,979) marijuana-related complications were cardiovascular complications. \n \n Of the 35 cases, 22 were heart-related, including 20 heart attacks; 10 were peripheral with diseases related to arteries in the limbs; and three were related to the brain\u2019s arteries. \n \n The percentage of reported cardiovascular complications more than tripled from 2006 to 2010. \n \n Nine patients, or 25.6 percent, died. \n \n Researchers note that marijuana use and any resulting health complications are likely underreported. There are 1.2 million regular users in France, and thus potentially a large amount of complications that are not detected by the French Addictovigilance System. \n \n \u201cThe general public thinks marijuana is harmless, but information revealing the potential health dangers of marijuana use needs to be disseminated to the public, policymakers and healthcare providers,\u201d Jouanjus said. \n \n People with pre-existing cardiovascular weaknesses appear to be more prone to the harmful effects of marijuana. \n \n \u201cThere is now compelling evidence on the growing risk of marijuana-associated adverse cardiovascular effects, especially in young people,\u201d Jouanjus said. \u201cIt is therefore important that doctors, including cardiologists, be aware of this, and consider marijuana use as one of the potential causes in patients with cardiovascular disorders.\u201d \n \n Surveillance of marijuana-related reports of cardiovascular disorders should continue and more research needs to look at how marijuana use might trigger cardiovascular events, she said. \n \n Co-authors are Maryse Lapeyre-Mestre, M.D., Ph.D., and Joelle Micallef, M.D., Ph.D. There are no author disclosures. \n \n The study was funded by French InterMinisterial mission for the fight against drugs and addiction, MILDT (Mission interminist\u00e9rielle de lutte contre les drogues et toxicomanies) and the French drug agency ANSM (Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 des M\u00e9dicaments). \n \n Additional Resources: \n \n For more information on this subject view the AHA Heart Blog post: States move forward with marijuana legalization despite lack of research . \n \n . infographic available on the right column of the release link http://newsroom.heart.org/news/marijuana-use-may-increase-heart-complications-in-young-middle-aged-adults?preview=b7b428026ac982ed55d512c1ad0f62fe. \n \n Follow AHA/ASA news on Twitter @HeartNews. \n \n ###",

    "document": "'Christmas' Winning War on Christmas in Marketing Messages \n \n But AFA Carries on Fight by Targeting Dick's Sporting Goods, as Retailer Promotes 'Holiday Shop' \n \n NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- The War on Christmas may be in its final days. \n \n This season, merry Christmas -- not happy holidays or season's greetings -- will dominate retailer's marketing messages. There will be Christmas sales and Christmas trees and Christmas carols galore. That has the American Family Association, arguably one of the loudest voices advocating the use of Christmas in retailer's marketing messages over the past few years, predicting that its crusade could conclude in the next year or two. \n \n Dick's Holiday Shop Dick's Holiday Shop \n \n Randy Sharp, director-special projects at the AFA, said that in the past five years the group has seen the percentage of retailers recognizing Christmas in their advertising rise from 20% to 80%. Just eight retailers are left on the group's list of \" Companies Against Christmas .\" \n \n It's also become more challenging to find a large, national retailer to single out for the group's annual boycott. This year, Dick's Sporting Goods, which boasts an online \"Holiday Shop,\" will be the target of the boycott. The AFA is expected to send an Action Alert to its 2.3 million supporters on Friday morning. That alert will urge shoppers to boycott Dick's between now and Dec. 25. It also calls for consumers to email President-Chief Operating Officer Joseph Schmidt and then call Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Hennion. The retailer declined to comment. In the past, Target, Sears, Gap Inc. and Walmart have been targets. \n \n \"We've had a complete flip,\" Mr. Sharp says. \"The politically correct holiday verbiage is going away. Companies are getting the message.\" \n \n Indeed, retailers that have found themselves the target of boycotts or media and consumer scrutiny have responded swiftly in recent years. Lowe's \"Family Trees\" were renamed \"Christmas Trees,\" while Walmart's \"Holiday Shop\" is now a \"Christmas Shop.\" Midway through the 2005 holiday season, Target, facing a boycott, announced its advertising messages would become more specific and include references to Christmas. And last year, Gap Inc. responded to a boycott by issuing a press release highlighting the use of the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" in its upcoming Old Navy ads. \n \n Mr. Sharp stopped short of saying that he was surprised by how quickly and readily most retailers have changed their marketing. But he did point out that, especially in this type of economic environment, retailers are being careful not to alienate customers. \n \n \"Shoppers vote with their wallets every day,\" said Ellen Davis, a VP at the National Retail Federation. \"[When it comes to boycotts,] retailers realize, 'It could just as easily have been us.'\" \n \n The NRF does not formally advise retailers on whether they should use the word Christmas, but Ms. Davis said it does provide statistics. This year's NRF/BigResearch survey found that 91% of consumers plan to celebrate Christmas, compared with 5% for Hanukkah and 2% for Kwanzaa. \n \n \"Retailers dipped their toe into the Christmas waters again last year, and there wasn't much push back. There wasn't a huge outcry from groups offended that retailers were saying Merry Christmas,\" said Ms. Davis. \"We see the word Christmas being used much more this year than three or four years ago. The pendulum seems to have swung back.\" \n \n The \"extreme backlash\" to generic holiday messaging likely caught retailers off guard in years past, Ms. Davis added. Now, phrasing around the holidays is much more strategic. \"At this point, it's a conscious decision. It's not just whimsical phrases being tossed around in the marketing department,\" she said. \"These are conversations that are now probably taking place in the C-Suite.\" \n \n Retailers certainly tread carefully when it comes to the subject of Christmas. Major retailers such as JCPenney and Target said they don't have formal policies on in-store greetings. And retailers ranging from Gap to Macy's and RadioShack to Sears emphasized their inclusion and respect for shoppers of different beliefs, while noting that at least some of their marketing messages include the word Christmas. RadioShack, however, still appears on the AFA's list of \"Companies Against Christmas.\" A RadioShack spokesman declined to comment on that distinction. \n \n Plenty view the tactics of the AFA and other groups as bullying, but Mr. Sharp rejects that. \"It's not bullying, it's consumer advocacy,\" he said. The AFA's stance is that retailers should not profit from Christmas, if they refuse to clearly acknowledge it. \"When your advertising has trees and ornaments and gift wrapping, you're advertising Christmas, so don't call it holiday,\" Mr. Sharp said, adding that the group is not at all offended by Happy Hanukkah messages. \n \n AFA's Naughty or Nice List* \n \n *Incomplete list, click here for complete list. \n \n Companies for Christmas \n \n Company uses term \"Christmas\" on a regular basis. \n \n Amazon \n \n Best Buy \n \n Cabella's \n \n JCPenney \n \n Kmart \n \n Kohl's \n \n Lowe's \n \n Macy's \n \n Nordstrom \n \n Petsmart \n \n Sears \n \n Target \n \n Walmart \n \n Companies Marginalizing Christmas \n \n Company refers to \"Christmas\" infrequently or in a single advertising medium. \n \n Banana Republic \n \n Gap \n \n Old Navy \n \n Limited Brands \n \n Starbucks \n \n Toys R Us \n \n Whole Foods \n \n Companies Against Christmas \n \n Company may use \"Christmas\" sparingly in a single or unique product description. ||||| Naughty or Nice? \n \n AFA's 2012 listing of top retailers and how they recognize Christmas \n \n Color Code: \n \n BLUE : An AFA \"5-Star\" rated company that promotes and celebrates Christmas on an exceptional basis. \n \n GREEN : Company uses the term \"Christmas\" on a regular basis, we consider that company Christmas-friendly. \n \n YELLOW : Company refers to Christmas infrequently, or in a single advertising medium, but not in others. \n \n RED : Company may use \"Christmas\" sparingly in a single or unique product description, but as a company, does not recognize it. \n \n List updated on 11-12-12 \n \n Companies For \"Christmas\" AFA Online Store \n \n ACE Hardware \n \n Amazon.com \n \n Bass Pro Shops \n \n Bed Bath & Beyond \n \n Belk \n \n Best Buy \n \n Big Lots \n \n Books-A-Million \n \n Cabella's \n \n Collective Brands \n \n Costco \n \n CVS Pharmacy \n \n Dick's Sporting Goods \n \n Dilliards \n \n Dollar General \n \n Dollar Tree \n \n H.E.B.

If a company's ad has references to items associated with Christmas (trees, wreaths, lights, etc.), it was considered as an attempt to reach \"Christmas\" shoppers. \n \n If a company has items associated with Christmas, but did not use the word \"Christmas,\" then the company is considered as censoring \"Christmas.\" \n \n Want to report on a company? Send your detailed report to christmas@afa.net. Please know that we receive hundreds of reports (emails) each day. We are unable to respond to each one personally, but your report will be read by one of our staff. \n \n Note: AFA does not list local or regional companies.

    "document": "BENSALEM, Pa. (CBS) \u2014 Several multi-vehicles crashes, involving as many as 100 cars and dozens of tractor-trailers stretched over several miles of icy highway, shut down the Pennsylvania Turnpike for most of the day today between Willow Grove and Bensalem, Pa. \n \n One crash area involved approximately 75 cars and several tractor-trailers in the eastbound lanes of the highway. The westbound lanes were closed to allow access by emergency vehicles. \n \n According to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 30 people were injured and transported to local hospitals. Doylestown Hospital confirmed it was treating one victim who was in stable condition, while Abington was reportedly treating 16 people. St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center, in Langhorne, was treating seven and Temple University Hospital was treating one. CBS 3 is told five of the injuries are classified as serious, but none are considered life-threatening. \n \n Dr. John Kelly, chief of staff at Abington, says the good news is none of the injuries are serious. \n \n \u201cThe word that we have is that we may have seen the most severely injured at this point in time, which we\u2019re pleased to say did not include any life-threatening injuries that we are aware of.\u201d \n \n Kelly explained what kind of injuries they were seeing, \u201cIn a blunt trauma situation, you\u2019re going to have a lot of soft tissue and bone type injuries. I\u2019m unaware of any fractures to date. We did have one patient who had a closed- head injury but appears to be recovering well from that.\u201d \n \n The incident began about 8:30am in the eastbound lanes between Willow Grove and the Route 1 exits in Bensalem, Pa. \n \n Another crash happened closer to the Route 1 exit. That accident area involved approximately 30 cars and included a jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n Chopper 3 was over the scene where it appeared at least four cars were stuck under the jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n \u201cWe believe that it looks like at this point that the initial incident involved several tractor-trailer trucks. There have been reports of three to four. State police are working through sorting all that out right now,\u201d Carl DeFebo of the Pa.

Up to 50 cars were involved in those pileups. \n \n Here's what we know: \n \n The crashes on Interstate 276 were first reported just after 8 a.m. right in the middle of the morning rush, closing the turnpike between Willow Grove and the Philadelphia Interchanges in Bensalem; \n \n A total of 27 people were taken to hospitals, at least four of them with serious injuries; \n \n Drivers say the roadway was icy and incredibly slick. \n \n From the air, the long scene looked like an auto junkyard with dozens and dozens of cars and trucks scattered every which way. \n \n Drivers caught in the middle of the wreckage told us traffic had been moving smoothly at 50 to 55 mph until suddenly, \"All we saw was brake lights. Everybody locked up their wheels, and next thing you know the sun glare, the spray from the road, everything hit us all at once,\" said Bill Warrin, of Broomall, Pa. \n \n \"It was like a perfect storm, and then boom,\" he added. \n \n At the front of dozens of separate wrecks were two 18-wheelers, a box truck and several passenger cars. \n \n This stretch of the turnpike is three tight lanes, a wall of snow on one side, a concrete median Jersey barrier on the other. \n \n When cars ahead began to crash, there was no way to avoid impact. \n \n From the ground it was clear there was plenty of hard, packed ice on the road surface, a reminder of our massive snowstorm that lasted Wednesday night into Friday morning. \n \n But drivers told us conditions were deceiving. \n \n \"It was much icier once you got out of the car than you expected it to be,\" said Frank Atkinson, of Furlong, Pa. \"It seemed like it was slushy maybe, but it didn't seem like it was icy.\" \n \n The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission had lifted its storm-related speed limit and ban on some commercial vehicles just two hours before the crash. \n \n But a spokesman said that decision does not let drivers off the hook. \n \n \"It boils down to responsibility of motorists,\" turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said. \"That's our job when we're driving on the roads to monitor the conditions and to be sure that we are adjusting our speeds that are appropriate to whatever the driving conditions are.\" \n \n By early afternoon, a parade of flat-bed tow trucks was removing vehicles caught in the mess. \n \n The extent of the damage was a reminder that the injury toll could have been much higher, FOX 29's Bruce Gordon reported. \n \n In the second video clip above, FOX 29's Thalia Perez reports that all but one of the injured persons taken to Abington Memorial Hospital had been treated and released by Friday night.

    "document": "Hawaii conservationists are concerned that cat feces from feral colonies are washing into the ocean and imperiling monk seals, one of the world's most endangered marine mammals. \n \n Cats are shown eating at a feral cat colony near Honolulu on Thursday, Sept. 15, 2016. Conservationists are concerned about the number of feral cats roaming Hawaii because cat feces washing into the ocean can be deadly for endangered Hawaiian monk seals. \n \n Hawaii's stray cat population lies at the center of a heated debate between two camps of animal lovers in the Aloha State. On one side are conservationists who are calling to euthanize some of the hundreds of thousands of feral cats whose feces are thought to be spreading a disease that is killing Hawaiian monk seals. These marine mammals are among the most endangered in the world. \n \n On the other side of the debate are cat lovers who take issue with killing one animal for the sake of another. \n \n \"It's a very difficult, emotional issue,\" said state Sen. Mike Gabbard, chairman of a committee that earlier this year proposed a ban on feeding stray cats on state land. The proposal was abandoned after strong objections. \"It struck a nerve in our community,\" Senator Gabbard said. \n \n Hawaii is facing an explosion of stray cats, as they have no predators in the state. By the 2015 estimates of the Hawaiian Humane Society, there are about 300,000 feral cats on the island of Oahu alone. The problem is that the cats carry a common bacterial parasite that, they say, threatens the seals. The same bacteria is thought to have killed California sea otters, and is largely responsible for the extinction of the Hawaiian crow, the \u02bbalal\u0101, in the wild. \n \n The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that these toxic cat feces have killed eight Hawaiian monk seals since 2001, five females and three males, who have ingested contaminated water or prey. \n \n \"While eight seals may not sound like a lot of animals, it actually has pretty large ramifications for an endangered population where there's only about 1,300 seals in existence,\" said Michelle Barbieri, a veterinary medical officer for NOAA's Hawaiian monk seal research program. \n \n Since cats are not native to Hawaii \u2013 they were brought in \u2013 the NOAA program is pushing for a way to shrink their population, either through adoption or through what a NOAA coordinator describes as \"humane euthanization.\" \n \n \"As conservationists, what we really have to look at is this is what Hawaii's native ecosystem includes, and cats are unfortunately not part of that,\" said Angela Amlin, NOAA's acting Hawaiian monk seal recovery coordinator. \n \n That doesn\u2019t mean Hawaii should kill cats, say animal welfare advocates. In a response to the state Senate bill, Hawaiian Humane Society President and chief executive Pamela Burns wrote that she opposes a \"hierarchy in which the protection of certain animals comes at the suffering of others.\" \n \n She and other animal welfare advocates decry euthanasia for healthy felines. \"What we ... don't advocate is the wholesale killing, the extermination, of one species\" for another, said Alicia Maluafiti, the board president of animal welfare group Poi Dogs and Popoki. \n \n Trapping, neutering, and spaying to help control the cat population are reasonable solutions to the problem, say cat supporters. \n \n This report uses material from the Associated Press. ||||| Hoku endured some rough days before he died last spring. Three dogs chased him off one of his resting beaches, and he battled a minor tsunami that left him wedged between a pair of boulders in a lava field far from shore. \n \n Observers noticed him looking thin in the few months before fishermen found him dead on a beach near the east Kaua`i town of Kapa`a. \n \n In the end, disease took him. \n \n Nicknamed \u201cStar\u201d in Hawaiian for the small white spot on his forehead, Hoku was a large, 10-year-old Hawaiian monk seal, an endangered species. \n \n Hoku may likely have been the second Hawaiian monk seal to die this year from Toxoplasmosa gondii, a parasite transmitted primarily through cat feces and carried to the ocean in polluted runoff and sewage. \n \n The first suspected toxoplasmosis case of the year came in January. While conducting his weekly seal search along the coastline of Moloka`i\u2019s Kalaupapa National Historical Park, marine ecologist Eric Brown discovered a stillborn pup in a tide pool. His mother, apparently in good health, lay nearby. \n \n David Schofield, marine mammal response coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Pacific Islands Regional Office, believes the pup may have been the first Hawaiian monk seal to die from a toxoplasmosis infection transmitted in the womb. \n \n With only about 1,100 monk seals left in the wild, the deaths are \u201cvery concerning and put toxo as one of our primary concerns\u201d for the species, says Charles Littnan, lead scientist for NOAA\u2019s monk seal research program. \n \n The overall population of monk seals is declining at a rate of about 4.5 percent a year. The good news is that in recent years, their numbers have been growing in the main Hawaiian islands. Now resource managers worry that in the midst of so many humans, interactions will likely increase, as will the seals\u2019 chances of encountering diseases and contaminants. \n \n No studies have been done in Hawai`i on how and where toxoplasmosis reaches the ocean and there are few efforts to control it. In California, however, researchers have found that it infects sea otters mainly though runoff from urban areas. \n \n Flushing cat litter down the toilet is one pathway, since sewage treatment does not always kill the parasite\u2019s hardy eggs, called oocysts. Studies have found that oocysts can live for at least two years in sea water. \n \n Over the past ten years, the cat parasite has killed at least four monk seals in the main Hawaiian islands - two from Kaua`i, one from O`ahu, and one from Moloka`i - and perhaps six, experts estimate. \n \n Those deaths \u201cshould be considered an absolute minimum since there are dead seals we never know about and ones we sample but are unable to determine a cause of death for,\u201d Littnan said. \n \n \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand the prevalence of the disease in the population and determine ways to mitigate the impact.\u201d \n \n Hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, the Hawaiian monk seal was federally listed as endangered in 1976, after populations plummeted during the 1960s and 1970s, largely due to military disturbance. \n \n Today, it is considered the most endangered pinniped in the United States. With a potential peak population of about 3,000 seals, NOAA predicts numbers will drop below 1,000 in the next few years. \n \n The population\u2019s core has long been in the remote, largely uninhabited Northwest Hawaiian Islands, but more and more, conditions there are killing them. Low juvenile survival due to starvation is by far the biggest problem facing monk seals. Some researchers speculate that overfishing may have caused a shift in predator dominance that is now making it nearly impossible for young seals to compete for food. \n \n But diseased cats also are among the seals\u2019 worst enemies, since their feces flow into the ocean via runoff and sewage. \n \n The state Division of Forestry and Wildlife estimates that 300,000 to 400,000 free-ranging cats live on Maui alone. That\u2019s roughly two cats per resident. \n \n \u201cCats are all over the place in Hawai`i,\u201d explains Thierry Work, a wildlife disease specialist with the Geological Survey\u2019s Honolulu field station who studied toxoplasmosis in Hawaiian crows, known as `alala, about a decade ago. \u201cWherever there are cats, there\u2019s the potential for toxoplasmosis.\u201d \n \n Although domestic cats are considered the main source, feral cats in remote areas also transmit the disease. Nearly 40 percent of 67 cats captured from the slopes of Mauna Kea, on the island of Hawai`i, tested positive for toxoplasmosis, according to a 2007 article in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases. \n \n In the past decade or so, toxoplasmosis has been regularly found in a wide range of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins and sea lions. In Hawa`i, it also has killed seabirds and endangered Hawaiian crow and geese. \n \n Perhaps most famously, southern sea otters in California began dying off in alarming numbers in the 1990s. Toxoplasmosis was found in 52 percent of fresh, beach-cast otter carcasses and 38 percent of live otters sampled along the California coast, according to a 2005 International Journal of Parasitology article. \n \n In Hawa`i, it also has killed seabirds and endangered Hawaiian crow and geese.Whether the increased diagnoses indicate improved testing techniques or a rise in disease prevalence is difficult to determine. \n \n \u201cProbably both things are at play and it\u2019s going to be awfully hard to tease those out,\u201d says Scott Wright of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s National Wildlife Health Center. \n \n Sometimes a pathogen is discovered in a species and it\u2019s unclear what it means in terms of the disease moving through a population, he says. \u201cIn some cases, circumstances change and the disease takes hold and causes a problem and other times it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \n \n For some seals, determining a cause of death is impossible since they are often highly decomposed when discovered. \n \n \u201cIf we\u2019re not there within 24 to 48 hours, the insides of the seal are soup,\u201d Littnan says. \n \n But even when his team confirms the presence of T. gondii, that doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate an infection, let alone a fatal one. So, in addition to hunting for the pathogen, his team looks for signs, such as swelling of the brain, lymph nodes, or lungs, that are typical of toxoplasmosis. \n \n Hoku, an up-and-coming dominant male, died of \u201csevere meningoencephalitis caused by a protozoan,\u201d Littnan says. Although toxoplasmosis is suspected, it has not yet been confirmed as the culprit. He notes that only Hoku\u2019s brain was inflamed but not other organs that toxoplasmosis has a predilection for. This suggests that the parasite was \u201cinactive for a long period,\u201d he says, \u201cbut some event, such as immune suppression, may have led to activation. At this point, the findings are speculative until all the results come back.\u201d \n \n Hoku visited an area known as Salt Ponds four times in the six months before he died. There are well-known, and well-fed, feral cat populations there and at Kalaupapa National Historic Park. But Littnan says seals \u201cmove across a pretty large range. It\u2019s hard to trace it back to where they were likely exposed.\u201d \n \n Throughout most of Hawai`I, water quality in surface waters ranges from \u201cslightly impaired to severely impaired\u201d by pathogens and pollutants, according to a state assessment. In particular, runoff from densely populated watersheds on Maui and O`ahu likely contains pathogens, according to the state\u2019s polluted runoff control implementation plan. \n \n Sewage is also a significant source of pathogens as tropical storms overwhelm aging transmission pipes and inadequate treatment systems. What\u2019s more, injection wells on Maui have created giant wastewater plumes at some popular beaches. \n \n Cat feces also contaminate livestock. A study of pig farms on O`ahu found that nearly half of more than 500 pigs tested positive for toxoplasmosis. Most rivers that flow to the ocean traverse through an agricultural site, according to a 2006 EcoHealth article by Littnan and researchers from NOAA and the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute. \n \n Although the state doesn\u2019t test for toxoplasmosis, the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s Testing the Waters 2010 report provides some insight into the role runoff plays in pathogen transmission in Hawai`i. Storm water was responsible for 99 percent of beach closures/advisories in 2009. Sewage spills accounted for the remaining one percent. Kaua`i beaches exceeded daily maximum bacterial standards most often. \n \n According to the EcoHealth article, nearly 30 million gallons of sewage were spilled between 2000 and 2004. That number was exceeded in a matter of days in 2005, when a broken main caused the city of Honolulu to divert 48 million gallons of raw sewage into Waikiki\u2019s Ala Wai canal. \n \n In addition to toxoplasmosis, other pathogens have infected monk seals. \n \n A few years ago, Littnan, NOAA contract veterinarian Robert Braun, and Brent Stewart and Pamela Yochem of the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute tested seals for pathogens while trying to assess the disease threat.Their results, published in EcoHealth, suggest that seals encounter a variety of pathogens, including Sarcocystis neurona and Neospora caninum, as well as T. gondii. S. neurona causes equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, which creates lesions on the spinal cord and brain stem. Neosporosis can cause abortions in cattle and neuromuscular degeneration in dogs. \n \n Leptospirosis is among the biggest concerns. Suspected in the death of two pups born near a stream mouth on the island of Hawai`I, it is mainly transmitted through contact with surface water contaminated with infected rodent or mongoose urine. \n \n Although there is limited data on leptospirosis prevalence in Hawai`i, it\u2019s considered ubiquitous. The reported incidence rate among people in Hawai`i (1.29 cases per 100,000 persons) is about 30 times the national rate, with the highest rates on Kaua`i and Hawai`i islands. \n \n In another effort to gauge threats, Hawai`i Pacific University graduate student Jessica Lopez is evaluating 77 industrial chemicals and pesticides found in about 60 monk seals over the past decade. \n \n \u201cWe don't know anything about what levels can cause an effect in monk seals, whether lethal or sub-lethal, so it will be difficult to speak to whether the levels measured are \u2018safe\u2019 or not,\u201d she says. \n \n Lopez also plans to evaluate seal movements and locations of sewage outflows and agricultural and industrial complexes to determine high risk areas that may factor into decisions on managing the seals. \n \n For Littnan, filling data gaps is his top priority, such as tracking the mother of January\u2019s stillborn pup to see if she has signs of infection. \n \n \u201cIt would be very interesting to learn more about seals that [test positive for toxoplasmosis] but are not showing any clinical signs,\u201d he said. \n \n If the mother tests positive, drugs might be available for treatment. NOAA is partnering with California\u2019s Marine Mammal Center to build a monk seal hospital in Kona. \n \n To raise public awareness about toxoplasmosis and cat feces, NOAA has begun talking with the Hawai`i Humane Society, various interest groups and the health department. \n \n But given his experience with Hawaiian birds, Work of the U.S. Geological Survey says generating the political will to control cats is \u201cvery difficult.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe `alala is a classic case in point,\u201d Work says. Ten years ago, toxoplasmosis was identified as a threat at a national wildlife refuge in Kona that was created for the birds. Yet today, the cats remain at the refuge, while the `alala have been extirpated from the area. \n \n Scientists are concerned about the role the disease may play in the seals\u2019 recovery. \n \n Under NOAA\u2019s recovery plan, the population must grow from the current 1,100 to a minimum of 2,900 before it can be downlisted to threatened. In a recent article, NOAA scientists stated that \u201cfishery interactions, direct killing, and disease could rapidly undo the current fragile positive trend\u201d on the main islands. \n \n \u201cThe greatest need for seals right now is fostering the co-existence of seals and people. That\u2019s the most immediate threat to population growth in the main Hawaiian islands,\u201d Littnan says. Compounding the threat, \u201ctoxo and lepto will be there and will probably continue to operate in a background level.\u201d",

That's because cat poop often contains a parasite called Toxoplasmosa gondii, and when sewage and polluted runoff carry the infected feces to the ocean, it can prove lethal, reports Scientific American. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that eight Hawaiian monk seals have succumbed to the disease since 2001, which is a sizable number given that 1,100 are estimated to be alive today in the wild. The same bacteria have also killed California sea otters and helped send the Hawaiian crow into extinction, reports the Christian Science Monitor. But while conservationists call for the \"humane euthanization\" of some feral cats, animal welfare advocates oppose a \"hierarchy in which the protection of certain animals comes at the suffering of others,\" as the president of the Hawaiian Human Society puts it. Monk seals are considered the most endangered pinniped in the country, and their numbers are expected to dip below 1,000 soon, with starvation among the young the largest known problem. Meanwhile, Hawaii's Division of Forestry and Wildlife estimates that 300,000 feral cats live on Oahu and as many as 400,000 on Maui, which is roughly two cats per human resident.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that these toxic cat feces have killed eight Hawaiian monk seals since 2001, five females and three males, who have ingested contaminated water or prey, the Christian Science Monitor reports. \"While eight seals may not sound like a lot of animals, it actually has pretty large ramifications for an endangered population where there's only about 1,300 seals in existence,\" says Michelle Barbieri, a veterinary medical officer for NOAA's Hawaiian monk seal research program. Since cats are not native to Hawaii\u2014they were brought in\u2014the NOAA program is pushing for a way to shrink their population, either through adoption or through what a NOAA coordinator describes as \"humane euthanizing.\" But animal welfare advocates decry euthanasia for healthy felines. \"What we ... don't advocate is the wholesale killing, the extermination, of one species\" for another, says Alicia Maluafiti, the board president of animal welfare group Poi Dogs and Popoki. The debate is \"a very difficult, emotional issue,\" says state Sen.

The good news is that lead cat litter has been found to be a safe route to the ocean for monk seals, who have only about 1,100 left in the wild. \u2013 The Hawaiian monk seal is the most endangered pinniped in the US, and that could be about to change. The seal population is expected to drop below 1,000 in the next few years due to a number of factors, including overharvesting, habitat loss, and toxoplasmosis, a parasite carried by feral cats, National Geographic reports. Hawaiian monk seals were listed as an endangered species in 1976, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Today, there are believed to be only around 3,000 of the seals in existence. \"We are only just beginning to understand the prevalence of the disease in the population and determine ways to mitigate the impact,\" a US Geological Survey wildlife specialist tells National Geographic. It's been found in a wide range of marine mammals, including dolphins, whales, sea otters, and birds, including the Hawaiian crow whale and the southern beach-castotter in California. The parasite is carried by cats, and feral cats in remote areas have also been known to transmit the disease. \"If we're not there within an absolute minimum 48 hours, the insides of the monk seals are awfully soup,\" the wildlife specialist says. \u2013 A Hawaiian monk seal has died of leptospirosis, a disease caused by a parasite found in sewage. The 60-year-old male's brain was inflamed, but not other organs, which suggests the parasite was \"inactive for long period\" before he died, researcher Brent Stewart tells the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \"It's hard to trace it back to where they were likely exposed,\" he says. The cause of death isn't clear, but the monk seal's heart, liver, and spleen were found to be infected with the parasite, which can be passed to humans via urine, feces, or by contact with infected seals or other animals, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Stewart tested more than 50 seals for the disease, and found that almost half were infected. He says he's seen a rise in cases in recent years, but it's not clear what's behind the increase. \"We don't know anything about what pathogens there can cause or effect in seals, so it will be difficult to speak to whether the levels measured are sub-lethal or not,\" a researcher says. \u2013 The Hawaiian monk seal population has rebounded from the brink of extinction in the past three decades, but scientists are now concerned that the population could be in danger of disappearing altogether. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's monk seal recovery plan calls for the population to grow from the current 1,100 to a minimum of 2,900 before it can be downlisted to threatened. To do that, the population must grow from its current level of 1,100 to at least 2,900, reports the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. In a recent NOAA article, scientists noted that \"fishery interactions, direct killing, and disease could rapidly undo the current fragile positive trend\" on the main islands. \"The greatest need for seals right now is fostering the co-existence of seals and people,\" says a NOAA scientist. \"That's the most immediate threat to population growth in the main Hawaiian islands.\" That's because the seals need people to coexist, and \"toxo and lepto will be there and will probably continue to operate in a background level,\" he says. In addition to human feces, scientists are concerned about toxoplasmosis, which is spread by cats, and dog droppings, which are eaten by seals. \"We don't know anything about what levels can cause an",

That\u2019s up 46% from the 628 cases the year before, and up from 362 in 2013. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s just a systemic public health failure,\u201d David Harvey, the executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that this has come roaring back in the United States.\u201d \n \n The spike in the disease, known as congenital syphilis in infants, comes even as the US has come close to eliminating the transmission of HIV from mothers to children. \n \n The 918 cases last year included 64 babies who were stillborn, and 13 who died as infants. \n \n It is easily preventable: women who test positive for syphilis while pregnant can be treated and cured with penicillin, and won\u2019t pass the disease on to their babies. \n \n But some women never get tested, while others test negative but then contract the disease during their pregnancy. Left untreated, there\u2019s an 80% chance a woman will pass the disease on to her baby. \n \n \u201cWhen passed to a baby, syphilis can result in miscarriage, newborn death and severe lifelong physical and mental health problems,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Mermin of the CDC. \n \n \u201cNo parent should have to bear the death of a child when it would have been prevented with a simple test and safe treatment,\u201d Mermin said. \n \n The spike in infant cases comes amid a jump in syphilis infections overall \u2013 there were 30,644 diagnoses in 2017, a 76% increase from the previous year. \n \n Gay and bisexual men make up a large majority of people diagnosed with syphilis. But for the last five years, syphilis rates among women have been rising as well. \n \n The syphilis rate went up 143% among reproductive age women since 2013, according to the CDC, bringing with it a jump in babies born with the disease. \n \n Infants born with syphilis were reported in 37 states, with western and southern states the hardest hit. Louisiana had the highest rate of congenital syphilis of any state. \n \n Harvey said the increase reflects a failure to make sure women are tested for the disease at the correct times in their pregnancies, and a lack of access to prenatal care overall. \n \n The opioid epidemic has also contributed to the uptick, with women who use drugs more likely to engage in risky sex and less likely to get proper treatment. \n \n \u201cA small number of women are trading sex for drugs,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThere is a very real intersection between congenital syphilis and substance abuse.\u201d \n \n Total STD diagnoses have reached a record high \u2013 with nearly 2.3m cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis in 2017, according to the CDC\u2019s report. That\u2019s an increase of more than 200,000 cases from the previous year, and the fourth straight year there has been a sharp increase. \n \n \u201cNot that long ago, gonorrhea rates were at historic lows, syphilis was close to elimination, and we were able to point to advances in STD prevention,\u201d Dr Gail Bolan, the director of the division of STD prevention, said in the CDC\u2019s report. \u201cThat progress has since unraveled.\u201d \n \n The infections have surged as STD prevention funding has dwindled, and condom use has declined. \n \n Harvey is pushing the Trump administration and Congress to declare the issue a public health emergency. \n \n \u201cThis field is starved for resources.

(Photo: Orbon Alija, Getty Images) \n \n The number of babies born with syphilis has more than doubled since 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a trend that medical professionals said shows the need to be vigilant about testing and treating the rare but potentially disease. \n \n The number of babies born with syphilis rose from 362 in 2013 to 918 in 2017, the CDC reported Tuesday. The greatest number of cases were in the South and West. \n \n Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is easily cured with penicillin. But women with untreated syphilis can pass it on to their fetuses during pregnancy or to their babies during birth. \n \n If transmitted, it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or newborn death. Syphilis caused 77 stillbirths or newborn deaths in 2017, the CDC reported. \n \n For babies who survive, it can lead to an assortment of physical and mental health problems. \n \n More: Sexually transmitted diseases surge for the 4th straight year, CDC reports \n \n More: STDs reach all-time high in California, leading to spike in stillbirths due to syphilis, state health authorities say \n \n More: Washing hands and other ways to protect newborns from deadly herpes virus \n \n David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the surge \"a systemic failure.\" \n \n \"We are failing pregnant women in the United States,\" he said. \"We are seeing almost 1,000 babies born with syphilis that can easily be prevented.\" \n \n The United States has made HIV transmission from mothers to newborns extremely rare, in part through the federal Ryan White Part D program, which funds community programs that provide care to pregnant women with HIV. \n \n Harvey's organization wants a similar program to prevent the mother-to-newborn transmission of syphilis. Harvey said pregnant women should be tested for syphilis as early as possible and later in their pregnancies. \n \n According to the CDC, mothers of one in three babies born with syphilis in 2016 were tested during pregnancy. But they were either infected after getting tested, or they were not treated in time to prevent passing the infection to the baby. \n \n Thirty-seven states reported cases in 2017. Louisiana ranked first with 93.4 cases for every 100,000 births. \n \n \"We're not proud of these numbers,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health. \"Every case of syphilis should be preventable.\" \n \n Gee said Louisiana has worked to reduce the number of new cases. \n \n The state examines every case of newborn syphilis to lean steps that could prevent future cases, she said. One trend they discovered was moms who initially tested negative for the infection or were treated in their first trimesters contracted syphilis during later stages of pregnancy. \n \n Louisiana requires doctors test pregnant women for both syphilis and HIV in the first and third trimesters. \n \n The health department has also assigned case managers to Baton Rouge and Shreveport, the two regions with the highest number of cases. They work to raise awareness among doctors about the need to test. \n \n Case managers and doctors also warn pregnant moms who have been tested or treated that they can contract the infection again, said DeAnn Gruber, the department's director of infectious diseases. \n \n \"Education is really important,\" Gruber said. \n \n The Arizona health department's newly formed maternal morbidity review board identified congenital syphilis as a growing problem. \n \n Arizona's 36 cases so far in 2018 already have surpassed last year's total, state health officials said. Six babies have died at or shortly after birth this year. \n \n California had the most cases of congenital syphilis in the nation, and the third highest rate, according to the CDC. \n \n One of the state's biggest challenges is reaching people who don't have access to prenatal care, said Heidi Bauer, chief of STD control for the California Department of Public Health. \n \n Bauer said common barriers are poverty and unstable housing. Some moms are struggling with substance abuse, and may avoid drug testing or interaction with government agencies such as Child Protective Services. \n \n California public health officials have attempted to reach out to at-risk people through needle exchanges and in prisons, Bauer said. \n \n \"Syphilis is one of those ancient diseases that tends to reemerge where people are largely marginalized,\" Bauer said. \n \n Preliminary figures reported by the CDC last month showed new cases of the most common treatable sexually transmitted diseases \u2013 chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis \u2013 spiked nearly 10 percent in 2017 to an all-time high. \n \n These infectious diseases have continued a four-year climb.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Tracy Connor \n \n A day after NBC News reported that none of the corroded lead pipes at the core of the Flint water crisis have been removed, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder admitted he has no immediate plans to replace them. \n \n NBC News correspondent Stephanie Gosk repeatedly pressed the embattled governor Wednesday on how he expects to win the trust of Flint's residents while the pipes that poisoned the water supply are still being used. \n \n \"There absolutely is a trust issue,\" Snyder conceded. \n \n But he said that removing the pipes \u2014 which experts have told NBC News is the only permanent solution to the lead problem \u2014 isn't on his \"short-term\" agenda. \n \n \"It's a lot of work to take out pipes, to redo all of the infrastructure, that's a whole planning process,\" Snyder said at a press conference. \n \n Instead, he said, the state is focusing on using phosphates in the water to coat the corroded pipes and keep the lead from leaching out. \n \n Gosk asked him, \"If you don't replace those pipes, a lot of people tell us they're simply not going to drink the water no matter how many assurance they're getting. How do you address that right now?\" \n \n The governor said the state would be using \"third-party expertise\" to assess whether the phosphates were working and address public fears. \n \n There are up to 25,000 service lines containing lead that run between water mains and homes in Flint. Starting in April 2014, water from the Flint River corroded the pipes, leaching toxins into the tap water. \n \n Related: What Emergency? Lead Pipes Not Being Removed in Flint \n \n The city is no longer using the river water, but the damaged pipes are still a threat and the entire city is relying on bottled and filtered water for drinking, cooking and even bathing in some cases. \n \n Flint Mayor Karen Weaver told MSNBC on Wednesday morning that pipe replacement is \"the first thing\" the government needs to address. \n \n \"That\u2019s what the citizens of Flint deserve,\" she said. \"Nobody\u2019s going to trust the water if we don\u2019t do that.\" \n \n But Snyder said the state's not ready for that. \n \n \"A lot of work is being done to even understand where the lead service lines even are,\" he said. ||||| FLINT, Mich. - Flint Mayor Karen Weaver says plans are in the works to replace all of the city's lead pipes. \n \n \u201cAll lead pipes need to be replaced,\" Weaver told reporters Tuesday at a press conference. \"We deserve new pipes because we did not deserve what happened.\" \n \n Weaver said the project will cost an estimated $55 million, and will replace 15,000 lines.

Here's what you need to know about how the public health crisis has evolved. VPC \n \n Buy Photo Flint Mayor Karen Weaver (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo \n \n Flint Mayor Karen Weaver on Tuesday outlined an estimated $55-million public works project expected to begin within a month to remove Flint's lead-contaminated pipes from the water distribution system. \n \n First priority will be given to high-risk households with pregnant women and children, Weaver said at a news conference at City Hall. \n \n \"In order for Flint residents to once again have confidence and trust in the water coming from their faucets, all lead pipes in the city of Flint need to be replaced,\" she said. \"The success of the Fast Start plan will require coordination between the city, state and federal officials as well as funding from the Michigan Legislature, Congress or both. I'm asking Gov. Snyder and the state to partner on this effort. \n \n \"We\u2019ll let the investigations determine who's to blame for Flint's water crisis, but I'm focused on solving it. It's going to take time to get this done, but we\u2019re going to move quickly to get this done.\" \n \n Last week, Weaver called for the immediate removal of the city's lead-contaminated pipes and announced a plan that included help from Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, who has offered technical assistance from the Lansing Board of Water and Light. Lansing has removed about 13,500 lead pipes in the city. \n \n The Fast Start plan will require extensive coordination between city, state and federal officials, Weaver said. She was joined Tuesday by retired National Guard Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, who said he thinks the project can be done within a year by 32 crews. \n \n McDaniel \u2014 who is assisting in coordinating activities between the city, the Lansing Board of Water and Light, state and federal agencies, and other stakeholders -- said the project could begin within the next month. But McDaniel reiterated the plan is still in its early phases and much of it is based on \"assumptions.\" \n \n \"We are trying to balance urgency with precision,\" McDaniel said. \"We have made a number of assumptions in our plan, is what I'm saying, because we had to make those. We do not have all the data we would like to have, but we do know enough based on the assumptions we had to make to go forward.\" \n \n The preliminary project scope developed by the BWL shows that up to 15,000 lead pipes could be removed in one year \"under optimal conditions,\" Weaver said. \n \n McDaniel noted that while it took the BWL 10 years to remove 13,500 pipes, he thinks they can move quicker in Flint because they've perfected the process. McDaniel and Weaver said Flint crews would also be involved in the project. \n \n \"We are in the process of reaching out to the state for their assistance of the data and of the planning itself with funding, as Mayor Weaver also said,\" McDaniel said. \"We are developing a detailed time line. I cannot tell you we will put a shovel in the ground tomorrow, but I will tell you that we will do it very soon. ... When we say replace those lines, we mean the entire line from the main to the meter.\" \n \n The project would be done in two phases, with the first targeting high-risk households of children under the age of 6, children with elevated blood-lead levels, pregnant women, senior citizens, residential day care facilities, people with compromised immune systems and households where water tests indicate high levels of lead at the tap. \n \n The project will not immediately address schools, businesses and other locations in Flint, according to a document released by the city detailing the plan. The city said most large facilities are served by \"high-capacity cast iron water services,\" and not the typical lines found in residential water services. \n \n \"Eliminating lead components from the entire water distribution system and from inside homes and buildings is a longer-term project that will require additional planning and additional resources,\" the document states. \"For institutional entities like schools and businesses, bottled water can continue to provide for their short-term needs.\" \n \n Buy Photo (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) \n \n McDaniel and Weaver declined to say where exactly in the city the project would begin. \n \n Phase two of the program would ramp up to a \"full-scale operation\" that would bring in 32 crews and a \"robust administration and logistics support team to meet the one-year goal,\" Weaver said. \n \n McDaniel said the costs in the projected $55-million effort could fluctuate because of the architecture and condition of the water distribution system. The estimated cost per line is $3,670, according to a city document. Of the $55 million, about $1.5 million will go toward administration and logistics, according to the city, which said personnel costs are estimated at $900,000 and operations costs are projected to be $600,000. According to the city, the bulk of the cost \u2014 $36 million \u2014 will go toward the labor and about $9.7 million will go toward the materials. \n \n According to the city, the Fast Start program will remove and replace the lines at no cost to the homeowner. However, homeowners will be required to sign an agreement that authorizes Flint to remove and replace the portions of the lines on their private property and allow access to the meter inside the home. \n \n Lead lines will be replaced with new copper lines and a water filter will be installed at the kitchen tap for three months as a precaution, city officials said. \n \n Flint's drinking water became contaminated with lead in April 2014 after the city, while under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager, switched its source to the Flint River as a temporary cost-cutting move and the state Department of Environmental Quality failed to require the addition of needed corrosion-control chemicals. As a result, corrosive water caused lead to leach from pipes, joints and fixtures, causing many citizens to receive water with unsafe lead levels. The state has told residents not to drink the water without filtering and says it is treating all Flint children as having been exposed to unsafe levels of lead. \n \n The FBI is now investigating the contamination of Flint\u2019s drinking water amid a growing public outcry. U.S. Rep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Township, proposed an emergency $1-billion grant to be authorized through the Environmental Protection Agency, and two Democratic U.S. senators and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, proposed up to $400 million in dollar-for-dollar matching funds from the state to do much the same thing. \n \n The U.S. Attorney's Office announced Jan. 5 that it was assisting the EPA in the investigation and Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman, said federal prosecutors are \u201cworking with a multi-agency investigation team on the Flint water contamination matter, including the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, EPA's Office of Inspector General, and EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.\" \n \n Several lawsuits have been filed in connection with the crisis. \n \n On Monday, the family of a 2-year-old girl whose blood test results showed the toddler suffers from lead poisoning, announced an individual suit against Gov. Rick Snyder, former Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley, former Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and several other state and Flint officials. \n \n When asked at the news conference whether she thinks Snyder will support the plan, Weaver said the city can no longer afford to wait. \n \n \"We\u2019re putting forward our plan and we cannot wait for that,\" Weaver said. \"We don\u2019t trust that and we deserve new pipes. That\u2019s the only way this community is going to be confident and people will stay here and people will come. I cannot imagine that he would not support this plan. If he doesn\u2019t, shame on him.\" \n \n Contact Katrease Stafford: 313-223-4759 or kstafford@freepress.com \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1Xg7zin",

    "document": "LEIDEN, Netherlands, Dec. 17 (UPI) -- People who love horror movies often say they enjoy the unexpected adrenaline rush of gruesome, surprising scenes often described by critics and fans alike as \"bloodcurdling,\" a metaphor that may have more truth to it than previously thought. \n \n Researchers at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands tested the physiological effects of horror movies on a group of volunteers, finding fear inspired by a horror movie increased levels of clotting agents in viewers' blood. \n \n While they said this doesn't mean people's veins will start clogging while binging on the Freddy Krueger or the Saw movie series, it does mean the term is somewhat literal. \n \n \"For centuries the term \"bloodcurdling\" has been used to describe feeling extreme fear under frightening situations,\" researchers wrote in the study, published in the British Medical Journal. \"The term dates back to medieval times and is based on the concept that fear or horror would 'run the blood cold' or 'curdle' [congeal] blood.\" \n \n The researchers recruited 24 healthy volunteers from the hospital under age 30, showing 14 the movie Insidious and then a documentary called A Year in Champagne separated by a week, while the other 10 were shown both movies a week apart in the reverse order. The researchers took blood samples from each participant 15 minutes before and after watching each movie. \n \n Insidious was expectedly found more frightening by viewers than the documentary, and levels of coagulating factor VIII increased in 57 percent of participants, as opposed to just 14 percent of participants' levels going up during A Year in Champagne. During the documentary, 86 percent of the participants' levels decreased, compared to 43 percent during the horror movie. \n \n The researchers said they think the increase in the clotting factor is the body preparing to heal itself as a physical response to fear -- if a person is running from an animal attack but is caught, the body's preparation could help stop bleeding faster, they explained. \n \n \"We suspected that fear might speed clotting in the blood,\" said Nemeth Banne, a researcher at Leiden University Medical Center, in a press release. \"Damaged tissue gives off tissue factor, which triggers the coagulation really, but that's probably faster if there are more clotting factors in the blood.\" ||||| Scary movies really are blood-curdling, Dutch researchers have found. \n \n That frisson of fear releases a little bit of the blood-clotting protein called Factor VIII, they report. \n \n The team at Leiden University Medical Center studied 24 healthy volunteers ages 30 and younger. \n \n \"One group (of 14) were assigned to watch the horror movie 'Insidious' followed by the documentary 'A Year in Champagne,'\" Dr. Banne Nemeth and colleagues report in the lighthearted holiday issue of the British Medical Journal. \n \n \"The other group watched the movies in reverse order.\" \n \n Blood samples were taken before and after and each volunteer rated the 90-minute-long films. \n \n The horror movie was, not surprisingly, scarier than the educational movie, they found. And Factor VIII levels changed, going up in 57 percent of the volunteers during the horror move and falling in 86 percent when they watched the Champagne documentary. \n \n \"Exposure of young and healthy adults to horror movies was associated with an increase in coagulant factor VIII levels,\" Nemeth's team concluded. \n \n Other blood-clotting proteins weren't affected, no one suffered a blood clot and there is a simple cure, the researchers advised. \n \n \"A truly relaxing and merry Christmas, without exposure to frightening situations, seems to be advisable to prevent venous thrombosis,\" they wrote. ||||| Banne Nemeth , medical doctor 1 2, Luuk J J Scheres , medical doctor 1 3, Willem M Lijfering , postdoctoral researcher 1, Frits R Rosendaal , professor of clinical epidemiology 1 4 1Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, 2300 RC, Leiden, Netherlands 2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands 3Department of Vascular Medicine, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands 4Einthoven Laboratory for Experimental Vascular Medicine, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands Correspondence to: F R Rosendaal f.r.rosendaal{at}lumc.nl Accepted 13 November 2015 \n \n Abstract Objective To assess whether, as has been hypothesised since medieval times, acute fear can curdle blood.

Participants 24 healthy volunteers aged \u226430 years recruited among students, alumni, and employees of the Leiden University Medical Center: 14 were assigned to watch a frightening (horror) movie followed by a non-threatening (educational) movie and 10 to watch the movies in reverse order. The movies were viewed more than a week apart at the same time of day and both lasted approximately 90 minutes. Main outcome measures The primary outcome measures were markers, or \u201cfear factors\u201d of coagulation activity: blood coagulant factor VIII, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and prothrombin fragments 1+2. The secondary outcome was participant reported fear experienced during each movie using a visual analogue fear scale. Results All participants completed the study. The horror movie was perceived to be more frightening than the educational movie on a visual analogue fear scale (mean difference 5.4, 95% confidence interval 4.7 to 6.1). The difference in factor VIII levels before and after watching the movies was higher for the horror movie than for the educational movie (mean difference of differences 11.1 IU/dL (111 IU/L), 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 21.0 IU/dL). The effect of either movie on levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes, D-dimer, and prothrombin fragments 1+2 did not differ. Conclusion Frightening (in this case, horror) movies are associated with an increase of blood coagulant factor VIII without actual thrombin formation in young and healthy adults. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02601053. \n \n Introduction Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. Marie Curie, 1867-19341 For centuries the term \u201cbloodcurdling\u201d has been used to describe feeling extreme fear under frightening situations.2 Similar terms are used in other countries, such as \u201cdas blut in den Adern erstarrt\u201d in Germany, \u201c\u00e0 vous glacer le sang\u201d in France, and \u201cbloedstollend\u201d in the Netherlands. The term dates back to medieval times and is based on the concept that fear or horror would \u201crun the blood cold\u201d or \u201ccurdle\u201d (congeal) blood.3 The validity of this theory has, however, never been studied. Several studies have explored the effects of physical stress on the coagulation system.4 For example, chronic anxiety in patients with psychiatric disorders (and associated therapies which may influence blood coagulation) is associated with increased levels of coagulation markers,5 6 and increased coagulation activity has been observed in healthy volunteers after bungee jumping.7 Yet the effects of excitement and profound physical activity are not necessarily equal to those of acute fear, because, for example, actions such as bungee jumping are performed voluntarily and this was seen as deviating from an ideal study design.8 We investigated the effect of acute fear without physical exercise on markers of coagulation. We hypothesised that acute fear activates the coagulation system and that this poses an important evolutionary benefit, by preparing the body for blood loss during life threatening situations. \n \n Methods We recruited 24 healthy volunteers aged \u226430 years from among students, alumni, and employees of the Leiden University Medical Centre. We excluded those who were taking prescribed drugs, pregnant, using hormonal contraceptives, had a history of thrombosis, and had had surgery or been immobilised with a cast in the past two months. One group (n=14) were assigned to watch the horror movie Insidious (2010)9 (www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1929288729?ref_=tt_pv_vi_aiv_2) followed by the documentary A Year in Champagne (2014).10 The other group (n=10) watched the movies in reverse order (see supplementary file for authors\u2019 descriptions of these movies). As movie nights were set on specific dates, group allocation was based on availability of the participants. Each movie lasted approximately 90 minutes and they were shown one week apart at the same time of day (fig 1\u21d3). Participants were seated in comfortable chairs and were not aware in advance of either the movie genre or the study hypothesis; we provided them with a leaflet explaining that the study aimed to determine the effects on coagulation of sitting still and watching movies. Fig 1 Flow of participants through study The movies were shown at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology\u2019s main meeting room, which for the purposes of this study was transformed into a home-style cinema. The room has a non-threatening, welcoming atmosphere. Participants were asked to avoid alcohol and tobacco on movie days. To reduce the risk of confounding by superstition, no movies were shown during a full moon or on Friday the 13th. The participants provided written informed consent. Laboratory measurements Within 15 minutes before each movie, we took blood samples from each participant\u2019s antecubital vein and used the contralateral arm for the second blood sample taken within 15 minutes after each movie. Markers of coagulation activity (or potential \u201cfear factors\u201d) were blood coagulant factor VIII (IU/dL), D-dimer (ng/mL), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (\u03bcg/L), and prothrombin fragments 1+2 (pmol/L). Blood samples were drawn in vacuum tubes containing 0.105M sodium citrate and centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 minutes at 18\u00b0C within one hour of venepuncture. After aliquoting, the samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All markers were determined within one batch. We measured prothrombin fragments 1+2 and thrombin-antithrombin complexes in duplicate and the samples were measured using a sandwich-type enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Siemens, Marburg, Germany). Coagulant factor VIII and D-dimer levels were measured using the TOP analyser (Werfen Instrumentation Laboratory, Barcelona, Spain). The laboratory technicians were not aware of which movie corresponded to which blood sample. Fear scale and questionnaire After each movie the participants completed a visual analogue fear scale, designed specifically for this study. This scale estimates the degree of fear experienced while watching a movie, ranging from 0 (no fear at all) to 10 (worst fear imaginable). Additionally, participants reported whether they had already seen the movie and rated it on a scale from 0 (worst ever) to 10 (best ever). Finally, the participants completed a general questionnaire on lifestyle and favourite movie genre. Sample size calculation We calculated the sample size required for evaluation of coagulant factor VIII activity (two sided test, \u03b1=0.05, \u03b2=0.90) and determined that 23 participants would be required to observe an increase of 15 IU/dL (150 IU/L) or more (assuming a correlation between the difference in measurements at the two time points of 0.7). Taking into account possible dropouts, we determined that overall 24 participants would be required. Statistical analyses We summarised personal and baseline data as means with standard deviations, or proportions. Using a paired t test we compared the difference between the mean change in levels of coagulation markers (before and after watching the horror movie compared with before and after watching the educational movie). For the visual analogue fear scale we reported the mean change and 95% confidence intervals. At baseline (before both movies) the groups had similar levels of coagulation factors. Therefore we considered a carry-over effect to be absent and pooled the results of both groups by movie genre. \n \n Results Participants and recruitment The table shows the baseline characteristics of the study sample. Participants watched the movies, which started around 7 pm (15 minutes either way) and ended at around 8.30 pm (15 minutes either way) on 29 July and 4, 5, and 11 August. According to the availability of participants, 14 were assigned to the watch the horror movie first and 10 to watch the educational movie first. Baseline characteristics of study sample. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise View this table: Participants perceived the horror movie as being frightening, with a mean score on the visual analogue fear scale of 5.4 (SD 1.7). The corresponding values for the educational movie were 0.0 (SD 0.2): the mean difference between scores was 5.4 (95% confidence interval 4.7 to 6.1). Fear factor analyses Three participants were excluded from the primary analyses. In two, a sample was visibly haemolytic. Therefore these results were considered unreliable because in the case of haemolysis, various measurements (coagulation factors among them) are known to be inaccurate owing to degradation of red blood cells. The third participant was tense before the first blood sample was taken (before watching the educational movie); in an attempt to relax before the second blood sample was taken he ingested a family pack of chocolates. He subsequently fainted while blood was being taken after the educational movie. Fainting was not observed in association with the second, horror, movie. Since the assumption for a crossover trial (that is, similar circumstances except for the intervention) was clearly not met, we regarded the results as unusable (coagulant factor VIII levels before and after the educational movie were 132 IU/dL and 346 IU/dL, respectively, and before and after the horror movie were 109 IU/dL and 123 IU/dL, respectively). The mean baseline levels of coagulant factor VIII of the remaining 21 participants were similar before both the horror movie and the educational movie (mean difference \u22122.9 IU/dL, 95% confidence interval \u221210.1 to 4.2). However, the mean change in levels (difference between levels before and after the movie) was higher after the horror movie than after the educational movie (mean difference 11.1 IU/dL, 1.2 to 21.0, fig 2\u21d3). Coagulant factor VIII levels increased in 12 (57%) participants during the horror movie, but only in 3 (14%) during the educational movie. Levels decreased in 18 (86%) participants during the educational movie, but only in 9 (43%) during the horror movie. Fig 2 Absolute mean change in levels of coagulation factor VIII, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and prothrombin fragments 1+2 after exposure to a horror and educational movie (ordered by change in levels during watching a horror movie). Vertical bars represent individual participants, with order of participants identical in all graphs. *Difference -96 IU/dL, \u2020difference \u221227 IU/dL The mean D-dimer levels of participants were similar before watching the horror and educational movie. The mean change in levels before and after the educational movie was \u221235.1 ng/mL (SD 63.0) and before and after the horror movie was \u221231.8 (SD 109.3). Therefore no effect of acute fear on D-Dimer levels was observed (fig 2\u21d1): the mean difference was 3.33 ng/mL (95% confidence interval \u221237.1 to 43.8). There was also no effect on levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes: mean difference of differences \u22120.54 \u00b5g/L (95% confidence interval \u22122.5 to 1.4, fig 2\u21d1). All but two of the measurements for prothrombin fragments 1+2 levels before and after both movies were less than 200 pmol/L. The mean change in levels (fig 2\u21d1) before and after the educational movie was \u221210.2 (median \u22121.0) pmol/L and before and after the horror movie was \u221223.7 (median \u221221) pmol/L. \n \n Discussion In this crossover study we found that watching horror, or \u201cbloodcurdling,\u201d movies was associated with an increase in blood coagulant factor VIII. The mean increase in factor VIII levels of 11.1 IU/dL associated with acute fear could be clinically relevant, as every 10 IU/dL increase in coagulant factor VIII levels is associated with a 17% (95% confidence interval 7% to 28%) increase in the risk of venous thrombosis.11 Levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and prothrombin factors 1+2 did not prove to be fear factors. This indicates that although the coagulation cascade was influenced by acute fear, this did not lead to the formation of thrombin (thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin factors 1+2) and subsequent fibrin formation (D-dimer). Limitations of this study A limitation of the study could be the magnitude of fear induced by the movie genre. Although some participants scored 7 or 8 on the visual analogue fear scale, there is definite room for the enhancement of fear. However, such designs might elicit ethical controversy and would likely be confounded by physical exertion. Secondly, we did not completely reach the intended sample size. Nevertheless, we still found a clear 11.1 IU/dL (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 21.0) increase in coagulant factor VIII levels after exposure to the horror movie. Thirdly, participants were not randomised by the order in which the movies were watched. Finally, the visual analogue fear scale was not validated. Implications of this study The underlying biological mechanism of acute fear associated with an increase in coagulation activity is still to be unravelled. However, the results of this study might be explained by an adrenergic response, as epinephrine increases the concentrations of coagulant factor VIII.12 Also, desmopressin, a vasopressin analogue, has been used to increase coagulation activity in a wide range of bleeding diathesis.13 Desmopressin stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor, resulting in increased coagulant factor VIII levels.14 Although it is not immediately obvious by which means our results could confer clinical benefits, a broader implication of these study results is that after centuries the term \u201cbloodcurdling\u201d in literature is justified. Conclusion In young and healthy adults, watching bloodcurdling movies is associated with an increase in blood coagulant factor VIII without actual thrombin formation. What is already known on this topic As early as medieval times it was thought that fear induced curdling (congealing) of the blood \n \n Several studies have reported an increase in coagulation profiles in times of physical or psychological stress \n \n The effect of acute fear on the coagulation system is, however, still to be unravelled What this study adds Exposure of young and healthy adults to horror movies was associated with an increase in coagulant factor VIII levels \n \n No effect was observed on levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, or prothrombin fragment 1+2, suggesting that watching frightening movies is associated with an acute effect on coagulation without actual thrombin formation \n \n A truly relaxing and merry Christmas, without exposure to frightening situations, seems to be advisable to prevent venous thrombosis \n \n Footnotes Contributors: According to good epidemiological practice, the decision of who would be first and who would be second author was made by randomisation.

Dutch researchers found that a frightening situation\u2014in this case, watching a horror movie\u2014can increase levels of Factor VIII, a blood-clotting agent. \"We hypothesized that acute fear activates the coagulation system and that this poses an important evolutionary benefit, by preparing the body for blood loss during life-threatening situations,\" write the Leiden University Medical Center researchers in the study, which was published in the December issue of the British Medical Journal. The study used 24 healthy volunteers ages 30 and under. UPI reports 14 of the subjects watched the horror movie Insidious and then, a week later, watched the documentary A Year in Champagne at the same time of day. The order of the movies was reversed for the other volunteers. Blood samples were taken before and after participants viewed the movies. Levels of Factor VIII increased in 57% of subjects during the horror movie, while they decreased in 86% of participants during the documentary. No one in the study suffered a blood clot, NBC notes. While the researchers outline some study limitations (sample size, \"the magnitude of fear induced by the movie genre\"), they conclude that \"after centuries the term 'bloodcurdling' in literature is justified.\" (Speaking of fear, here's how to cure a spider phobia in 2 minutes.)",

Cook, who pointed out red flags a year ago, feels vindicated. Finally, stock prices confirmed what he saw in 2014: We\u2019re in a bear market and about to go over the cliff, he says. Here is a chat I had with Cook over the weekend. \n \n Why do you still believe we\u2019re in a bear market? \n \n First, the oil and gas situation is a huge problem, and it will continue. We\u2019re not getting bounces. Instead, oil investors just want to sell. The second problem, and it\u2019s just getting started, is China. China is like an athlete that twisted his ankle and needs time to heal. If the ankle doesn\u2019t heal, it will get worse, and that\u2019s what is happening right now. \n \n Is there anything technical that you are looking at? \n \n Yes. First, every rally in a bear market has no traction. In a bull market, rallies will hold for days or weeks. Now we\u2019re getting sharp \u201cone-day wonders\u201d that fail. Every hope is dashed. That is a strong characteristic of a bear market. Second, the NYSE Tick is registering no institutional activity on the buy side. Every rally is a chance for mutual funds to lighten positions. And this is only January. Wait until people look at their January statements. Many will be shocked. \n \n If this is a bear market, how will investors react in the months ahead? \n \n There are four psychological stages that people go through during a bear market. Right now, investors know the market is struggling but most believe it will come back. In fact, many see this as a buying opportunity. Here are the four stages: \n \n Stage 1: Denial \n \n Right now, we\u2019re in the denial stage. Anyone who is bullish is too stubborn to change his or her view. Many people have their head in the sand, and some may not even look at their January statements. Many believe the market will come back. Right now, many are still buying the dips, which does not work in a bear market. This is similar to what has happened to oil. \n \n Stage 2: High Anxiety \n \n In this stage, many investors are like a deer in the headlights. They are frozen and nervous but don\u2019t do anything. They are told by brokers and financial experts to stay calm and don\u2019t panic. We haven\u2019t reached this stage yet. \n \n Stage 3: Fear \n \n In this stage, the rampant bulls finally realize they are in trouble. If they have bought stocks on margin, they might be getting calls from their broker to add money to losing positions. In this stage, they are watching in fear as their portfolio burns. They reluctantly start to take action as fear increases. Often they say to themselves, \u201cWhen my stock gets back to even, I will sell.\u201d \n \n Stage 4: Panic \n \n This is what I call the \u201cuncle\u201d stage. This is when panicked investors throw in the towel and take action. They want to get out of the market while they still have something left. At this stage, there is huge downside volume and double-digit declines on the indexes. At the end of Stage 4, many people vow to never buy stocks again. We are not even close to this stage yet.

    "document": "LONDON Genes that increase the risk of a person developing schizophrenia may also increase the chance they will use cannabis, researchers said on Tuesday after studying more than 1,000 users of the drug. \n \n The results chime with previous studies linking schizophrenia and cannabis, but suggest the association may be due to common genes and might not be a causal relationship where cannabis use leads to increased schizophrenia risk. \n \n Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, and its use is higher among people with schizophrenia than in the general population. \n \n \"We know that cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia. Our study certainly does not rule this out, but it suggests that there is likely to be an association in the other direction as well \u2013 that a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use,\" said Robert Power, who led the study at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London. \n \n Schizophrenia is a common and severe psychiatric disorder that affects around one in 100 people. People who use cannabis are about twice as likely as those who do not to develop it. \n \n The disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and its most common symptoms are disruptions in thinking, language and perception. It often includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. \n \n While the exact cause is unknown, research to date suggests a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop it. \n \n Previous studies have found a number of genetic risk variants associated with schizophrenia, each of which slightly increases a person's risk of developing the condition. \n \n Cannabis use has frequently been associated with it, but there is much debate about whether this is because of a direct cause, or whether there may be shared genes which predispose people to both cannabis use and schizophrenia. \n \n A study published in March 2011 found that people who use cannabis in their youth dramatically increase their risk of psychotic symptoms, and that continued use of the drug can raise the risk of developing a psychotic disorder in later life. \n \n And earlier research found that young people who smoke cannabis for six years or more are twice as likely to have psychotic episodes, hallucinations or delusions. \n \n This latest study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry on Tuesday, included 2,082 healthy people of whom 1,011 had used cannabis. Each participant's genetic risk profile - the number of genes related to schizophrenia each of them carried - was measured. \n \n The researchers found that people genetically predisposed to schizophrenia were more likely to use cannabis, and to use it in greater amounts than those who had no schizophrenia risk genes. \n \n Power said the result \"highlights the complex interactions between genes and environments\" when it comes to cannabis as a risk factor for schizophrenia. \n \n \"Certain environmental risks, such as cannabis use, may be more likely given an individual's innate behavior and personality, itself influenced by their genetic make-up,\" he said, adding that this finding was important to consider when calculating the economic and health impact of cannabis. \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams) ||||| The association between marijuana and schizophrenia is historically fraught. In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists thought that smoking weed could trigger psychosis in just about anyone. Today, these findings are more nuanced, but researchers still think that cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in people who are predisposed to the disease \u2014 meaning those with family histories of the disorder. Yet, in the last decade, some scientists have actually started to look at the effect in reverse. The resulting studies suggest that the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia might also put people affected by the disorder at increased risk for smoking pot. But these results haven't garnered nearly as much attention as studies suggesting the opposite. \n \n part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap \n \n Now, a new study, published today in Molecular Psychiatry, lends further support to the idea that schizophrenia plays a role in an individual's likelihood of smoking weed, by showing that the genetic variants predicting schizophrenia can also be used to predict a person's tendency to smoke pot, regardless of their mental health history. This, researchers say, demonstrates that the causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia might not be clear-cut, and that at least a small part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap, where the same genes that predispose certain people to enjoying weed might also predispose others to developing schizophrenia \u2014 or both. \n \n To tease apart this relationship, researchers took genetic data from recently published studies of schizophrenia, and identified genetic variants associated with the disease. Then, they applied that information to a random sample of about 2,000 healthy Australians to see if those variants could also predict cannabis use. \n \n \"more likely to use cannabis, and in greater quantities.\" \n \n \"There is a well-established link between people who use cannabis and schizophrenia,\" says Robert Power, lead author of the study and a genetic psychiatrist at King's College London. But this study indicates \"that people who are at risk for schizophrenia are more likely to use cannabis, and in greater quantities,\" he says \u2014 which means the causal relationship might actually go both ways. Moreover, the genetic variants associated with schizophrenia were predictive for cannabis use in healthy individuals, so there appears to be some genetic overlap between the two. \n \n \"These findings are very valuable,\" says Eden Evins, a psychiatry professor at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, \"and suggest that increased genetic risk for schizophrenia increases the chance that someone will use cannabis, and use it heavily.\" But Evins doesn't think these results rule out previous findings that cannabis use increases a person's risk for developing schizophrenia. \"Both may be true,\" she says. This sentiment was echoed by Wolfram Kawohl, a psychiatrist at the University of Zurich, who said the results show that \"the connection is more complicated than some people may have thought,\" and that \"both connections may exist parallel along with possible others.\" \n \n \"I am suspect that this finding will hold out with the test of time.\" \n \n But Lynn DeLisi, another Harvard University psychiatry professor, isn't convinced. \"I am suspect that this finding will hold out with the test of time,\" she told The Verge in an email. DeLisi points to her own work, which showed there was no difference in family history of schizophrenia between people who smoke weed and people who don't. So, although there might be an interaction between smoking weed and schizophrenia, DeLisi said, it would be need to be shown in \"studies of people using cannabis compared with those who don't, both having a family history of schizophrenia.\" \n \n Furthermore, DeLisi thinks that today's high rates of cannabis use among teenagers and adults make it hard to link drug use to mental health issues or their genetic predispositions. \"Everyone uses cannabis these days, and I don't think they necessarily have genetic predispositions to do so.\" \n \n An ongoing debate \n \n \"The relationship is an ongoing debate in the scientific world \u2014 at least what the nature of the association is,\" said Matthew Hill, a cell biologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, who recently published an article dissecting this very relationship, in an email to The Verge. In the article, Hill argued that \"there is little evidence that, at a population level, cannabis use during adolescence is a primary contributing factor in the development of psychiatric illness.\" But he also noted that \"there is evidence that in high-risk populations, cannabis can be highly adverse, so arguments claiming that cannabis is innocuous are equally flawed.\" \n \n Weed affects people with schizophrenia differently \n \n When The Verge asked about the risks associated with cannabis use, Hill said that \"there are detailed studies which have demonstrated that cannabis can have very different effects on the brain of someone who is at risk for schizophrenia than someone who isn't.\" One 2013 study, for instance, demonstrated that the increased release of dopamine from smoking marijuana is amplified in the brains of people with schizophrenia, as well as in their close relatives. The results of this amplification are poorly understood, but some scientists think that a chronic elevation of dopamine can increase one's likelihood of experiencing psychotic episodes, and make the disorder harder to treat. Moreover, some studies indicate that people who find themselves in the early stages of schizophrenia and who also smoke weed experience larger brain modifications \u2014 such as changes in their white matter \u2014 compared to those who don't. \n \n \"cannabis use worsens the course of schizophrenia.\" \n \n \"There is definitely some kind of genetic basis to increased vulnerability to these adverse effects [in people with schizophrenia] that go beyond the correlational association discussed in this paper,\" Hill says. Evins agreed. \"It's well known that cannabis use worsens the course of schizophrenia,\" she said, \"so people with schizophrenia should be discouraged from using it.\" \n \n Furthermore, some studies have found that smoking pot accelerates the development of schizophrenia in those who are genetically predisposed, but that association took a hit in 2010, when researchers found that accounting for things like gender, lifetime mental health history, and socioeconomic status erased the effect. Still, some studies continue to point to this risk. \n \n Perhaps the reasons for these contradictory findings is that some individuals with schizophrenia react more strongly to marijuana than others with the same disorder. This was the finding of one 2010 study that demonstrated that 44 out of 121 schizophrenic participants either developed schizophrenia within a month of beginning to smoke marijuana, or saw their psychosis amplified by drug use. \n \n A complicated relationship \n \n Given all of this conflicting evidence, it seems likely that the relationship between marijuana and schizophrenia is even more complex than we once thought. No single gene has been associated with either drug addiction or schizophrenia, so these illnesses are the result of many genes working in combination, Evins said, \"each with a small contribution to the overall risk of developing the disorders.\" There's also a plethora of environmental factors that need to be taken into account \u2014 most of which we barely understand. \n \n This \"doesn't get a lot of attention.\" \n \n Still, Hill said, the idea that cannabis use and schizophrenia share common genes \"is interesting,\" partly because it highlights a dimension of this relationship that doesn't get a lot of attention. But causality is never easy to confirm, so this study will need to be replicated multiple times. And even then, Kawohl said, researchers probably won't be able to say that \"cannabis use has no consequences for the risk to develop schizophrenia.\" \n \n Regardless, it's important to remember that schizophrenia only affects a small number of people \u2014 about 1 percent of the US adult population \u2014 so \"the vast majority of adolescents and young adults who use cannabis won't develop it,\" Evins said. And that's actually a crucial point, because despite all the studies that link schizophrenia and cannabis, few have been able to explain why schizophrenia rates have remained stable \u2014 and may actually be declining \u2014 in the face of pot's increasing popularity among teens. \n \n the economic benefit of limiting pot use is \"pretty small.\" \n \n \"There may still be a causal role between cannabis and schizophrenia, but our results suggest that this causal role may have been overestimated,\" Power says. This is important, he says, because some people have used cannabis' relationship with psychosis to argue against its legalization. \"Already the actual economic benefit of limiting cannabis use in terms of schizophrenia is pretty small,\" Power says, pointing to a study that found that policymakers would have to stop at least 3,000 adolescents from smoking weed to prevent one case of psychosis from emerging. \n \n Still, Power thinks people with a family history of schizophrenia should avoid weed. \"The clinical advice is to stay away from events that might have a potential to cause stress,\" he says, because genes and environment are interconnected. Thus, \"people who are at-risk should try to avoid things that might damage their mental well-being.\" These things, he says, include weed.",

Chan School of Public Health and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \n \n The study cannot say for certain that it was the chocolate that prevented atrial fibrillation, however. \n \n Mostofsky and colleagues write in the journal Heart that eating cocoa and cocoa-containing foods may help heart health because they have a high volume of flavanols, which are compounds that are believed to have anti-inflammatory, blood vessel-relaxing and anti-oxidant properties. \n \n Past studies have that found eating chocolate - especially dark chocolate, which has more flavanols - is tied to better measures of heart health and decreased risk for certain conditions like heart attacks and heart failure, they add. \n \n There isn\u2019t as much research on whether chocolate is also linked to a lower risk of atrial fibrillation, which occurs when the upper chamber of the heart beats irregularly. \n \n At least 2.7 million people in the U.S. have atrial fibrillation, which increases their risk for blood clots and resulting strokes, heart failure and other complications, according to the American Heart Association. \n \n For the new analysis, the researchers used data collected for a long-term study of 55,502 people in Denmark. The men and women were between 50 and 64 years old when it began, and they provided information about their diets when they entered the study between 1993 and 1997. \n \n The researchers then linked that diet data to Denmark\u2019s national health registries to see who was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. \n \n Overall, about 3,346 cases of atrial fibrillation occurred over an average of 13.5 years. \n \n Based on their diets at the beginning of the study period, people who ate one serving, about 1 ounce (28.35 grams), of chocolate per week were 17 percent less likely to be diagnosed with atrial fibrillation by the end of the study than people who reported eating chocolate less than once a month. \n \n Similarly, those who ate 2 to 6 ounces per week were 20 percent less likely to be diagnosed with atrial fibrillation while those who ate more than an ounce of chocolate a day were 16 percent less likely to have the condition. \n \n Among women, the biggest risk reduction was tied to eating one serving of chocolate per week. For men, the biggest reduction came with eating two to six servings per week. \n \n \u201cI think our message here is that moderate chocolate intake as part of a healthy diet is an option,\u201d Mostofsky told Reuters Health. \n \n The researchers caution that they can\u2019t account for unmeasured factors, such as kidney disease and sleep apnea, that may influence the risk of atrial fibrillation. They also didn\u2019t have data on the type of chocolate or the amount of flavanols participants ate. Their diets may have also changed over the nearly 14 years of data collection. \n \n The data also suggests the participants who ate the most chocolate consumed more calories but had a lower body mass index - a measure of weight in relation to height - than people who ate the least chocolate, noted Alice Lichtenstein, director and senior scientist at the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University in Boston. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s very likely - if I had to bet - that these people were more physically active,\u201d said Lichtenstein, who was not involved in the new study. \n \n She said people likely can\u2019t get around the fact that they need to have a healthy diet, be physically active and not smoke to optimize their health. \n \n \u201cThere is no quick fix,\u201d she told Reuters Health. \n \n Drs. Sean Pokorney and Jonathan Piccini write in an accompanying editorial that the study\u2019s findings are interesting and warrant further consideration despite their limitations. \n \n \u201cA double-blind randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate the true efficacy of chocolate for the prevention of (atrial fibrillation) and such a trial would need to incorporate quantified doses of cocoa,\u201d write Pokorney and Piccini, of Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/2q8M5xs Heart, online Mary 23, 2017. ||||| Eating chocolate has been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke, and now a new study from Denmark suggests that regular consumption of the treat may help to prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat. \n \n Researchers found that adults in the study who ate chocolate at least once a month \u2014 or more frequently than that \u2014 had rates of atrial fibrillation that were 10 to 20 percent lower than those who ate chocolate less than once a month, according to the findings published today (May 23) in the journal Heart. \n \n Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the heart's two upper chambers, known as the atria, do not beat at the same pace as the heart's two lower chambers, resulting in an irregular heartbeat. The condition increases a person's risk of strokes, heart failure and cognitive impairment. \n \n The study found that the strongest overall effects were seen in men and women who ate 1 ounce of chocolate, two to six times per week, said the lead author of the study, Elizabeth Mostofsky, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centerin Boston. [5 Surprising Ways to Be Heart Healthy] \n \n One ounce of chocolate is equal to about three or four small, individual Dove Bar squares, for example, Mostofsky said. \n \n Between 2.7 million and 6.1 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, so it's important to identify effective ways to help prevent the condition from developing, the researchers wrote in their study. \n \n Two previous studies have looked at the connection between chocolate consumption and the risk of developing atrial fibrillation, but the results from both of those studies suggested that any association found may be due to chance. \n \n Unlike those two earlier studies, whose participants were only men or only women, the new study included both men and women. And the new study also included adults who had been clinically diagnosed with atrial fibrillation rather than people who had self-reported the condition, as was the case with the previous studies. \n \n In the new study, the researchers analyzed data collected from more than 55,000 adults between ages 50 and 64 in Denmark. All of them were participants in an ongoing study called the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study. [5 Wacky Things That Are Good for Your Health] \n \n When the participants were first recruited for the study between 1993 and 1997, they completed a detailed food-frequency questionnaire. One of those questions asked how frequently the participant ate chocolate during the past year. \n \n The researchers found that more than 3,300 adults were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (a condition in which the heart beats faster than usual, but is not irregular) over the follow-up period of 13.5 years, on average. \n \n When researchers took into consideration other factors that could influence people's development of atrial fibrillation, such as alcohol intake, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, the study showed an association between people with a moderate intake of chocolate and a lower risk of developing atrial fibrillation. \n \n The study does not prove there is a cause-and-effect relationship between eating chocolate and a lowered risk of atrial fibrillation. And although the exact mechanism of how chocolate may prevent atrial fibrillation is not known, it's possible that compounds in chocolate called flavonoids may play a role, the researchers said. \n \n Flavonoids have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, Mostofsky said. They may limit the inflammatory process in the body, reducing the stickiness of the blood and leading to less scarring of connective tissue. All of these factors may help prevent the electrical remodeling of the heart that leads to atrial fibrillation, she explained. \n \n The findings showed that for women, the strongest association was seen in those who ate a 1-ounce serving of chocolate, once a week \u2013 this level of consumption was linked to a 21 percent lower risk of atrial fibrillation. For men, the strongest association was seen in those who ate two to six 1-ounce servings of chocolate weekly. These men had a 23 percent lower risk of atrial fibrillation. \n \n But Mostofsky cautioned that chocolate sold in Europe generally has a higher cocoa content than chocolate available in the United States. [6 Distinctive Food Guides from Around the World] \n \n All in all, the findings suggest that compared with some other snack choices, a moderate intake of chocolate may be a heart-healthy snack, Mostofsky told Live Science. But people should choose chocolate with a higher cocoa content, which has more health benefits and protective compounds, she said. \n \n One of the limitations of the study is that people in Denmark are more similar to each other in race and ethnicity than people in other countries, so the findings may not be generalizable to other populations, other researchers wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. \n \n The chocolate consumers in the study were also generally healthier, better educated and had lower rates of high blood pressure and diabetes than the people who didn't eat chocolate, and all of these factors could lessen their odds for atrial fibrillation, wrote the editorial authors Dr. Jonathan Piccini and Dr. Sean Pokorney. Both doctors are cardiologists at the Duke Center for Atrial Fibrillation at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. \n \n Even so, Piccini and Pokorney said \"the findings are interesting and warrant further consideration, given the importance of identifying effective prevention strategies for atrial fibrillation.\" \n \n Since 25 percent of adults will develop atrial fibrillation over the course of their lifetime, there is a need to identify additional prevention targets, including lifestyle factors, to lower the risk, according to the editorial. \n \n Originally published on Live Science. ||||| If you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center\u2019s RightsLink service.

Regularly eating chocolate could possibly help prevent a type of irregular heartbeat that can increase the risk of heart failure, strokes, and cognitive impairment, according to a study published Tuesday in Heart. Live Science reports between 2.7 million and 6.1 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, in which the upper chambers of the heart beat at a different pace than the lower chambers. But a study of 55,000 adults in Denmark found that those who ate chocolate at least once a month had rates of atrial fibrillation 10% to 20% lower than those who ate it less than once a month. The best results came from eating an ounce of chocolate two to six times per week. It's impossible to say based on the study whether chocolate consumption was directly responsible for lower rates of atrial fibrillation. Researchers also aren't clear how chocolate could even affect the development of the condition, but it may have something to do with things called flavanols, the Los Angeles Times reports. Atrial fibrillation is thought to be caused by molecules damaging heart tissue. The flavanols in chocolate can stop inflammation that leads to tissue damage. \"As part of a healthy diet, moderate intake of chocolate is a healthy snack choice,\" Reuters quotes the study's lead author as saying. Though it's important to choose chocolate with a higher cocoa content. (And you should probably also take it easy on the ibuprofen.)",

Atrial fibrillation occurs when the two upper chambers of the heart\u2014the atria\u2014do not beat at the same pace as the two lower chambers, reports Medical News Today. The condition increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship, but researchers say their findings suggest that chocolate could help prevent atrial fibrillation in people who already have heart disease or high blood pressure. An editorial accompanying the study notes that the results are based on self-reported data, so it's important to conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled trial that incorporates chocolate doses. \u2013 People who eat chocolate regularly have a lower risk of an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, according to a new study. The Harvard and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center researchers found that people who ate a single ounce of chocolate once a week were 21% less likely to develop the condition, which increases the risk of strokes, heart failure, and cognitive impairment, LiveScience reports. For men, the risk was 23% lower. The study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, did not prove that chocolate causes atrial fibrillation or that chocolate is the culprit, but researchers suggest that chocolate has more cocoa content and that compounds in chocolate called flavonoids may help prevent the heart's electrical remodeling that leads to atrial fibrillation. \u2013 Atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, is the No. 1 cause of stroke and heart attack deaths in the US. But a new study finds that people who suffer from atrial fibrillation are more likely to die from a heart attack or stroke than from any other cause, reports the New York Times. Researchers followed more than 5,400 people with an average age of 73 and found that those who suffered an arrhythmia had a 26% higher risk of death from any cause than those who didn't.

The condition can lead to dizziness, chest pain, trouble breathing, and even death, according to Live Science. There is currently no treatment for atrial fibrillation, but researchers are trying to find ways to prevent it in the first place.

    "document": "In the late 20th and early 21st century, Brazil set policies that made it a world leader in reducing deforestation, helping safeguard the Amazon. \n \n However, the gains made over those years are now at risk due to the proposed environmental policies of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who analysts say is highly likely to become Brazil\u2019s president in a runoff election on 28 October. \n \n Bolsonaro has pledged to shut down Brazil\u2019s environmental ministry, relax environmental law enforcement and licensing, open indigenous reserves to mining, ban international environmental NGOs such as Greenpeace and WWF from the country, and back out of the Paris climate accord. \n \n A study by this commentary\u2019s authors estimates that Brazilian deforestation and carbon emissions under Bolsonaro\u2019s policies would cause unprecedented Amazon forest loss, and contribute to destabilizing the global climate. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the authors, not necessarily Mongabay. \n \n It was almost too good to be true. In the late 20th and early 21st century, Brazil\u2019s Amazon forest was disappearing at a rapid rate (27,772 square kilometers or 10,723 square miles per year in 2004), making the country the worldwide leader in deforestation and a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). Then, starting in 2005, annual deforestation rates began to decrease at a breathtaking speed, dropping to 4,575 square kilometers (1,766 square miles) in 2012, a historical low, and a fall of more than 83 percent in just eight years. \n \n This caused the country\u2019s carbon emissions due to land use change to fall sharply, by 63 percent from 2005 to 2012. Building on these successes, the Brazilian government pledged an ambitious reduction of its GHG emissions \u2013 37 percent by 2025, and 43 percent by 2030, below 2005 levels \u2013 a promise made at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December, 2015. \n \n There are several plausible causes behind the sudden decrease in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, including the expansion of protected areas and indigenous lands, better enforcement of existing environmental legislation, interventions in supply chains and credit restrictions, and fines and embargoes of illegal deforesters. \n \n While praised by many inside and outside the government, the durability of this achievement is uncertain, given increasing demand for Brazil\u2019s agricultural commodities worldwide, large-scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects (including Amazon dams, roads and railways), and political upheaval. \n \n Today, in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis and political unrest, environmental protections are in danger of being rolled back. The annual deforestation rate in the world\u2019s largest rainforest has been steadily growing since 2012. \n \n But the worst is likely yet to come. Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate who is poised to become Brazil\u2019s next president after taking a near-majority in a first round vote, has promised that, if elected, he would shut down Brazil\u2019s environmental ministry, relax environmental law enforcement and licensing, open indigenous reserves to mining, and back out of the Paris climate accord. Moreover, international NGOs, such as Greenpeace and WWF, would be banned from the country. \n \n The damage these policies could do is extreme. Based on an economic modeling approach that simulates the competition for land in order to meet a growing global demand for major commodities such as beef and soybeans, we estimate that, if environmental protections are removed by Brazil\u2019s next president, the average annual loss of primary forest in the Amazon will quickly rise to 25,600 square kilometers (9,884 square miles) per year, a figure similar to the deforestation rates measured at the beginning of the 2000s and an increase of 268 percent from 2017. \n \n Within a decade, the scale of deforestation would be equivalent to the area of the UK or the US state of Oregon. Moreover, 18 percent of this deforestation (46,300 square kilometers or 17,877 square miles) would occur inside protected areas, including national parks and indigenous reserves. \n \n Carbon emissions would rise as deforestation increases. Under Bolsonaro\u2019s proposed policies, from 2021 to 2030, accumulated emissions from clear cutting Amazon forest would attain 13.12 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e), or an average of 1.31 GtCO2e per year, making it all but impossible for Brazil to fulfill its international commitments made in Paris. This annual carbon release corresponds to 3 percent of the current global emissions. Moreover, according to the latest literature 13.12 GtCO2e could represent up to 20 percent of the \u201cfree\u201d carbon budget remaining to achieve the 1.5 Celsius IPCC goal. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. \n \n In this election, and in the coming years, political will is needed to ensure that the Amazon forest and the ecosystem services it provides are conserved. The loss of biodiversity and climate regulation that could result from a dramatic change in policies would be a tipping point for both biodiversity and climate change, with global consequences. \n \n Authors: Aline C.

The area is equivalent to 987,000 football pitches. \n \n The Guardian view on Brazil\u2019s new president: a global danger | Editorial Read more \n \n The news was met by dismay from environmentalists who warned deforestation was likely to become more acute when Bolsonaro becomes president on 1 January. \n \n \u201cIt is a lot of destroyed forest,\u201d said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brasil\u2019s public policy coordinator. \u201cThe situation is very worrying\u2026 what is bad will get worse.\u201d \n \n The environment ministry said the increase came despite an increase in its budget and in operations carried out by its environment agency Ibama. \n \n \u201cWe need to increase the mobilisation at all levels of government, of society, and of the productive sector to combat illicit environmental activities,\u201d environment minister Edson Duarte said in a statement. \n \n But the government appears to be heading in the other direction. \n \n After falling for several years, deforestation began rising again in 2013, the year after leftist president Dilma Rousseff approved a new forest code which gave an amnesty to those deforesting on small properties. Deforestation has risen in four of the six years since then, including in 2016, the year Rousseff was impeached and replaced by her former vice-president Michel Temer. \n \n Warming oceans are changing the world's rainfall | John Abraham Read more \n \n Temer has made further concessions to powerful agribusiness interests in return for support from its congressional representatives \u2013 including approving a measure that legalised land that had been squatted in the Amazon, a common deforestation driver. Last year Temer backed down on measures to reduce protection to a national forest called Jamanxim and a protected area called Renca after protests from environmentalists, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen and even singer Alicia Keys at the Rock in Rio music festival. \n \n Moves like these signalled the Brazilian congress was no longer concerned about deforestation, said Astrini, encouraging deforestation. \n \n \u201cWe feel in our field work that these deforestation gangs are very confident they will get amnesty or that they are covered,\u201d he said. \n \n As more and more of the Amazon is cut down, the world\u2019s greatest forest is now getting close to the \u201ctipping point\u201d \u2013 after which experts fear it could disappear. \n \n \u201cA moment will arrive in which the accumulation of this deforestation will cause an effect in which the forest will stop being a forest,\u201d Astrini said. \u201cThe scientists calculate this is between 20-30%. We are very close to the 20%.\u201d \n \n The Climate Observatory (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima) \u2013 a non-profit, climate change network \u2013 calculated that in 2017, 46% of Brazil\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions were due to deforestation. \n \n It also expects deforestation to worsen once Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s new government begins. He has frequently attacked what he calls the \u201cfines industry\u201d of agencies such as Ibama, and wants to allow mining in protected indigenous reserves \u2013 some of the Amazon\u2019s least-destroyed forests \u2013 and even considered making the environment ministry part of the agriculture ministry. \n \n Bolsonaro has enjoyed support from agribusiness and his minister of agriculture will be headed up by Tereza Cristina, head of its Congress lobby. \n \n His foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, has argued that global warming is a Marxist plot. On Friday, his vice-president elect, General Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, while admitting global warming did exist, told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper: \u201cEnvironmentalism is used as an instrument of domination by big economies.\u201d \n \n Bolsonaro only backed down on plans to withdraw Brazil from the Paris climate deal because agricultural producers argued the move risked boycotts from European consumers, local media reported. \n \n \u201cIf the problem is in politics and politicians and their power of decision, they need to be pressured,\u201d Astrini said. ||||| Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The government blamed illegal logging for the rise \n \n Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has hit its highest rate in a decade, according to official data. \n \n About 7,900 sq km (3,050 sq miles) of the world's largest rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018 - an area roughly five times the size of London. \n \n Environment Minister Edson Duarte said illegal logging was to blame. \n \n The figures come amid concerns about the policies of Brazil's newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro. \n \n During the 2018 election campaign, Mr Bolsonaro pledged to limit fines for damaging forestry and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. \n \n An aide for the president-elect has also announced the administration will merge the agriculture and environment ministries, which critics say could endanger the rainforest. \n \n The latest government data says most of the deforestation occurred in the states of Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1, and marked a 13.7% rise over last year's figures. \n \n Mato Grosso is the top producer of grains in Brazil, and critics say expanding agriculture is also encroaching on the rainforest. \n \n Mr Duarte blamed \"an upsurge in organised crime\" for the illegal deforestation, and said the country must broaden the fight against \"environmental violations and in defence of sustainable development of the biome\". \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Amazon is sometimes called the lungs of the planet \n \n Satellite data from the deforestation monitoring project known as Prodes informed the annual survey. \n \n While the rate does mark a significant rise from last year, when the rate of deforestation dropped 16% in a 12-month period, it still marks a 72% drop from 2004, when the Brazilian federal government launched measures to combat deforestation. \n \n In that year, an area the size of Haiti - more than 27,000 sq km - was cleared from the rainforest. \n \n The Amazon region holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world and is home to plant and animal species that are still being discovered by scientists. \n \n Most of its millions of square kilometres are inside Brazil, where under laws dating back to 1965, landowners must keep a percentage of their property forested. ||||| \n \n De acordo com o ministro do Meio Ambiente, Edson Duarte, \"o recrudescimento do crime organizado que atua no desmatamento ilegal da Amaz\u00f4nia, destruindo as riquezas naturais do pa\u00eds e causando danos para toda sociedade, est\u00e1 associado a outras pr\u00e1ticas criminosas, como tr\u00e1fico de armas e animais, trabalho escravo, evas\u00e3o de divisas e lavagem de dinheiro.

Entre agosto de 2017 e julho de 2018, o sistema registrou aumento de 13,7% no desmatamento do bioma. ||||| The president-elect of Brazil has big plans for the Amazon rainforest. \n \n He wants to carve more mines and pave new roads. He wants fewer penalties for cutting down trees, and he has promised to halt growth of a network of indigenous forest reserves. By merging the nation's agriculture and environment ministries, he hopes to make it easier for Brazil's powerful soy and cattle industries to transform more native jungle into pasture and farms. \n \n When Jair Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old retired Brazilian military officer, takes the helm in January of a country that manages 1.5 million square miles of the Amazon, the risks to wildlife and indigenous tribal communities will be clear. If Bolsonaro follows through on his campaign promises, deforestation rates in Brazil could almost immediately triple, according to an assessment by scientists. \n \n View Images Bolsonaro, leader of the right-wing Social Liberal Party, stands before the Brazilian flag on election day. Photograph by Mauro Pimentel, AFP/Getty Images \n \n But the consequences of Bolsonaro's policies also would be felt far beyond areas hit by chainsaws. Even modest increases in deforestation could affect water supplies in Brazilian cities and in neighboring countries while harming the very farms he is trying to expand. More massive deforestation might alter water supplies as far away as Africa or California. \n \n Most troubling of all: Some scientists suggest the Amazon may already be nearing a tipping point. The region has been so degraded that even a small uptick in deforestation could send the forest hurtling toward a transition to something resembling a woodland savanna, according to an analysis earlier this year by two top scientists. In addition to forever destroying huge sections of the world's largest rainforest, that shift would release tremendous quantities of planet-warming greenhouse gases, which could hasten the decline of whatever forest remained. \n \n \"We are already in a very critical situation in terms of climate change,\" says Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, a native Brazilian who studies tropical forests at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. She's the lead author on a study published this month showing that the mix of tree species across the forest is already shifting in response to rising temperatures. \n \n \"If we mess up with the Amazon, carbon dioxide emissions will increase so massively that everyone will suffer,\" she adds. \n \n By some accounts, it could happen quite fast. \n \n The rainforest creates rain \n \n Bolsonaro, a right-wing congressman from Rio de Janeiro, soundly defeated a former mayor of Sao Paulo in Brazil's presidential election late last month. The populist president-elect is so openly hostile to his country's established order that some call him \"Tropical Trump.\" \n \n His rise comes at a perilous moment for the Amazon. \n \n From poison dart frogs and giant anteaters to golden lion tamarins and stinging bullet ants, the South American rainforest is the most species-rich biome on Earth, with more diverse plant life in a single acre than may be found in many American states. It is home to 10 percent of the world's species, including 2.5 million species of insect. \n \n The forest also influences the water cycle on a regional and perhaps even global scale. As moisture comes off the Atlantic Ocean it falls on the forest as rain. This water gets sucked up by deep roots, then moves through plants and across the surface of leaves before returning to the atmosphere. Winds blowing over the uneven forest canopy create turbulence, which allows the atmosphere to absorb more moisture. \n \n All this water then moves like a giant flowing river in the sky, falling as rain and then evaporating again and again until it reaches the Andes. Ultimately, the forest produces at least half of its own rain. \n \n \"One water vapor molecule may be recycled five to seven times before it leaves the system, either through the atmosphere or the Amazon River,\" says Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of Sao Paulo's Institute for Advanced Studies. \n \n But experts increasingly fear this delicate exchange could collapse. The loss of just a fraction more of this moisture-creating forest could lead far more of it to dry out, which would reduce rainfall even more, in a self-reinforcing spiral. Already, climate change, decades of logging, and land-clearing by intentionally set wildfires have sparked record-setting droughts in 2005, 2010, and 2015-2016. \n \n \"That suggests the system is flickering,\" says Thomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University professor and senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation, who is widely considered the godfather of biodiversity studies. \n \n Lovejoy and Nobre recently tried to estimate how close to the edge the Amazon really is. Their projection, published earlier this year as an editorial in Science Advances, suggests that in the most susceptible parts of the rainforest\u2014the southern, eastern and central Amazon\u2014loss of as little as 20 to 25 percent of original forestland could tip the system into an unstoppable transition to a drier, savanna-like ecosystem. \n \n Already, by the Brazilian government's own estimates, 17 percent of the Amazon forest system has been lost\u2014not including the parts that are still largely intact, but degraded. \n \n How likely is the scenario Lovejoy describes? \n \n \"It's not something we know with any confidence, but it's a possibility\u2014and not just a crazy, harebrained possibility. It's a very real one,\" says Abigail L. S. Swann, a University of Washington eco-climatologist who is contributing to a chapter on abrupt landscape changes for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's next assessment. \n \n While no one knows precisely where the Amazon\u2019s tipping point may lie, \"it makes no sense at all to discover the tipping point by actually tipping over it,\" Lovejoy says. \n \n The forest is changing already \n \n Even as Bolsonaro prepares to take office, the Amazon is already changing. \n \n The dry season is lengthening and rainfall has dropped by a quarter in some regions. Meanwhile, precipitation, when it comes, sometimes arrives in more intense bursts, leading to massive floods in 2009, 2012, and 2014. The region's climate system is oscillating more wildly. \n \n In the study she led, published in the journal Global Change Biology with more than a hundred other scientists as co-authors, Esquivel-Muelbert found that during the past 30 years, more drought-tolerant plant species have appeared in the Amazon, while species that predominantly emerge in wet areas are declining. Fast-growing trees and taller trees that are better at accessing the sun are outcompeting shorter, damp-loving species. \n \n Another study shows the rate of tree deaths is increasing. \n \n It's not clear whether all this is the beginning of the shift Lovejoy and Nobre predicted\u2014or something else. \"But it's still important because the species are beginning to change, and that can change how the forest behaves,\" Esquivel-Muelbert says. \n \n How will that change the interactions among tens of thousands of species within the jungle? No one yet knows. \n \n \"It's sending ripples through the system, and we have no idea where they are going to lead,\" Lovejoy says. \"It could become a much simpler ecosystem, and what that means in terms of its overall stability is a real question.\" \n \n If Lovejoy is right, and heat and deforestation lead to less rain and a transition to a different type of landscape, consequences will be felt far and wide. \n \n Expanding ripples \n \n For starters, it's impossible to quantify the true value of lost diversity. In one recent review, a team found evidence that 381 new types of plants or animals had been discovered in the Amazon during a single two-year period from 2014 to 2015\u2014the equivalent of one new species every other day. \n \n \"It's kind of a clich\u00e9 that the cure for cancer might be in the Amazon, but it's also kind of true,\" Esquivel-Muelbert says. \n \n Moisture from the Amazon also nourishes the winter rains that supply Uruguay, northern Argentina and Paraguay with water. The recent drought that led to water shortages in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, were likely exacerbated by rainforest shifts. \n \n In some places, rainfall in the Amazon also helps supply water to the very soy farmers and beef ranchers who are clearing the forest. Brazilian agriculture, it seems, actually needs the Amazon. \n \n \"We need to have forest in order to have the rain necessary to plant crops,\" Esquivel-Muelbert says. \n \n Massive deforestation of the Amazon could change weather outside South America as well. Because water vapor heats the air as it condenses high in the sky to form liquid raindrops, a significant reduction in rain caused by deforestation would actually cool the atmosphere above the region. That cooling perturbation would leave the southern hemisphere in atmospheric waves\u2014generating untold ripple effects around the planet. \n \n According to one modeling study , for example, if the Amazon were ever completely deforested, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains\u2014a crucial water reservoir for California\u2014would be diminished by half. \n \n That\u2019s without even considering the effect on CO2 and climate. \n \n Burning time \n \n \"The Amazon stores a tremendous amount of carbon,\" Nobre says. \n \n Instead of sucking CO2 from the sky, a deforested Amazon could instead begin releasing stored greenhouse gases. If 60 percent of the forest were to degrade to a savanna, Nobre says, that could unleash the equivalent of five or six years\u2019 worth of global fossil-fuel emissions. \n \n Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, called it \"another aggravating climate feedback\" loop, where drying rainforest leads to less absorption of CO2, which in turn promotes more climate change, drying more forest. \n \n \"We depend quite a bit on the continued functioning of key carbon sinks,\" he says. \"That\u2019s just one of the many things that makes climate change a global problem.\" \n \n In fact, deforestation, fire, and climate change already work synergistically in the Amazon. In recent years, climate change has sparked droughts that let wildfires burn bigger and longer. Between 2003 and 2013, forest clearing dropped by 76 percent, but the increase in wildfire, especially during the drought of 2015, erased half the increased absorption of CO2. \n \n That's why Lovejoy and Nobre conclude that\u2014contrary to Bolsonaro's campaign promise\u2014what the Amazon needs is not deforestation, but a massive campaign of tree planting. \n \n \"It really makes sense to do some active reforestation to build that margin of safety,\" Lovejoy says. \"It doesn't have to be the forest primeval, but you need something with trees and relatively complex communities.\"",

    "document": "\u201c Be Free or Die makes you want to stand up and cheer. Cate Lineberry has done us all a great service by telling this incredibly moving, thrilling, and important story about an American hero who deserves to be remembered, and admired.\u201d \n \n \u2013 Candice Millard, New York Times bestselling author of Hero of the Empire ||||| View Images Harold Hayes, seen here on the left in 1945 and on the right in present day, was one of the first medics added to the 807th\u2019s roster. \n \n Photographs courtesy Miranda Harple/Cate Lineberry (right) and Harold Hayes Collection (left) \n \n Harold Hayes was only 21 years old in November 1943 when the transport plane he and 29 other Americans were traveling in crash-landed in Nazi-occupied Albania. \n \n During their months-long ordeal, the group of men and women traversed more than 600 miles of brutal terrain, dodged German troops, faced desperate hunger and debilitating illnesses, survived blizzards, and were caught in crossfire. When they finally made it across Allied lines, they were forbidden by the military from discussing the details of the events with anyone, even their family members. \n \n Now, almost 70 years later, Hayes, the only living member of the group, talks about his experiences with Cate Lineberry, author of the new book, The Secret Rescue: An Untold Story of American Nurses and Medics Behind Nazi Lines, published this month. \n \n What was your role in the Army Air Forces, and where were you serving in early November 1943? \n \n I was a medic and a member of the 807th Medical Air Evacuation Transport Squadron in Catania, Sicily. We flew from our headquarters in Sicily to southern Italy on transport planes carrying equipment and men toward the front lines, helped load sick and wounded patients onto empty planes, and escorted the patients back to Sicily or North Africa where they could receive better medical treatment. \n \n Who was traveling with you on the C-53D transport plane that November day? \n \n There were 30 people on the plane: a pilot, a co-pilot, a radio operator, and a crew chief, plus 13 nurses and 13 medics. Rain had prevented any of us from leaving Catania for the previous three days, so our commanding officer decided to send half of the medical personnel in our squadron to help evacuate the many patients who were waiting. Only one passenger, besides the flight crew, was not part of the 807th. He was a medic from the 802nd who was catching a ride with us to Bari [on the southeastern coast of Italy]. \n \n Why did the pilots crash-land the plane? \n \n There wasn't a cloud in the sky when we left the airfield, but the closer we got to Bari, the more clouds appeared. We were soon caught in a violent storm and lost all communication with the station at Bari. The pilots ascended above the clouds, but when the plane got up to about 8,000 feet, the wings started icing up, so we had to dive down through the clouds. We could see a coastline; the pilots thought we might have flown across Italy and were near Italy's western coast. They didn't realize we'd crossed the Adriatic. The pilots tried to land on what looked like an abandoned airfield, and that's when someone started shooting at us. The pilots immediately headed for the clouds. That was probably the scariest part\u2014flying through a valley where the tops of the mountains were higher than the clouds. When we emerged from the clouds, our plane was very close to a German fighter plane and then to another. The pilots continued trying to dodge the enemy planes and eventually found a place near a lake where we crash-landed. \n \n Who helped you after the crash? \n \n Our first helpers were Albanian partisans, members of a resistance group fighting the Germans, who led us through the mountains. We were also helped by many Albanian villagers who let us stay with them at night and shared what little food they had with us. If they'd been caught, the Germans would likely have killed them. I'm certain that without the help of the Albanian people, we wouldn't have survived that winter. The British working in the country as well as an American officer sent in to help us eventually got us out. \n \n What was your greatest concern while you were trapped behind enemy lines? \n \n One of our biggest concerns was that the American military, as well as our families, didn't know where we were. They didn't even know we were in Albania; they only knew we were missing. Our other major concern was that our shoes were wearing out quickly because of the terrain, particularly those of the nurses. We hoped to get to the coast, and the only way there was to walk. \n \n How did the group get along during those difficult months? \n \n For the most part, we got along pretty well, but there were a few people who rubbed each other the wrong way. When you're hungry, cold, and tired, you forget about almost everything else and are only thinking about surviving. Watson, one of the nurses, said, \"Anything a medic can do, I can do,\" and that's exactly what she did. That's how most of the nurses were. They didn't slow us down. \n \n Why were you forbidden from discussing your experiences in Albania, even after the war was over? \n \n When we returned to Allied lines, we were not allowed to tell anyone where we had been, who helped us, or how we escaped. The secrecy was to protect the people who had helped us and to protect the means of escape for future downed airmen. After the war, Enver Hoxha became the ruthless dictator of Albania, and we were concerned that if we named the Albanians who saved our lives, they would be killed. We later learned that one of the partisans who helped us was imprisoned shortly after the war and was eventually executed. ||||| \u201cFor many years, I didn\u2019t say anything about what happened in Albania,\u201d Mr. Hayes said in a 2015 telephone interview with The New York Times from his assisted-living home in Medford. \u201cAfter the war was over, Hoxha was ruthless. If he discovered the names of anyone who had helped us, he had them and their families executed.\u201d \n \n Mr. Hayes had no special role in the group\u2019s survival, but by outliving all his wartime comrades, he became a last conduit for their story, which was related in a 1999 memoir by one of the nurses, and more recently in several books, notably \u201cThe Secret Rescue\u201d (2013), by Cate Lineberry, whose account relied heavily on Mr. Hayes\u2019s recollections. \n \n The perilous adventure began two months after Italy surrendered and Allied forces invaded Italy to begin pushing the Germans back across Europe. On Nov. 8, 1943, the nurses, medics and fliers of the Army Air Force\u2019s 807th Medical Air Evacuation Transport Squadron took off from Catania, Sicily, bound for Bari, on Italy\u2019s east coast, where hundreds of wounded troops awaited air evacuation. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Their twin-engine cargo plane carried no weapons, but the pilot, First Lt. Charles Thrasher, 22, anticipated no fighting. With him were a co-pilot, radio operator and crew chief. The nurses, all second lieutenants, were 22 to 32 years old. The medics, including Mr. Hayes, 21, from Indianola, Iowa, were all equivalent to staff sergeants and ranged in age from 21 to 36. \n \n An hour into the flight, the plane became lost in a huge storm over the Adriatic Sea. Its compass and communications failed. Blown 100 miles off course, it crossed the coast of Albania and was intercepted by German fighters and attacked by antiaircraft guns. It plunged to a belly landing in a marsh 25 miles inland. Willis Shumway, 23, the crew chief, was the only casualty, with a knee injury that left him unable to walk. \n \n The disoriented Americans had no idea where they were. Fearing a fuel explosion, they scrambled out of the plane and encountered their first bit of luck. Striding out of a woods was a band of rugged-looking men with rifles and daggers. One spoke a little English. He was Hasan Gina, an anti-German partisan leader. He told the Americans they were in Albania. \n \n Later, they would learn that they were 150 miles east of Bari, on the wrong side of the Adriatic, surrounded by German forces that had occupied Albania for months, and were caught in a civil war between rival partisan groups. \n \n The Americans knew almost nothing of Albania, a small, mostly Muslim country that had changed little in centuries. The mountainous terrain was dotted with impoverished villages. There were no railroads and few roads. Mules and horses were the main transportation. There was little running water or electricity. Winters were brutal, food was scarce, and blood feuds were common among the ferociously proud peoples. \n \n With only a general plan to reach the west coast and somehow cross the Adriatic to Italy, the Americans began walking in the wrong direction. Over the ensuing weeks, guided by the partisans, they trekked through mountains and valleys, sometimes cutting back or traveling in circles to avoid German patrols, living in the open or sheltering in villages and sharing cornbread with peasants. \n \n The Americans were soon listed as missing in action, and War Department telegrams, beginning \u201cregret to inform you,\u201d were sent to their families back home. \n \n The survivors, meantime, carried Sergeant Shumway on a stretcher made of seats from the plane; they later found pack animals for him. After five days, they rested at a partisan-controlled town called Berat, where they were cheered, mistaken for the vanguard of an Allied invasion to liberate Albania. They also met other partisan leaders, and learned of a British agent who had recently parachuted into the country. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Their respite lasted only a few days. Then, they awoke to gunfire and the explosion of artillery shells as German forces entered the town. In the ensuing confusion, German planes strafed a truck carrying some of the escaping Americans. Three nurses were separated from the main group and left behind in Berat; they took refuge in a farmhouse, and remained in hiding in the area for four months. \n \n The main group of Americans climbed on foot to a mountain village and were caught in a crossfire between partisan groups. \u201cIt was the first time the Americans had heard of the rival group, and they were beginning to realize they were in as much danger from the country\u2019s internal battle as they were from the Germans,\u201d Ms. Lineberry wrote in \u201cThe Secret Rescue.\u201d \n \n Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Facing starvation, they made tea by boiling straw and ate berries that worsened their diarrhea. Sharing with peasants was sometimes a culture shock. Mr. Hayes and another medic saw a sheep\u2019s head roasted over coals, then split in half with an ax. \n \n \u201cThe Americans watched wide-eyed as two women each took one-half of the head and ate everything, including the eyeballs,\u201d Ms. Lineberry wrote. \u201cNothing was wasted.\u201d \n \n As autumn waned, blizzards enveloped the Americans. Their clothing was too thin. Their shoes were worn out. \u201cThough all their feet soon felt like blocks of ice and their bodies shivered, they knew they had to keep going,\u201d Ms. Lineberry wrote. \u201cThe snow was coming down so fast they could barely see the person in front of them, but they had to stay together to avoid losing one another in the blinding white storm.\u201d \n \n On Nov. 27, British intelligence in Albania learned from partisans that the American plane had crashed and that the nurses, medics and crew were alive, trying to reach the coast. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander in Europe, as well as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the families of the missing were told. \n \n In December, an American rescue plan was developed, led by Army Capt. Lloyd G. Smith, 24, who was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. Under cover of darkness, he slipped onto the heavily guarded Albanian coast by boat and set up a base camp in a cave in the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic. Others joined him, and they moved inland to find the Americans. \n \n The British, meantime, organized a second rescue effort under Lt. Gavan Duffy, a secret agent who with a small team had reached Albania months earlier by parachute and on foot. Through partisan contacts, he found the Americans in eastern Albania and began leading them westward, intending to reach the coast. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But halfway there, at Gjirokaster, German troops blocked the way, and the Americans were too sick and exhausted to go on. He radioed for an American air rescue. Two C-47 cargo planes flew in with fighter escorts. But the Germans disrupted the landing, and Lieutenant Duffy called it off. \n \n The Americans, after the euphoria of nearly being rescued, were crushed. But they resumed their journey, and with American and British help reached the coast. On Jan. 9, after a 63-day ordeal, 27 Americans \u2014 10 nurses and 17 medics and fliers \u2014 boarded a British launch and crossed to Italy. \n \n Three nurses remained behind in German-occupied Berat. Captain Lloyd Smith brought them to safety in March 1944. They rode pack mules most of the way to the coast and were met by a torpedo boat, which took them across the Adriatic. \n \n After the war, Mr. Hayes returned to civilian life, attended Iowa State College and became an aeronautical engineer for North American Aviation, designing military planes and conducting studies for the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration until he retired in 1984. \n \n He married the former Betty Allen in 1944. She survives him, as do two daughters, Margaret Bleakley and Victoria Sprott; two brothers, Karl and James; a sister, Virginia McCall; two grandsons and a great-granddaughter. \n \n Harold Lyle Hayes was born in Pekin, Iowa, on April 11, 1922, to Ralph and Jenella Van Gorp Hayes. He graduated from high school in Indianola in 1940. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he was drafted, volunteered as a medic and by 1943 was in Sicily, flying evacuation missions. \n \n \u201cWhen he first returned to Allied lines, he had nightmares of being chased,\u201d Ms. Lineberry wrote of Mr. Hayes. \u201cThose faded with time, but as was true of many in the group, he rarely talked about his ordeal over the years.\u201d",

The 94-year-old, who died on Sunday, was the last survivor of 30 intrepid Americans who crash-landed behind Nazi lines during World War II, plunging them into a surreal odyssey that included German attacks, blizzards, illness, and near starvation as they trekked 600 miles until their eventual rescue 63 days later. Details of their saga was a \"long-held-secret\" for decades, the New York Times reports. It all began on a clear day in November 1943 when a cargo plane carrying nurses and medics from Sicily to Bari, Italy, was blown off course by a major storm and fired on by German flak guns. After ditching in a remote area, the group learned they were in Albania from locals. Under constant threat of capture, Hayes, then 21, and the others bunked with peasants with little to share except lice-infested blankets. They boiled tea from straw and ate berries. Their limbs froze as autumn gave way to white-out blizzards. \"When you're hungry, cold, and tired, you forget about almost everything else and are only thinking about surviving,\" Hayes said, per National Geographic. A British spy found them too sick to go on, and arranged a US air rescue that failed. Crushed, the group managed to continue moving west and reached the Adriatic coast on Jan. 9. To protect their Albanian saviors, they stayed mum during the war and for years after during the Communist years. Hayes \"rarely talked about his ordeal,\" author Cate Lineberry tells the Times.

    "document": "They are microscopic artwork: tiny tubes and long filaments, strange squiggles etched into some of the most ancient rocks known. \n \n On Wednesday, researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered, the remains of bacteria thriving on Earth not long, geologically speaking, after the very birth of the planet. If so, they offer evidence that life here got off to a very early start. \n \n But many experts in the field were skeptical of the new study \u2014 or downright unconvinced. \n \n Martin J. Van Kranendonk, a geologist at the University of New South Wales, called the patterns in the rocks \u201cdubiofossils\u201d \u2014 fossil-like structures, perhaps, but without clear proof that they started out as something alive. \n \n Heated disputes are nothing new in the search for the earliest life on Earth. In 1993 J. William Schopf, a paleontologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues found what that they, too, argued were the world\u2019s oldest fossils: chainlike blobs in 3.46 billion-year-old rocks made, they said, by bacteria. Other researchers later argued that the structures were just oddly shaped minerals. ||||| The study of life\u2019s history on Earth is an ongoing effort to follow the thread further and further back in time. As amazing and fascinating as a few billion years\u2019 worth of fossils are, we still ultimately want that Holy Grail that illuminates the origins of life on Earth. Unfortunately, that goal collides with the fact that the earliest evidence stands the least chance of being preserved through the eons for us to find. \n \n Each new find that purports to supplant the earliest known signs of life is virtually guaranteed to be controversial, subject to poking and prodding from skeptical scientists uncertain that every competing (non-living) explanation can be ruled out. Last August, for example, a paper claimed to show the remnants of stromatolites (small mounds built by communities of shallow water microorganisms) in 3.7 billion-year-old rocks in Greenland. Similar fossils from Australia that come in at about 3.5 billion years old are generally accepted as legit, but anything older is still subject to scientific debate. \n \n Now, a new study led by University College London PhD student Matthew Dodd describes evidence of what the researchers believe to be seafloor bacteria that lived at least 3.7 billion years ago. \n \n That evidence comes from rocks that are part of Quebec\u2019s Nuvvuagittuq belt, which contain some of the oldest rocks on the planet. They comprised an ancient seafloor made of volcanic rock, but there are also layers of iron minerals that precipitated out of the seawater. Those are believed to have formed near hydrothermal vents that gushed super-hot water laden with minerals. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks have proven hard to date, but they are known to be at least 3.77 billion years old, and could even be as old as 4.28 billion years\u2014very early indeed, considering that our planet formed only a little over 4.5 billion years ago. \n \n This is all further complicated by the fact that the Nuvvuagittuq rocks were metamorphosed under high temperature and pressure about 2.7 billion years ago. But within some jasper in the hydrothermal vent layers, the researchers found tiny tubes and filaments filled with hematite, an iron oxide mineral. The size and shape of these structures was fairly consistent (especially considering the metamorphic torture they\u2019ve endured), and some pairs of tubes were connected by small \u201cknobs.\u201d \n \n All this, the researchers say, is consistent with iron-oxidizing bacteria that we find at hydrothermal vents today, as well as slightly less ancient fossil examples. These bacteria build iron-oxide tubes around themselves and extend filaments out into their surroundings. \n \n Around these familiar-looking structures, there are some even tinier bits of carbon-rich material here and there. The ratio of different carbon isotopes that are present is one good way to tell biological carbon from other sources, as organisms have a preference for lighter isotopes. In this case, the carbon that can be found in the rock does fall within the biological range\u2014\u201calthough not unambiguously,\" the researchers write. \n \n There are also some blobs ringed with magnetite, which have been seen in other rocks recognized to contain these sorts of fossils. Several minerals can be found within the blobs, which also contain bits of carbon-rich material. The researchers think that this set of minerals reflects reactions between organic matter and the iron precipitating from the hydrothermal vents\u2014supporting a biological origin. \n \n If the researchers are right about what they\u2019ve found, this would be the oldest direct evidence of life we\u2019ve ever seen. What\u2019s more, if the recent discovery of stromatolites in Greenland also turns out to be the real deal, we would be able to say that there were at least two very different types of microorganisms living in very different parts of the ocean by 3.7 billion years ago. \n \n This new paper is particularly interesting because it involves hydrothermal vent environments, which have been proposed as a logical place where life on Earth could have had its origins. Any evidence supporting that idea also makes hydrothermal vents on other worlds look more and more like priority targets in the search for life beyond our home planet. \n \n Of course, it\u2019s best not to get too carried away in daydreams until we\u2019re more certain about what the researchers have found in these Canadian rocks. But the University of Western Australia\u2019s David Wacey, who was not involved in this new study, told Ars that the multiple lines of evidence presented make a pretty strong case. \u201cThe morphological comparisons with younger vent-dwelling organisms are quite striking and it is rather difficult to envisage how the microstructures shown [in the paper] could be formed in a purely abiotic scenario. \n \n \u201cThere will, no doubt, be arguments, and it may be many years before a consensus is reached, but this is how science progresses,\" Wacey added. \"I think it will be particularly important to understand more about the regional geology of the area and perhaps try to better constrain the age of these potential organisms. \n \n \u201cThe other exciting aspect of this report is that these potential microfossils are from a rock unit not previously studied for early life,\u201d he continued. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks might even be older than the rocks researchers have been looking at in Greenland, South Africa, and Australia, and they represent a different marine environment, too. \u201cThis new study once again gets us thinking about a potential hydrothermal cradle of life.\u201d \n \n Nature, 2017.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Researchers say they've found fossilized bacteria that may date back to shortly after the formation of the Earth (geologically speaking, anyway), the New York Times reports. They published their findings Wednesday in Nature. The rocks were collected in 2008 from the Nuvvuagittuq geological formation in Canada. The rocks are estimated to have formed near a hydrothermal vent on the seafloor between 3.77 billion and 4.22 billion years ago. They contain tiny filaments and tubes, some connected by knobs, that resemble younger bacteria fossils created near hydrothermal vents. They also contain a level of carbon indicative of a living organism. If the fossils are what researchers say they are\u2014and not everyone is convinced they are\u2014they would push the date of earliest known life back billions of years. Currently the oldest fossilized bacteria widely accepted as legitimate are 3.5 billion years old and come from Australia, Ars Technica reports. And if these Canadian fossils are closer to 4.22 billion years old, it means the bacteria would have been alive just 340 million years after the formation of the Earth. Still, every new claim of finding the world's oldest fossilized life is met with skepticism, and this discovery is no different. One expert calls the rocks \"dubiofossils,\" fossil-like but not clearly evidence of an organism. In response, researchers argue there's too much evidence in favor of their conclusion to ignore.

The team from University College London found the telltale signs of the seafloor bacteria in rocks in Quebec that are part of the Nuvvuagittuq belt, some of the oldest rocks on the planet. The rocks are known to be at least 3.77 billion years old, and could be as old as 4.28 billion years\u2014very early indeed, considering that our planet formed only a little over 4.5 billion years earlier. But the rocks were exposed to high temperatures and pressure for about 2.7 billion years before the bacteria were exposed. The researchers believe the bacteria built iron-oxide tubes around themselves and extended filaments out into their surroundings. The ratio of different carbon isotopes present in the rocks is a good way to determine biological carbon from other sources, \"as organisms have a preference for lighter isotopes,\" the researchers write. The carbon that can be found in the rock does fall within the biological range\u2014\"although not unambiguously,\" they write.

If true, it would mean there were two kinds of microorganisms living in very different parts of the ocean at the same time, and the discovery of stromatolites in Greenland also supports the idea of two very different types of microorganisms.

    "document": "While frustrated California detectives looked fruitlessly for a man accused of brutally raping 45 women and killing a dozen more people, one of his relatives was likely busy seeking information to unite a big family tree. \n \n Their colliding searches lead to the momentous arrest Tuesday of Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, the suspected Golden State Killer who eluded law enforcement for four decades. \n \n The bulk of the information detectives used to help capture DeAngelo came from a no-frills \u201copen-source\u201d genealogy website called GEDmatch that allows users to voluntarily share their genetic profiles for free. \n \n The Florida-based website that pools raw genetic profiles that people share publicly to find long-lost relatives was the team\u2019s biggest tool, said lead investigator Paul Holes, a cold case expert and retired Contra Costa County District Attorney inspector who\u2019s spent about seven years using such websites to identify the California killer. \n \n The website revealed a \u201cdistant relative\u201d early this year that helped lead authorities to DeAngelo, who was arrested at his Citrus Heights home on suspicion of conducting a reign of terror up and down California, including 12 homicides, 45 rapes and more than 100 residential burglaries between 1976 and 1986, investigators said. \n \n That information made it possible for police to focus their search, supplemented by other clues, like ethnicity, height and where he lived at the time. Then they did surveillance and retrieved new evidence \u2014 such as saliva on a restaurant dish or a discarded beer can, cigarette or Kleenex \u2013 for a more direct DNA match, leading to his arrest. \n \n The case sheds light on a little known fact: Even if we\u2019ve never spit into a test tube, some of our genetic information may be public \u2014 and accessible to law enforcement. That\u2019s because whenever one of our relatives \u2014 even distant, distant kin \u2014 submits their DNA to a public site hoping to find far-flung relations, some of our data is shared as well. \n \n \u201cWhen you put your information into a database voluntarily, and law enforcement has access to it, you may be unwittingly exposing your relatives \u2014 some you know, some you don\u2019t know \u2014 to scrutiny by law enforcement. Even though they may have done nothing wrong,\u201d said Andrea Roth, assistant professor of law at UC Berkeley Boalt School of Law and an expert on the use of forensic science in criminal trials. \n \n And even companies that promise privacy may be required to surrender your genetic data if confronted with a search warrant. \n \n \u201cAs more and more genetic information becomes available, its possible use in criminal investigations becomes more and more feasible, both for direct checking and familial checking,\u201d said Stanford University School of Law professor and bioethicist Hank Greely, director of Stanford\u2019s Center for Law and the Biosciences. \u201cThat\u2019s true whether it\u2019s a genealogy database, electronic health record or research.\u201d \n \n Holes began his search six years ago on Ysearch.org, a similar website as GEDmatch. Last March, Holes narrowed it down to an elderly man in Oregon, but he knew it was a \u201cweak match,\u201d he said. \n \n Court records obtained by the Associated Press show that in March 2017 investigators in Clackamas County, Oregon, convinced a judge to order the 73-year-old man to provide a DNA sample. The documents said they used a genetic profile based off DNA from crime scenes linked to the serial killer and compared it to information from genealogical websites. The man turned out to be innocent. \n \n \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Holes said. \u201cWe generated the legal documentation more as a matter of routine, due diligence \u2026 But he was willing all along to provide his DNA. \n \n \u201cI knew it was a weak match. After six years it was our only match,\u201d he said, adding that Golden State Killer and the Oregon man shared an unusual genetic trait. \n \n After that failure, Hole said he \u201crecalibrated\u201d and used his own family member\u2019s DNA profile from Ancestry to start learning how to use GEDmatch. He was confident the new technology would provide answers and he visited the agencies touched by the serial killer\u2019s crimes to convince them to provide some DNA for his new tactic. Ventura County offered some DNA, but to submit DeAngelo\u2019s data to the GEDmatch, investigators would have to put it in a format that would be recognized by the website and uploaded it to the site for analysis, said CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist who has used the site in thousands of adoption cases. \n \n The site returns a list of relatives \u2014 with names and emails \u2014 by degree of shared single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, which offer a genetic fingerprint. On average, you share 50 percent of your SNPs with a sibling, 25 percent with a half sibling, 12.5 percent with a first cousin, and 3.1 percent with a second cousin. The numbers diminish after that. \n \n \u201cThey had luck, and they had skill,\u201d said Moore, who owns a company called The DNA Detectives. \n \n The hits on DeAngelo came from third and fourth cousins, Holes said. Family members directly related to DeAngelo\u2019s great, great, great, great grandfather dating back to the 1800s when families would often have 15 kids. Holes and his team built out more than 25 different family trees. The tree that eventually linked to the Golden State Killer was so large, it contained about 1,000 people, he said. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with any other case used to capture someone like this,\u201d Holes said. \n \n California law limits such \u201cfamilial searching\u201d using the state\u2019s criminal DNA database. And major companies, such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com, require a court order for law enforcement to access DNA files stored in their databases. \n \n But there are no legal restrictions against accessing the 900,000 DNA files on the public GEDmatch database, created when consumers take information from commercial testing companies, such as 23andme, then upload it to the volunteer-run database. \n \n That openness is what makes the site so useful, said Moore. Because so many people contribute data, vast family trees can be built. \n \n \u201cThe majority of companies do a really good job of protecting the genetic privacy of customers,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut if a company allows the uploading of files from other sources, that opens the door up for other types of uses.\u201d \n \n On Friday, GEDmatch operator Curtis Rogers released a statement saying his company was unaware of the search for the East Area Rapist using his site. \n \n \u201cWe understand that the GEDmatch database was used to help identify the Golden State Killer,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch\u2019s policy to inform users that the database could be used for other uses, as set forth in the Site Policy \u2026 While the database was created for genealogical research, it is important that GEDmatch participants understand the possible uses of their DNA, including identification of relatives that have committed crimes or were victims of crimes.\u201d \n \n Rogers continued to say if anyone had concerns that their profiles might be used for \u201cnon-genealogical uses\u201d they should remove it from the site or not upload it in the first place. He provided an email address to delete profiles. \n \n The site does not specifically address law enforcement searches, but it stresses that it \u201ccannot guarantee that your information will never be accessed by unintended means.\u201d \n \n One of the earliest uses of this approach helped detectives reopen the killing of a 20-year-old woman in Wales. In 2002, data from a 14-year-old boy in Britain\u2019s database of offenders led authorities to his uncle. In 2010, a DNA sample from the son of California\u2019s \u201cGrim Sleeper\u201d serial killer Lonnie David Franklin Jr. led to his arrest and conviction. The son had been jailed on weapons charges. \n \n The East Area Rapist/Golden State Killer case shows the promise and potential peril of DNA as a law enforcement tool, said UC Berkeley\u2019s Roth. \n \n \u201cThe promise is that it\u2019s a wonderful thing that police were able to find this person,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the potential concern is that the government is looking at a lot of genetic information that most of us probably want to keep private. \n \n \u201cAnd even though it is easy to think of this technology as something that is used just to track down serial killers,\u201d she said, \u201cIf we allow the government to use it with no accountability or no further safeguards, then all of our genetic information might be at risk for being used for things we don\u2019t want it to be used for.\u201d \n \n Staff writer Julia Prodis Sulek contributed to this report. ||||| Sacramento investigators tracked down East Area Rapist suspect Joseph James DeAngelo using genealogical websites that contained genetic information from a relative, the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office confirmed Thursday. \n \n The effort was part of a painstaking process that began by using DNA from one of the crime scenes from years ago and comparing it to genetic profiles available online through various websites that cater to individuals wanting to know more about their family backgrounds by accepting DNA samples, said Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi. \n \n Paul Holes, a retired investigator with the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office, confirmed Friday that he used \"open-source\" site GEDmatch to help law enforcement make the DNA connection. \n \n The investigation was conducted over a long period of time as officials in Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert's office and crime lab explored online family trees that appeared to match DNA samples from the East Area Rapist's crimes, Grippi said. They then followed clues to individuals in the family trees to determine whether they were potential suspects. \n \n Digital Access for only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. \n \n The process finally came to fruition last Thursday, when the investigation focused on the possibility that DeAngelo might be a suspect, a suspicion bolstered by the fact that he had lived in areas where the attacks occurred and was in the right age range, Grippi said. \n \n Schubert said in an interview at her office that the April 19 determination that DeAngelo might be a suspect set the investigation into high gear. \n \n Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones' investigators set up surveillance on DeAngelo in his quiet Citrus Heights neighborhood and obtained his DNA from something he discarded. \n \n The crime lab began testing the material and Schubert said she got a call last Friday night from Grippi while she was at a high school fundraiser telling her that the DeAngelo DNA matched that found at decades-old murder scenes in Ventura and Orange counties. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I was at a dinner at Cristo Rey High School and Steve Grippi called me,\" she said. \"And so I probably used a few words I wouldn't put in a newspaper, but basically said, 'You'd better not be lying to me.'\" \n \n The sample provided \"overwhelming evidence that it was him,\" Schubert said, but she decided they wanted a second sample, which sheriff's officials recovered. \n \n The results from testing that second sample came in while Schubert was in her office Monday night, she said. \n \n \"The second sample was astronomical evidence that it was him,\" Schubert said, adding, \"There were a whole lot of holy s--- moments.\" \n \n Authorities began moving quickly to plan the arrest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"We wanted to be able to move quickly because it wasn't like he was in custody somewhere,\" she said, adding that she didn't tell all prosecutors with unsolved crimes around the state in an effort to keep the discovery secret. \"Not all the DAs knew at the time that the arrest was made,\" she said. \"I think it's a fair statement that it was closely held. \"There were concerns about public safety in terms of if he figured out something was going on.\" DeAngelo was arrested outside his home Tuesday afternoon and booked into the county jail on two charges of murder in the February 1978 slayings of Katie and Brian Maggiore in Rancho Cordova. \n \n \n \n He is expected to face charges in 12 homicide cases in Sacramento, Orange, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties stemming from a rape and slaying spree that authorities say stretched from 1974 through May 1986. DeAngelo faces arraignment in Sacramento Superior Court on Friday, but authorities still must determine where he ultimately will stand trial and whether he faces death penalty prosecutions. Some of the murders were committed at a time when the death penalty had been ruled unconstitutional, but others are eligible. Schubert said she wants to meet with prosecutors from the counties where DeAngelo is suspected of murders and plan a joint prosecution similar to that used in the Luis Bracamontes cop-killing trial that ended with a death penalty sentence on Wednesday. Bracamontes killed deputies in Sacramento and Placer counties in 2014, and was jointly prosecuted in Sacramento by Rod Norgaard from Schubert's office and Dave Tellman from the Placer DA's office. \"It makes sense to do it in one county,\" she said, adding that the case could be moved to Southern California because 10 of the 12 murder victims were killed there. \"The majority of the murders happened down in Southern California, so I'm comfortable with wherever it's going to be as long as everybody gets to be a participant,\" she said. Prosecutors also must grapple with whether to file rape charges against DeAngelo because for many cases the statute of limitations has expired. \n \n \n \n Sacramento prosecutors do not currently plan to file such charges. In Santa Clara County, where the East Area Rapist was linked to two rapes in San Jose in 1978, the district attorney's office said it would not seek to prosecute DeAngelo because the statute of limitations had expired. But other jurisdictions are considering it, including Yolo County, where authorities said Thursday they are investigating three rapes in Davis nearly 40 years ago they suspect were committed by DeAngelo. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig indicated in a written statement he would seek to prosecute DeAngelo in connection with the Davis attacks, the first prosecutor in the state to announce such plans. Reisig said his office would work with Schubert, the FBI and Davis police \u201cto solve the Davis rapes, vigorously prosecute the rapist and achieve some sense of justice for the victims, family members and the Davis community.\u201d Contra Costa County's district attorney is working with police agencies there to investigate whether DeAngelo committed nine sexual assaults in that county between 1978 and 1979, DA spokesman Scott Alonso said. Alonso said the statute of limitations may present a challenge. He said the office is evaluating cases with the county sheriff and police in Concord, Danville and Walnut Creek, where attacks linked to the East Area Rapist occurred. \"I think we're very interested in pursuing justice for the victims in these cases and pursue what we can file under the statute of limitations,\" Alonso said. \"We want to see justice for these terrible crimes.\" The East Area Rapist is believed to have killed 12 people, raped at least 51 and burglarized hundreds of homes from 1974 through May 1986 along the length of California. News that a suspect had been arrested in the 44-year-old mystery set off a frenzy of calls to the DA's office from news outlets around the world, and left Schubert reaching out to victims and investigators who had spent decades working to solve the case. Schubert, who grew up in Sacramento and was 12 when the attacks began, said her brother recalled their father buying a gun because of the rapes and that her mother slept with a knife under her pillow. The realization that the case might finally have been solved - and that it involved a man who had lived in Sacramento undetected for decades - comes 18 years after Schubert convinced her bosses in the DA's office to let her begin a cold case investigations unit and two years after she formed a statewide task force to focus efforts on the case. \"It's just surreal, so many years of people waiting...,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a big deal. It's a moment in time that I don't think anybody's going to forget...Everybody here understands the significance of this case.\"",

She says she plans to meet with prosecutors from the counties where DeAngelo is expected to face charges. \"It makes sense to do it in one county,\" she says, adding that the case could be moved to Southern California because 10 of the 12 murder victims were killed there. DeAngelo faces murder charges in Sacramento, Orange,",

    "document": "Defense Secretary Ash Carter caused a stir Tuesday when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the $500 million program to train and equip \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels to take on the Islamic State had so far yielded just 60 vetted candidates. \n \n Republicans quickly pounced on the number \u2014 far short of a goal for at least 5,400 fighters in the first year \u2014 as evidence that President Barack Obama\u2019s strategy for defeating the terrorist group isn\u2019t working, a day after the president defended the plan at a rare Pentagon press briefing. And Democrats quickly went into damage-control mode, noting there are valid reasons the number is so small. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) let Carter know during the Senate hearing that his remark had caused a ruckus on cable news, saying he\u2019d just stepped out of the hearing for an appearance on CNN, and all the interviewer wanted to talk about, Nelson said, was Carter\u2019s statement. \n \n The Pentagon chief acknowledged he\u2019d caused a firestorm, saying he wasn\u2019t surprised by all the attention his statement was getting but noting that Congress deserved \u201cto know where things stand.\u201d \n \n It wasn\u2019t exactly the headline the White House was looking for the day after Obama reaffirmed at the Pentagon that his strategy to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was working, especially with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasting the president\u2019s commitment to the strategy as delusional. \n \n But Carter\u2019s acknowledgement that so few Syrians have made it through the vetting process also led a number of senators on both sides of the aisle to raise important questions about the viability of the train-and-equip program, asking why it\u2019s so difficult to find moderate rebels willing to take on ISIL. \n \n Among the problems: stringent vetting standards, the U.S. requirement that rebels be willing to fight ISIL but not Syrian President Bashar Assad and the lack of a U.S. commitment to defend these troops from Assad\u2019s advanced weapons. \n \n Carter told the Armed Services panel that about 7,000 volunteers were being screened for the train-and-equip program but that the vetting standards were slowing things down. \n \n The first problem is the basic vetting, which involves background checks, proof of identification and a pledge to obey the basic laws of war. Some volunteers have been booted from the program for simple reasons such as not meeting age requirements, one defense official told POLITICO, while others could not pass one or more layers of screening to protect the U.S. and allied troops conducting the effort. \n \n The second problem is the requirement that the Syrian volunteers must agree only to fight ISIL and not the Assad regime. U.S. officials say the \u201cISIL-first\u201d strategy is essential because without a political structure in place to replace Assad if he died or left power, chaos in Syria would worsen and the state would fail, like in Libya. \n \n But many Syrians who have been brutalized in the civil war bear more animus toward Assad than toward ISIL, which is one reason why the \u201cISIL-first\u201d commitment has winnowed out so many people who came forward. \n \n Still, Pentagon officials say they\u2019re optimistic about increasing the throughput at the four sites that have been created for the train-and-equip effort in Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \n \n \u201cAs training progresses, we are learning more about the opposition groups and building important relationships, which increases our ability to attract recruits and provides valuable intelligence for counter-ISIL operations,\u201d Carter said. \n \n McCain and other Republicans on the panel were unmoved. \n \n \u201cIt is not that we are doing nothing,\u201d the Arizona senator said. \u201cIt is that there is no compelling reason to believe that anything we are currently doing will be sufficient to achieve the president\u2019s stated goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL \u2014 either in the short term or the long term.\u201d \n \n And he suggested there\u2019s another major reason the U.S. has been having so much trouble with the \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian force \u2014 it won\u2019t make any solid commitments to the people it\u2019s recruiting. \n \n Unresolved questions about the support the U.S. would give the fighters have split the Obama administration for years, leading in part to the dismissal of Carter\u2019s predecessor, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, who appeared with Carter before the committee Tuesday, acknowledged that a \u201cdebate\u201d inside the administration continues about the effect that Assad has on the fight and to what degree his departure would help or hurt it. \n \n For McCain and other critics, the problems are more basic: People won\u2019t sign up to risk their lives unless they\u2019re certain the U.S. is willing to provide air cover, resupply them with ammunition and supplies, and offer other types of support, he said. McCain mocked Carter\u2019s answer about the administration\u2019s absence of a policy, saying that no wonder Syrians wouldn\u2019t agree to join if the answer they got was that a \u201cdecision will be made later.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s shameful to send people in and not assure them that we will defend them from attacks by barrel bombs,\u201d McCain said. \n \n McCain, who has been Obama\u2019s foremost foreign-policy critic, had several other heated exchanges with Carter during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. The Pentagon chief sought to provide some cover for the president by offering examples of progress in the U.S.-led campaign to defeat the terrorist group that has declared its own state. \n \n Carter said the more than 5,000 airstrikes carried out by the United States and its coalition partners have \u201cproduced some clear tactical results,\u201d putting ISIL \u201con the defensive,\u201d with \u201cits stronghold in Raqqah under pressure.\u201d \n \n But the defense secretary also acknowledged setbacks, making clear the administration was not even close to where it had hoped to be in its efforts to train Iraqi and Syrian forces. \n \n As of June 30, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve only received enough trainees to be able to train\u201d about 10,800 Iraqi troops, with an additional 4,600 in training. \u201cI\u2019ve told Iraqi leaders that while the United States is open to supporting Iraq more than we already are, we must see a greater commitment from all parts of the Iraqi government,\u201d Carter said. \n \n And in Syria, he explained, the administration\u2019s efforts to train and equip a force to take on ISIL were still in the \u201cearly stages.\u201d \n \n \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s comments yesterday at the Pentagon reveal a disturbing degree of self-delusion,\u201d McCain said. \u201cNone of the so-called progress that the president cited suggests that we are on a path to success.\u201d \n \n Several Democrats stepped in to defend the defense secretary, including the panel\u2019s ranking member, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \n \n \u201cThe pipeline is about 7,000,\u201d Reed told POLITICO. \u201cFrom that I think you\u2019ll start seeing increased numbers. And then when you reach a critical mass, you start raising the question of where are they deployed, how are they deployed, are they supported.\u201d \n \n But, Reed was quick to add, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time.\u201d ||||| WASHINGTON The United States was only training about 60 Syrian opposition fighters to battle Islamic State as of July 3, far below expectations, Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Congress on Tuesday, citing rigorous U.S. vetting of recruits. \n \n The program, which launched in May in Jordan and Turkey, was designed to train as many as 5,400 fighters a year and seen as a test of President Barack Obama's strategy of engaging local partners to combat extremists. \n \n Carter's acknowledgement of the low number of recruits will give ammunition to critics who say Obama's strategy is too limited to have any influence on Syria's brutal civil war. \n \n \"Given the poor numbers of recruited and trained Syrian fighters thus far, I am doubtful we can achieve our goal of training a few thousand this year,\" said Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \n \n Some Syrian rebel leaders say the force the United States is training risks sowing divisions and cannot succeed without directly targeting Syrian government forces, who are currently off-limits for U.S. offensive operations. \n \n The top Democrat on the committee, Senator Jack Reed, said Islamic State \"remains the dominant force in western Syria.\" \n \n \"Absent a moderate opposition that is willing to and capable of taking territory from ISIL and holding it, any change in the status quo is unlikely,\" he said, using an acronym for the group. \n \n Obama was briefed by his top military commanders at the Pentagon on Monday. He said at a news conference later that \"we will do more to train and equip the moderate opposition in Syria\" but did not offer details. \n \n Carter told Congress the number of recruits would increase as the United States learned how to better streamline vetting. \n \n \"We are also refining our curriculum, expanding our outreach to the moderate opposition, and incorporating lessons learned \n \n from the first training class,\" Carter said. \n \n Obama has yet to announce whether he will go beyond resupplying and financing the proxy force, and protect them with U.S. fighter jets if they clash with Assad's forces. The United States is already conducting near daily air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. \n \n Carter said he believed the Syrian recruits needed some U.S. protection but said no decisions had been made on what assistance to provide. \n \n (Reporting by Phil Stewart and David Alexander; Editing by Doina Chiacu)",

    "document": "WASHINGTON/BERLIN (Reuters) - A 95-year old New York City man believed to be a former guard at a labor camp in Nazi-occupied Poland has arrived in Germany after being arrested and deported by U.S. immigration authorities, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. \n \n The White House said Jakiw Palij had served as a guard at the Trawniki Labor Camp, where about 6,000 Jewish men, women and children were shot dead on Nov. 3, 1943, in one of the single largest massacres of the Holocaust. \n \n The United States had been trying to get Palij out of the country since the issue of a 2004 deportation order, but after talks with top members of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government Germany agreed to take him in. \n \n Palij was taken to a home for the elderly in the western town of Ahlen, some 130 kilometers northeast of Dusseldorf. \n \n Born in what was then Poland but is now Ukraine, Palij emigrated to the United States in 1949, becoming a United States citizen eight years later, the White House said. \n \n But, it added, he had concealed his Nazi service and involvement in human rights abuses, saying he had spent World War Two working on a farm and in a factory. \n \n In 2001, Palij told Department of Justice officials that he had trained at the Nazi SS Training Camp in Trawniki, in German-occupied Poland, in 1943, the White House said. \n \n \u201cBy serving as an armed guard ... and preventing the escape of Jewish prisoner during his Nazi service, Palij played an indispensable role in ensuring the Trawniki Jewish victims met their horrific fate at the hands of the Nazis,\u201d the White House said. \n \n A federal judge revoked his U.S. citizenship in 2003 and he was ordered to be deported in 2004. But no European country would accept him, CNN and New York magazine reported. \n \n Given his age and questions over his health and also a possible lack of proof, it is unclear whether German authorities will attempt to prosecute the stateless pensioner. \n \n \u201cIn Germany, being a member of a criminal organization like the (Nazi) SS is not enough to be prosecuted. Even being trained at a camp is not sufficient,\u201d said Jens Rommel, Germany\u2019s top Nazi hunter. \u201cThe participation in or facilitation of a murder must be proven.\u201d \n \n MORAL RESPONSIBILITY \n \n The U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said the deportation was the result of a concerted effort by U.S. President Donald Trump. \n \n \u201cHe (Trump) told me directly to make it a priority, to get the Nazi out,\u201d Grenell told reporters. \u201cI felt very strongly that the German government had a moral obligation and they accepted that,\u201d he added, making clear it was up to Germany to decide whether to prosecute him. \n \n Germany has a mixed record on convicting Nazi war criminals. Critics say it let many high-ranking Nazis and SS members escaped justice only for their juniors, small cogs in the Nazi death machine, to be put on trial decades later. \n \n Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who on Monday visited the Auschwitz camp, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \n \n \u201cGermany, in whose name the worst injustice was perpetrated under the Nazis, is confronting its moral obligations.\u201d \n \n After an international military tribunal put some top Nazi leaders, including Hermann Goering and Rudolf Hess, on trial soon after World War Two in the Nuremburg Trials, little action was taken by the West German judiciary in the 1950s and 1960s. \n \n Between 1945 and 2005, West German courts convicted 6,656 Nazi criminals out of more than 36,000 investigations into more than 170,000 suspects, a study showed in 2008. \n \n Germany\u2019s Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Ludwigsburg is still investigating individuals after the 2011 conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk gave it a new impetus. It was the first time involvement in a camp was sufficient to be found culpable even without proof of a specific crime. \n \n \u201cThere are currently no preliminary proceedings in Germany and there is no arrest warrant,\u201d said Rommel, who heads the office. \u201cWe therefore have to wait (to see) whether there will be a new evaluation or whether new evidence appears to underpin the suspicion ... In the case of Palij we are unable to prove where, when and which unit he was in after his training.\u201d \n \n Jakiw Palij, a 95-year old New York City man believed to be a former guard at a labor camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, is pictured in his 1949 visa photo. U.S. Department of Justice/via REUTERS ||||| \u201cWe could see from the names and military identification numbers that these were men who were at the camp when the Germans abandoned the camp in 1944,\u201d Mr. Black said. \n \n From 1941 through 1945, roughly 3 million Jewish adults and children were murdered in Poland, according to Walter Reich, the former director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \n \n Before arriving in the United States, the three men worked as guards in their unit, which was part of the Streibel Battalion, according to court records. All three guarded forced laborers who made uniforms and brushes, Mr. Black said. Their unit also conducted bloody reprisal campaigns against Polish partisans in the region around the town of Lublin, but Mr. Black said the Justice Department could not confirm whether the men took part in such operations. \n \n Image Mr. Palij\u2019s citizenship was revoked in 2003 after the Justice Department realized he had lied on his application. Credit National Archives at New York City, via Associated Press \n \n When Mr. Palij and Mr. Bilaniuk arrived in the United States in summer of 1949, they ended up settling a dozen miles apart in Queens. Their colleague Mr. Wasylyk moved to the Ulster County village of Ellenville, where he ran a bungalow community that had mostly Jewish summer renters. \n \n It was not until the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that United States law-enforcement authorities figured out who they were after finding the cache of Nazi records in Czechoslovakia. \n \n The Department of Justice accused all three of serving in the SS in Trawniki, and filed charges to take away their American passports and order them deported. All told, the Justice Department successfully charged and denaturalized 16 former SS members who served at Trawniki.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Now that former Nazi prison guard Jakiw Palij is out of the US, the New York Times explores how he got in, and it wasn't through his efforts alone. As Nazi records of his SS membership weren't uncovered until the 1990s, Palij successfully applied for a visa under the Displaced Persons Act at the American consular office in Schweinfurt, Germany, in June 1949 alongside Jaroslaw Bilaniuk, whose SS identification number turned out to be only one digit away from Palij's, says Peter Black, a former Justice Department historian who worked on Nazi deportation cases. Both claimed to have worked in Germany during the war\u2014Palij as a factory worker, Bilaniuk as a farmhand. Mykola Wasylyk, who also served with the men at the Trawniki labor camp and who'd already arrived in the US after securing a visa, vouched for both. The records suggest Palij and Bilaniuk weren't coerced into joining the SS as Palij later claimed, but volunteered together in February 1943. Together with Wasylyk, they guarded prisoners who made uniforms and brushes at Trawniki, says Black, a camp known for having executed 6,000 Jews in a single day in November 1943. Upon their arrival in the US, Palij and Bilaniuk settled 100 miles from Wasylyk in Queens, NY. Bilaniuk and Wasylyk would each die in the US, even after officials uncovered their true past.

(AP) \u2014 Strict rules adopted at the height of California's drought leading many people to let their lawns turn brown may soon end as state regulators Wednesday consider letting local communities decide how to keep their own water use in check. \n \n That's good news to Southern California landscaper Greg Gritters, who says local water officials are best suited to manage their supplies. \n \n His clients have had to choose between keeping their lawns green at the expense of huge water bills or turning down their sprinklers and watch their yard turn brown. \n \n \"Either way they're unhappy,\" said Gritters, owner of Vintage Landscape in the Coachella Valley. \"There's lots of unhappy people since the drought went into effect.\" \n \n A proposal before the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento would allow local districts to compare their water supplies with how much they anticipate needing if drought continues for three more years. \n \n Cities and water districts will set their conservation targets based on the difference between the anticipated supply and demand. The proposed regulation would extend to January. \n \n The Irvine Ranch Water District in Orange County led the push for a regional approach. Fiona Sanchez, director of water resources for the district, said she is confident that districts statewide will carefully study their supply and demand ratio. \n \n \"If agencies are not taking it seriously, it will be very evident they can't meet their customers' demands,\" she said. \n \n Some districts may set strict conservation goals for residents and businesses, while others could determine it is time to lift conservation mandates. \n \n California is in its fifth year of drought, but regulators are considering the new approach as El Nino storms delivered nearly average amounts of rain and snow this winter in Northern California, filling key reservoirs. \n \n Southern California, however, remains deep in drought, and it's unclear what the future will bring. \n \n Bans on wasting water by washing sidewalks with a hose or washing cars without a shut-off nozzle would become permanent under the proposed regulation. \n \n Max Gomberg, a senior climate scientist for the state water board, said Californians understand the drought remains critical. He doesn't expect people to suddenly begin wasting water with any changes. \n \n \"Californians have shown that when there's a serious drought and a need to conserve, people step up and pitch in,\" he said. \"We're confident that people are going to continue practicing their conservation habits.\" ||||| 0:31 Golden 1 Center doors open, cowbells clang for Kings home opener Pause \n \n 1:15 Turkeys gone wild in Davis \n \n 0:42 McClatchy High School students fight to save newspaper \n \n 1:08 Driving to Golden 1 Center?

Now many of those restrictions are about to be dismissed, with a reversal of the state mandate for a 25% drop in city water use, the New York Times reports. Instead, thanks to the hard work of everyday Californians and a precipitation-filled winter that partly restocked the area's reservoirs and mountain snowpacks, the State Water Resources Control Board is rolling back its rules on keeping tabs on how long people shower or water their lawns, allowing local communities to come up with their own conservation methods. \"We are still in a drought, but we are no longer in the-worst-snow-pack-in-500-years drought,\" says Felicia Marcus, the head of the SWRCB. By putting the conservation power back into the hands of each community as of June 1, those areas can come up with the best plan based on their particular area's water supply, which varies greatly from place to place. But a climate manager on the water board warns this is still just a trial run, with the National Drought Mitigation Center noting in the Sacramento Bee that 70% of the state is still in \"severe,\" \"extreme,\" or \"exceptional\" drought. The AP notes that certain bans, such as spraying down sidewalks with a hose, will permanently remain.",

    "document": "Another schoolgirl kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014 was released Thursday, two days after Amina Ali Darsha Nkeki was found by vigilante militant group \n \n A second schoolgirl kidnapped by Boko Haram from the north-eastern Nigerian town of Chibok in 2014 has been freed, according to the Nigerian military. \n \n An army spokesman said that Serah Luka had been \u201crescued\u201d on Thursday morning, along with 96 other women and children held captive by Boko Haram. The spokesman, Sani Kukasheka Usman, said that 35 Boko Haram fighters had also been killed in \u201cclearance operations\u201d. \n \n If the claim is true, she would be the second of the Chibok girls to escape a Boko Haram camp in Sambisa forest in the past two days. \n \n \u201cShe is believed to be the daughter of Pastor Luka,\u201d Usman said in a statement. \u201cDuring debriefing the girl revealed that she was a student of the [Chibok] school at the time they were abducted. She further added that she hails from Madagali, Adamawa State.\u201d The statement said the girl had only joined the school just over two months before her abduction. \n \n Luka is currently receiving medical treatment in Borno state where she was found, the spokesman said. \n \n The first girl to escape, Amina Ali Darsha Nkeki, met President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday. She had been found by members of a vigilante group on Tuesday on the edge of a Boko Haram stronghold after fleeing during an attack on the militants\u2019 camp. \n \n On Thursday she was flown to Abuja in the presidential jet to meet Buhari. In a press conference at the presidential villa while waiting for the president to arrive, Nkeki first hid her face from the cameras, then greeted Buhari and handed him her four-month-old baby girl, born in captivity. \n \n The president pledged to continue the search for the remaining Chibok girls who have not been recovered \u2013 who number more than 200 \u2013 and to fund Nkeki\u2019s education, in a statement released after the meeting. \n \n \n \n \u201cLike all Nigerians and many others around the world, I am delighted at the news that Amina Ali Nkeki, one of the missing Chibok girls, has regained her freedom,\u201d Buhari said. \u201cBut my feelings are tinged with deep sadness at the horrors the young girl has had to go through at such an early stage in her life.\u201d \n \n He promised Nkeki \u201cthe best care\u201d that the Nigerian government could afford. \u201cWe will ensure that she gets the best medical, psychological, emotional and whatever other care she requires to make a full recovery and be reintegrated fully into society,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cAmina must be enabled to go back to school. No girl in Nigeria should be put through the brutality of forced marriage. Every girl has the right to an education and a life choice.\u201d \n \n Buhari said that Nkeki offered his government \u201ca unique opportunity for vital information\u201d that could lead to the release of the rest of the Chibok girls, though he said nothing of the estimated 2,000 other women and girls that have been captured by Boko Haram. \n \n Nkeki\u2019s brother, Inua Ali, who was also at the meeting, confirmed to the Guardian that the president had pledged to look after Nkeki and her family. \u201cWe saw and met with the president today,\u201d he said. \u201cHe promised to cater for my sister, her daughter and my mother. He promised to put my sister back in school.\u201d \n \n \n \n In her first two days of freedom, Nkeki has met dozens of Nigerian dignitaries. \n \n After being briefly allowed home so that her family could identify her, she was airlifted to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. She and her baby had medical checks and met trauma specialists before being flown to Abuja. \n \n Chibok abductions: first girl found, say Nigerian activists Read more \n \n Nkeki\u2019s age is not known \u2013 her brother said she was born in 1995, but according to other reports she was 17 when she was abducted and is now 19. \n \n \n \n In what commentators called a \u201cdesperate bid to claim credit\u201d for the escape of the first of the Chibok girls since the messy aftermath of the 2014 abductions, the Nigerian army on Wednesday said it had rescued a girl it identified as Falmata Mbalala. \n \n It later admitted that her name was actually Amina Ali and said its troops had rescued her in conjunction with Civilian JTF, the local vigilante force that arms itself with muskets and catapults. \n \n Abdul Amin Mahmud, a Nigerian commentator and lawyer, criticised the government for attempting to claim credit and for parading her at the press conference. \n \n \u201cShe was roughly handled by the Nigerian army, and she\u2019s a young girl who\u2019s been in captivity for two years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe girl is not a trophy. She\u2019s not the elephant man to be paraded at a circus. She has gone through real psychological trauma. She needs care. They transferred her to the governor\u2019s house and to Abuja to meet the president \u2013 for what? \n \n \u201cThe issue of the missing Chibok girls has become a political issue. The previous government did nothing, so if the current government can rescue one, it\u2019s seen as a political victory. I worry about the future of these young girls.\u201d \n \n In contrast to the government\u2019s claims of rescue, Nkeki\u2019s brother said she had been found trying to hide from the vigilantes after running away from the Boko Haram camp. He said she had been brought back to her family home for a tearful reunion with her elderly, widowed mother, Binta Ali. Onlookers said that Ali shouted \u201cAmina! Amina!\u201d when she saw her, and that they nearly fell over as they hugged each other. \n \n \n \n According to activists, Nkeki said the rest of the Chibok girls were in the forest except for six, apparently killed in the same attack she had tried to escape. It is unclear who launched the attack on the Boko Haram camp; the army did not claim responsibility for it. \n \n When she was found, Nkeki was with a man who claimed to be her husband, Mohammed Hayatu, whom the army suspect is a Boko Haram fighter. Hayatu was not at the presidential villa but was being investigated, according to Usman. \n \n \u201cIt should be noted that Mohammed Hayatu is well treated in line with Operation Lafiya Dole\u2019s rules of engagement regarding insurgents who voluntarily surrender to the military,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n Given Buhari\u2019s claim in December that Boko Haram had \u201ctechnically\u201d been defeated because it was reduced to suicide missions and controlled no territory, Nkeki\u2019s escape raises questions about the location of her fellow kidnapping victims and the thousands of others taken by Boko Haram. \n \n Yakub Bulus, the father of another of the Chibok girls, said that the news brought him joy and hope that his daughter would be found. \n \n \u201cAt least one of them has been found now, hopefully she will reveal where the others are, and with God they will all be found. My hope to see my daughter again has been strengthened,\u201d he said. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption The girl was in a lower year than those abducted from the school \n \n The Nigerian army says it has freed 97 women and girls from Boko Haram, including one of the more than 200 girls abducted from Chibok school. \n \n However, Chibok campaigners say that while the girl in question was a pupil at the school, she was actually kidnapped from her home elsewhere. \n \n This comes days after the first of the Chibok girls was freed. \n \n The Islamist militant group has seized thousands of women and girls in northern Nigeria, rights groups say. \n \n But it was the abduction of the girls from Chibok that gained international attention through the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which was supported by US First Lady Michelle Obama and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai. \n \n The army has made several mistakes in its statements about the Chibok girls - in its initial statement after the first girl was found on Wednesday, it used the wrong name. \n \n It has claimed to have freed more than 100 of them before later backtracking. \n \n In all, 218 girls remain missing since they were seized from Chibok secondary school in Borno state, north-eastern Nigeria, in April 2014. \n \n The girl rescued earlier this week told a Chibok community leader that six of the kidnapped girls had died but the rest were still in the Sambisa forest where she was found. \n \n Behind the headlines: Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa Security Correspondent \n \n It would have been ideal for the Nigerian army to rescue two of the Chibok girls in three days - only it did not happen, despite the speed and enthusiasm with which the press statements were sent out. \n \n The military has been trying to win over the public following heavy criticism it has received for its inability to bring back the schoolgirls. Such has been its focus that it has not capitalised on the work of its troops in rescuing thousands of Boko Haram captives. \n \n In fact, army records show it freed 11,595 people between February and April this year. That has barely been publicised - although the abductions of those people also did not make headlines, unlike the schoolgirls whose disappearance raised concern around the world. \n \n As important as the Chibok girls are, it appears their fate is being used as a measure of success in the fight against Boko Haram. \n \n In a statement, army spokesman Col Sani Usman said the 97 women and girls had been found on Thursday in the Demboa area of Borno, during an operation in which 35 militants were killed. \n \n \"Among those rescued is a girl believed to be one of the Chibok Government Secondary School girls that were abducted on 14 April 2014,\" he said. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Tomi Oladipo: The rescued girl's mother said she was \"thankful to God\" \n \n However, the BringBackOurGirls group said it had established that the rescued girl had been abducted from her home in Madagali, in neighbouring Adamawa state. \n \n Earlier on Thursday, the first Chibok girl found was flown to the capital Abuja to meet President Muhammadu Buhari. \n \n Mr Buhari said he was delighted she was back and vowed to help her resume her education. \n \n \"But my feelings are tinged with deep sadness at the horrors the young girl has had to go through at such an early stage in her life,\" he added. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption The first rescued Chibok girl showed her child to President Buhari \n \n She was found by an army-backed vigilante group in the huge Sambisa Forest, close to the border with Cameroon, along with her four-month-old baby. \n \n She was with a suspected member of Boko Haram who claimed to be her husband. \n \n More on the Chibok abductions: \n \n Chibok rescue revives Twitter campaign \n \n Inside Mbalala, the town that lost its girls \n \n Chibok abductions: What we know \n \n On patrol in the Sambisa forest \n \n Torment of a freed Boko Haram 'bride' \n \n During the April 2014 attack, Boko Haram gunmen arrived in Chibok at night and raided the school dormitories, loading 276 girls on to trucks. \n \n More than 50 managed to escape within hours, mostly by jumping off the lorries and running into roadside bushes, leaving 219 in the hand of Boko Haram. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption The Bring Back Our Girls campaigners and relatives of the girls have marched in Abuja to demand more be done to rescue them \n \n Boko Haram at a glance: \n \n Founded in 2002, initially focused on opposing Western-style education - Boko Haram means \"Western education is forbidden\" in the Hausa language \n \n Launched military operations in 2009 \n \n Thousands killed, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria, and hundreds abducted \n \n Joined so-called Islamic State, now calls itself IS's \"West African province\" \n \n Seized large area in north-east, where it declared caliphate \n \n Regional force has now retaken most of that territory \n \n Who are Boko Haram? ||||| (CNN) A girl rescued by Nigerian troops from Boko Haram militants does not appear to be one of the girls abducted in 2014 from a school in the town of Chibok, as was initially reported, an activist said Friday. \n \n Serah Luka, who was rescued Thursday, did attend the school, but wasn't abducted at the same time as the 276 taken from the school on April 14, 2014, according to Bukky Shonibare of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. \n \n \"However, the same way we rejoice over the return of the Chibok girl, so also is our joy over this one,\" Shonibare said. \n \n A Nigerian army officer said Thursday that Luka was part of the mass abduction. On Friday, Army Brig.

Sani Usman. At least 35 Boko Haram fighters were killed. \n \n Serah Luka was taken to a hospital after her rescue. \n \n Initially Usman said Luka -- the daughter of a pastor -- had started at the boarding school in Chibok a little more than two months before the Boko Haram raid. \n \n Activists and residents of Chibok disputed the claim and asked for more verification, saying Luka's name was not on the list of those missing. \n \n Thursday's news came the same day another kidnap victim, Amina Ali Nkeki, met with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja on Thursday. \n \n She had been found two days before in northeastern Nigeria after apparently escaping from the terror group. \n \n During the emotional meeting, Buhari held the baby Amina gave birth to while a captive of the terror group. \n \n \"Like all Nigerians and many others around the world, I am delighted that Amina Ali is free, but it is tinged with deep sorrow with what she had to go through,\" Buhari said. \n \n Amina was accompanied by her family and Borno State Gov. Kashim Shettima, whose residence she had visited the previous night. \n \n Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari hold Amina Ali's baby. \n \n Shettima had treated Amina, who was limping and severely malnourished when she arrived with her baby at his home, like a \"VIP guest,\" a state government official told CNN. \n \n \"She is receiving high-level medical attention and the best doctors in the state are attending to her. The governor ordered for her release from the military as he wanted to make sure she and her baby daughter received urgent medical and psychological attention,\" he said. \n \n Separated from 'husband' \n \n Amina Ali after escaping the clutches of Boko Haram. \n \n Amina was the first of the so-called Chibok girls to escape since the 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped at gunpoint from their boarding school in northeast Nigeria. \n \n As many as 57 girls were able to escape almost immediately, but more than 200 have remained missing since then. \n \n When Amina escaped, she was accompanied by a young man who said he was her husband and the father of her baby. He said he had been kidnapped by Boko Haram and taken to their forest stronghold, where he married Amina. \n \n But a government official told CNN that Amina had been \"completely detached\" from the man, who remains in military detention and is being interrogated. \n \n Bittersweet reunion \n \n Amina was briefly reunited with her mother on Tuesday night at the family home in Mbalala before being held by the army, CNN learned. \n \n A neighbor who witnessed the emotional meeting told CNN that her mother, Binta Ali, was very distressed when she first saw her daughter. \n \n JUST WATCHED Who are Boko Haram?

The dense forest in Nigeria's northeast is believed to be the terrorist group's stronghold, and has long been the suspected location of the missing girls. \n \n JUST WATCHED Taken girls of Nigeria Replay More Videos ...

Operations to find the missing girls have intensified recently with a deep push into Sambisa Forest, a military spokesman told CNN's Nima Elbagir. \n \n Campaign of terror \n \n The girls' kidnapping sparked global outrage, including the #BringBackOurGirls campaign on social media. \n \n JUST WATCHED Haunted by loss: Chibok parents share their stories Replay More Videos ...

According to a report released in November, the Global Terrorism Index, Boko Haram was the world's deadliest terrorist group in 2014, responsible for 6,644 deaths, compared with ISIS, which was responsible for 6,073. \n \n Besides the spate of kidnappings, the group has also pursued a ruthless campaign of bombing marketplaces throughout Nigeria and neighboring countries.",

Pearson... (Associated Press) \n \n The jury in the trial of Bobby Lee Pearson, 37, mistakenly signed a not-guilty form Wednesday, and the flabbergasted judge said he had no choice but to order him to be released from jail because the verdict had already been put on the record. \n \n It was too late when the judge learned that the jury was unable to reach a verdict, stalling on an 8-4 vote in favor of guilt. Prosecutors might have had an opportunity to retry Pearson, but by then changing the verdict form would have exposed Pearson to double jeopardy. \n \n \"I can't believe it,\" said Superior Court Judge W. Kent Hamlin after setting Pearson free, according to The Fresno Bee. \n \n After being released from jail, Pearson went home to get some clothing and belongings when Fresno police Sgt. James Rios said Pearson apparently got into a fight with his sister's boyfriend. \n \n The two had a long history of problems, said Rios, adding that the boyfriend stabbed and killed Pearson, who was found dead at the scene. The boyfriend's name has not been released. \n \n William Terrence, who prosecuted the case, told The Associated Press that despite the bizarre chain of events that led to Pearson's release, the man he tried sending to prison didn't deserve to die that way. \n \n \"There's not a death penalty on a burglary,\" Terrence said. \"I'm not sitting here thinking he got what he deserved.\" \n \n Terrence said he is still trying to understand the jury's confusion. He said he explained the verdict forms in closing arguments as he has done many times, and so did the judge. \n \n \"Apparently, the message wasn't quite received,\" Terrence said. \n \n In the case of a deadlock, jurors should have sent a note to the judge. \n \n Pearson and two co-defendants were accused of burglarizing an apartment last year and stealing a video system and a gun. The homeowner allegedly caught the intruders and wrestled with one of them. \n \n Jurors returned a guilty verdict against Pearson's co-defendant, Terrel Minnieweather and the mistaken not-guilty verdict against Pearson before lunch Wednesday. \n \n Terrence said Hamlin polled each juror individually to verify Minnieweather's guilty verdict. Turning to Pearson's case, the judge asked the jurors as a group if that was its not-guilty verdict in Pearson's case. \n \n \"No one stood up and said, 'Hey, wait a minute. That's not my verdict,'\" Terrence said. \"They nodded along.\" \n \n Terrence said that it wasn't a mistake to poll the jury as a group. The evidence against Pearson wasn't as strong, and Terrence said he respected the jury's apparent not-guilty decision. \n \n The jurors were then asked to return after lunch for a potential second phase of the trial. The confusion over the verdict came to light during lunch, when one juror told court staff that he had voted to find Pearson guilty. \n \n Jurors said they were confused by the forms, one of which was for a guilty verdict and the other for a not guilty verdict. One juror said there was no form they could sign that indicated the jury was deadlocked. \n \n \"It is bizarre,\" said Eugene Hyman, who retired from the Santa Clara County Superior Court after serving for 20 years on the bench. \"But I can't find fault with anyone.\" \n \n Hyman, who had no involvement in Pearson's case, said during trials, he would always ask each juror whether the verdict read by the clerk was indeed their verdict. He said there's nothing wrong with polling jurors en masse. \n \n Hyman said the Fresno judge had no choice to acquit Pearson if Hamlin ordered the not guilty verdict \"recorded\" immediately after the jurors nodded in agreement with the verdict. \n \n Judges are required to poll jurors after every verdict is read in criminal cases, Hyman said, but that requirement can be waived by lawyers.",

She was not even issued a ticket prior to the arrest, and the only explanation she was offered was a complaint from the Village of Cahokia. \n \n \u201cI understand I violated a code.

Earlier this year, a 70-year-old woman in Prichard, Alabama was also arrested for not mowing lawn, except the citation she received was for a property she no longer owned. A 75-year-old woman in Riesel, Texas was issued a warrant for her arrest after she was accused of not responding to a letter to appear in court for her failing to mow her lawn. \n \n In Pagedale, Missouri, where IJ has filed a class action lawsuit, there has been a similar abuse of municipal code enforcement. In Pagedale residents can be fined for things like chipped paint, mismatched curtains, and walking on the left side of a crosswalk. In 2013, nearly 20 percent of the city\u2019s revenue came from fines and fees, producing a profit-incentive for law enforcement. From 2010 to 2014, the number of non-traffic tickets issued to residents increased by 495 percent. ||||| Clients \n \n The harm to Pagedale residents is significant, perpetual, and often completely overwhelming. \n \n Many find themselves in a never-ending cycle of being fined because they have not kept their homes up to the city\u2019s standards and then are unable to fix their homes to fit the city\u2019s instructions because they are spending so much money paying off their fines. This leads to more fines, which prevents residents from making the changes the city demands, resulting in more fines, and so on. While a resident cannot be arrested for not having the ability to pay a fine, those who cannot pay often do not come to court. They, like those who choose their jobs or child care over attending municipal court, then become the subject of arrest warrants and fines for failure to appear. \n \n The perpetual governmental harassment of innocent Americans for absurd violations has to stop. IJ has therefore teamed up with some Pagedale residents in order to challenge Pagedale\u2019s outrageous ticketing practices. \n \n Plaintiff Vincent Blount has accumulated $2,800 in fines, a significant portion of which comes from tickets regarding the home in which he lives. Paying off his long-term payment plan prevented him from making the improvements the city sought, leading to more fines and ultimately a threat from the city to demolish his home (even though it is not dangerous in any way). Vincent has also spent time in Pagedale jail as a result of his fines and fees and his failure to appear at one of Pagedale\u2019s court sessions. Vincent doesn\u2019t even own the home that is the subject of some of his tickets and fines; it belongs to his long-time partner, Valarie Whitner, who is also a plaintiff in this case. \n \n Valarie has also been the subject of the city\u2019s ticketing practices. She has received a set of warnings from the city, threatening her with fines and fees for alleged violations such as chipped paint on her home or lacking a screen door on the rear entrance to her home. It is unclear what part of the Pagedale Code even regulates chipped paint. Valarie has received generic tickets for \u201chouse not up to code\u201d without further explanation. When Vincent lost his job, he and Valarie fell into arrears and were forced to help pay off the fines by taking out a pay-day loan with a 99% APR. Valarie was even arrested in front of her home and taken to Pagedale city hall because of an unspecified ticket. \n \n Mildred Bryant is 84 years old and living out her golden years in the home she\u2019s owned for 46 years. Mildred is an active woman, exercising three times a week at the local YWCA. Yet despite her active lifestyle, keeping up with Pagedale\u2019s demands is proving to be an impossible task. Mildred received a notice from the city threatening legal action if she did not comply. The notice accused Mildred of at least 12 different code violations. Many of the modifications demanded by the notice are beyond Mildred\u2019s physical and financial abilities. The notice demanded that she touch up or repaint her entire two-story home, including the foundation. Other demands are simply ridiculous, such as demanding that Mildred\u2019s home have matching curtains, slats, or other such window treatment. Her son, whom she raised in Pagedale, occasionally helps her out with complying with the city\u2019s demands. But the grace periods given by the city have elapsed and she faces a real threat of tickets, fines, and imprisonment. \n \n These experiences are far too common in Pagedale. For that reason, these plaintiffs represent a class of Pagedale residents who have been, and will be, ticketed or threatened with tickets by the city since January 1, 2010. These class-action allegations seek to put an end to Pagedale\u2019s unconstitutional treatment of all its residents, as well as the named plaintiffs. ||||| Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal Russia investigation lawyer, is surprisingly frank that his media tour to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is \"all just a big PR campaign,\" Samantha Bee said on Wednesday's Full Frontal. \"Rudy is like a James Bond villain who explains his evil plot to 007 before he actually catches him \u2014 although no Bond villain has ever had teeth quite as grotesque as Rudy Giuliani, chaos demon.\" \n \n In \"his best moments,\" Giuliani \"forgets he's there to lie and whoopsies out some true things,\" Bee said, showing examples. \"But Trump's not keeping Rudy around for his brilliant legal mind, he's keeping him around to spread brilliant propaganda,\" specifically his \"spygate\" conspiracy. \"No matter how many times Trump says it, there is no 'spygate,'\" she explained.

She was not even issued a ticket prior to the arrest, and the only explanation she was offered was a complaint from the village, per the International Business Times.

Mr. Lewis noted that, according to American intelligence agencies, Russia hacked Democratic targets during the presidential campaign and gave thousands of emails to WikiLeaks for publication. \n \n \u201cI think a foreign power is much more likely the source of these documents than a conscience-stricken C.I.A. whistle-blower,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \n \n At a time of increasing concern about the privacy of calls and messages, the revelations did not suggest that the C.I.A. can actually break the encryption used by popular messaging apps. Instead, by penetrating the user\u2019s phone, the agency can make the encryption irrelevant by intercepting messages and calls before their content is encrypted, or, on the other end, after messages are decrypted. \n \n WikiLeaks, which has sometimes been accused of recklessly leaking information that could do harm, said it had redacted names and other identifying information from the collection. It said it was not releasing the computer code for actual, usable weapons \u201cuntil a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.\u2019s program and how such \u2018weapons\u2019 should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\u201d \n \n The codes names used for projects revealed in the WikiLeaks documents appear to reflect the likely demographic of the cyberexperts employed by the C.I.A. \u2014 that is, young and male. There are numerous references to \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d Pok\u00e9mon and Adderall, the drug used to treat hyperactivity. \n \n A number of projects were named after whiskey brands. Some were high-end single malt scotches, such as Laphroaig and Ardbeg.

A animal of the avian variety that has not been domesticated. Also a type of alcohol with a high proof (151).\u201d ||||| WikiLeaks says it has a trove on the CIA's hacking secrets. Washington Post national security reporter Greg Miller explains what these documents reveal. (Dalton Bennett,Greg Miller/The Washington Post) \n \n The latest revelations about the U.S. government\u2019s powerful hacking tools potentially takes surveillance right into the homes and hip pockets of billions of users worldwide, showing how a remarkable variety of everyday devices can be turned to spy on their owners. \n \n Televisions, smartphones and even anti-virus software are all vulnerable to CIA hacking, according to the WikiLeaks documents released Tuesday. The capabilities described include recording the sounds, images and the private text messages of users, even when they resort to encrypted apps to communicate. \n \n [WikiLeaks says it has obtained trove of CIA hacking tools] \n \n While many of the attack technologies had been previously discussed at cybersecurity conferences, experts were startled to see evidence that the CIA had turned so many theoretical vulnerabilities into functioning attack tools against staples of modern life. These include widely used Internet routers, smartphones, and Mac and Windows computers. \n \n In the case of a tool called \u201cWeeping Angel\u201d for attacking Samsung SmartTVs, WikiLeaks wrote, \u201cAfter infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a \u2018Fake-Off\u2019 mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on, In \u2018Fake-Off\u2019 mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.\u201d \n \n The CIA reportedly also has studied whether it could infect vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks alleged could be used to conduct \u201cnearly undetectable assassinations.\u201d \n \n And a specialized CIA unit called the Mobile Devices Branch produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, which according to WikiLeaks were a particular focus because of the smartphone\u2019s popularity \u201camong social, political diplomatic and business elites.\u201d The agency also targeted popular phones running Google\u2019s Android, the world\u2019s leading mobile operating system. \n \n Wikileaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. The anti-secrecy group also said that by developing such intrusive technology \u2014 rather than helping tech companies patch flaws in their products \u2014 the CIA was undermining efforts to protect the cybersecurity of Americans. \n \n \u201cThe argument that there is some terrorist using a Samsung TV somewhere \u2014 as a reason to not disclose that vulnerability to the company, when it puts thousands of Americans at risk \u2014 I fundamentally disagree with it, \u201c said Alex Rice, chief technology officer for Hacker One, a start-up that enlists hackers to report security gaps to companies and organizations in exchange for cash. \n \n [The Trump White House is totally changing its tune on wiretapping and hoping you don\u2019t notice] \n \n The trove released Tuesday , which The Washington Post could not independently verify and the CIA has declined to confirm, included 8,761 documents that were the first batch of a series of releases that WikiLeaks plans, it said. \n \n This first group, at least, shows important differences from the 2013 revelations by the National Security Agency\u2019s former contractor Edward Snowden. His trove of documents largely described mass surveillance of Internet-based communications systems, while the WikiLeaks release more often describes attacks on individual devices. \n \n By targeting devices, the CIA reportedly gains access to even well-encrypted communications, on such popular apps as Signal and WhatsApp, without having to crack the encryption itself. The WikiLeaks reports acknowledged that difference by saying the CIA had found ways to \u201cbypass,\u201d as opposed to defeat, encryption technologies. \n \n \u201cThe idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news,\u201d said Johns Hopkins cryptography expert Matthew D. Green. \u201cAnyone who thought they couldn\u2019t was living in a fantasy world.\u201d \n \n Snowden\u2019s revelations and the backlash made strong encryption a major, well-funded cause for both privacy advocates and, perhaps more importantly, technology companies that had the engineering expertise and budgets to protect data as it flowed across the world. \n \n Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and many other companies announced major new initiatives, in part to protect their brands against accusations by some users that they had made it too easy for the NSA to collect information from their systems. Many websites, meanwhile, began encrypting their data flows to users to prevent snooping. Encryption tools such as Tor were strengthened. \n \n Encrypting apps for private messaging, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp exploded in popularity, especially among users around the world who were fearful of government intrusion. In the days following the U.S. presidential election, Signal was among the most downloaded in Apple\u2019s app store, and downloads grew by more than 300 percent. \n \n Open Whispers Systems, which developed Signal, released a statement Tuesday, saying, \u201cThe CIA/WikiLeaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption.\u201d \n \n WhatsApp declined to comment, and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment, while Samsung did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n \u201cWhile our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates,\u201d Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement Tuesday. \n \n [Understanding cyberspace is key to defending against digital attacks] \n \n U.S. government authorities complained loudly that the post-Snowden wave of encryption was undermining their ability to investigate serious crimes, such as terrorism and child pornography. The FBI in 2016 sued Apple in hopes of forcing it to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernadino killers before announcing it had other ways to crack the device amid heavy public criticism. \n \n Against that backdrop, many privacy advocates argued that devices \u2014 often called \u201cendpoints\u201d for their place on chains of communications that can crisscross continents \u2014 were the best available targets left in a world with widespread online encryption. The WikiLeaks documents suggests that the CIA may have reached the same conclusion. \n \n \u201cIt would certainly be consistent with the hypothesis that we\u2019ve made real progress in the encryption we\u2019ve been introducing,\u201d said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be 100 percent certain, but reading the tea leaves, it\u2019s plausible.\u201d \n \n The WikiLeaks revelations also will serve as a reminder that, for whatever the political backlash to revelations about digital spying, it is not going away and probably will continue to grow. \n \n Aside from the United States, many other advanced nations such as China, Russia, Britain and Israel have extremely sophisticated tools for digital spying. Less advanced nations have gained access to powerful online spying technology through a robust and lightly regulated industry of surveillance contractors based throughout the world. \n \n On Tuesday, resignation and frustration rippled through Silicon Valley as technologists grappled with revelations of yet another U.S. government attempt to exploit their systems. And cybersecurity experts reacted with alarm. \n \n \u201cThis is explosive,\u201d said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition Infosec, a cybersecurity firm. The material highlights specific anti-virus products that can be defeated, going further than a release of NSA hacking tools last year, he said. \n \n The WikiLeaks release revealed that the CIA has sophisticated \u201cstealth\u201d capabilities that enable hackers not only to infiltrate systems, but evade detection, as well as abilities to move inside a system freely as if they owned it. \n \n Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley said the dates in the WikiLeaks files suggest the documents were taken in February or March 2016. At least two of them are marked Top Secret, \u201cwhich suggests that somebody in early 2016 managed to compromise a Top Secret CIA development system and is willing to say that they did.\u201d \n \n One internal CIA document listed a set of Apple iPhone \u201cexploits\u201d \u2014 or tools that can be used to compromise the device by taking advantage of software flaws. Some of the tools are based on \u201czero-days,\u201d which are software vulnerabilities that have not been shared with the manufacturer. So \u201csome of these descriptions will allow Apple to fix the vulnerabilities,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut at the same time, they\u2019re out in the public and whoever stole this data could use them against U.S. interests.\u201d \n \n Read more: \n \n How the CIA deceives its own workforce about operations \n \n NSA contractor charged with stealing top secret data \n \n How hard is it to get an intelligence wiretap? Pretty hard. \n \n This pretty blond doll could be spying on your family ||||| A vast portion of the CIA\u2019s computer hacking arsenal appeared to have been exposed Tuesday by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which posted thousands of files revealing secret cyber-tools used by the agency to convert cellphones, televisions and other ordinary devices into implements of espionage. \n \n The trove appeared to lay bare the design and capabilities of some of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s most closely guarded cyberweapons, a breach that is likely to cause immediate damage to the CIA\u2019s efforts to gather intelligence overseas and place new strain on the U.S. government\u2019s relationship with Silicon Valley giants including Apple and Google. \n \n WikiLeaks, which claimed to have gotten the files from a current or former CIA contractor, touted the trove as comparable in scale and significance to the collection of National Security Agency documents exposed by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. \n \n But while the Snowden files revealed massive surveillance programs that gathered data on millions of Americans, the CIA documents posted so far by WikiLeaks appear mainly to unmask hacking methods that many experts already assumed the agency had developed. \n \n U.S. intelligence officials and experts said details contained in the newly released documents suggest that they are legitimate, although that could not be independently verified, raising new worries about the U.S. government\u2019s ability to safeguard its secrets in an era of cascading leaks of classified data. \n \n (Reuters) \n \n The files mention pieces of malware with names like \u201cAssassin\u201d and \u201cMedusa\u201d that seem drawn from a spy film, describing tools that the CIA uses to steal data from iPhones, seize control of Microsoft-powered computers or even make Internet-connected Samsung television sets secretly function as microphones. \n \n The release of so many sensitive files appeared to catch the CIA, the White House and other government entities off-guard. A CIA spokesman would say only that \u201cwe do not comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents.\u201d \n \n In a statement, WikiLeaks indicated that the initial stockpile it put online was part of a broader collection of nearly 9,000 files that would be posted over time describing code developed in secret by the CIA to steal data from a range of targets. WikiLeaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. \n \n The release was described as a huge loss to the CIA by security experts and former U.S. intelligence officials. \u201cIt looks like really the backbone of their network exploitation kit,\u201d said a former hacker who worked for the National Security Agency and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. \n \n The breach could undermine the CIA\u2019s ability to carry out key parts of its mission, from targeting the Islamic State and other terrorist networks to penetrating the computer defenses of sophisticated cyber-adversaries including Russia, China and Iran, former officials and tech specialists said. \n \n \u201cAny exposure of these tools is going to cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission,\u201d a former senior U.S. intelligence official said. \n \n If legitimate, the release represents the latest major breach of sensitive U.S. government data to be put on global display in humiliating fashion by WikiLeaks, which came to prominence in 2010 with the exposure of thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables and military files. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has engaged in an escalating feud with the United States while taking refuge at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London from Swedish sexual assault allegations. \n \n WikiLeaks\u2019 latest assault on U.S. secrets may pose an early, potentially awkward security issue for President Trump, who has repeatedly praised WikiLeaks and disparaged the CIA. \n \n Trump declared \u201cI love WikiLeaks\u201d last October during a campaign rally when he read from a trove of stolen emails about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, that had been posted to the organization's website. \n \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment when asked about the CIA breach during a news briefing Tuesday. \n \n [Why the CIA is using your TVs, smartphones and cars for spying] \n \n WikiLeaks indicated that it obtained the files from a current or former CIA contractor, saying that \u201cthe archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\u201d \n \n But the counterintelligence investigation underway at the CIA is also likely to search for clues to whether Russia had any role in the theft of the agency\u2019s digital arsenal. U.S. intelligence officials allege that WikiLeaks has ties to Russian intelligence services. The website posted thousands of emails stolen from Democratic Party computer networks during the 2016 presidential campaign, files that U.S. intelligence agencies concluded were obtained and turned over to WikiLeaks as part of a cyber-campaign orchestrated by the Kremlin. \n \n Experts and former intelligence officials said the latest files appear to be authentic in part because they refer to code names and capabilities known to have been developed by the CIA\u2019s cyber-branch. \n \n \u201cAt first glance,\u201d the data release \u201cis probably legitimate or contains a lot of legitimate stuff, which means somebody managed to extract a lot of data from a classified CIA system and is willing to let the world know that,\u201d said Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley. \n \n Faking a large quantity of data is difficult but not impossible, he noted. Weaver said he knows of one case of WikiLeaks deliberately neglecting to include a document in a data release and one case of WikiLeaks deliberately mislabeling stolen data, \u201cbut no cases yet of deliberately fraudulent information.\u201d \n \n [WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations] \n \n WikiLeaks said the trove comprised tools \u2014 including malware, viruses, trojans and weaponized \u201czero day\u201d exploits \u2014 developed by a CIA entity known as the Engineering Development Group, part of a sprawling cyber-directorate created in recent years as the agency shifted resources and attention to online espionage. \n \n WikiLeaks labeled the trove \u201cVault 7\u201d and said that it contains several hundred million lines of code, many of which are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in everyday consumer devices. \n \n In a statement, WikiLeaks said the files enable the agency to bypass popular encryption-enabled applications \u2014 including WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram \u2014 used by millions of people to safeguard their communications. \n \n But experts said that rather than defeating the encryption of those applications, the CIA\u2019s methods rely on exploiting vulnerabilities in the devices on which they are installed, a method referred to as \u201chacking the endpoint.\u201d \n \n [Why understanding cyberspace is key to defending against digital attacks] \n \n WikiLeaks said that the files were created between 2013 and 2016 and that it would publish only a portion of the archive \u2014 redacting some sensitive samples of code \u2014 \u201cuntil a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA\u2019s program.\u201d \n \n The organization did not clarify what achieving such a consensus would entail, but for now it appeared to be withholding fully formed pieces of ready-made code that could be used by other intelligence services or even novice hackers. \n \n Still, the data release alarmed cybersecurity experts, who said the files contain snippets of code that could enable adversaries to replicate CIA capabilities or identify and root out CIA \u201cimplants\u201d currently in place. \n \n \u201cThis is explosive,\u201d said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity firm. The material highlights specific anti-virus products that can be defeated, going further than a release of NSA hacking tools last year, he said. The CIA hackers, according to WikiLeaks, even \u201cdiscussed what the NSA\u2019s . . . hackers did wrong and how the CIA\u2019s malware makers could avoid similar exposure.\u201d \n \n Hackers who worked at the NSA\u2019s Tailored Access Operations unit said the CIA\u2019s library of tools looked comparable. The implants \u2014 software that enables hackers to remotely control a compromised device \u2014 are \u201cvery, very complex\u201d and \u201cat least on par with the NSA,\u201d said one former TAO hacker. \n \n Beyond hacking weapons, the files also purportedly reveal information about the organization of the CIA\u2019s cyber-directorate and indicate that the agency uses the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as a hacking hub for operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n \n Though primarily thought of as an agency that recruits spies, the CIA has taken on a larger role in electronic espionage over the past decade. In 2015 the agency created the Directorate of Digital Innovation, a division that puts cyber-work on equal footing with long-standing directorates devoted to conventional spying and analysis. \n \n The CIA\u2019s focus is more narrow and targeted than that of the NSA, which is responsible for sweeping up electronic communications on a large scale around the globe. By contrast, CIA efforts mainly focus on \u201cclose in\u201d operations in which the agency at times relies on individuals carrying thumb drives or other devices to implant code on computer systems not connected to the Internet. \n \n One of the most intriguing tools described in the files, called \u201cWeeping Angel,\u201d can apparently be used to put certain television sets into a fake \u201coff\u201d mode while activating a microphone that enables the CIA to capture any conversations in the surrounding space. \n \n Ashkan Soltani and Julie Tate contributed to this report. \n \n Read more: \n \n How the CIA deceives its own workforce about operations \n \n NSA contractor charged with stealing top secret data \n \n How hard is it to get an intelligence wiretap?

Internal CIA files are rarely seen, and WikiLeaks has used them to claim that the agency has \"lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal.\" But some of the claims that WikiLeaks presented along with the documents have been criticized by security researchers as being exaggerated or overblown. WikiLeaks has claimed that secure messaging apps have been broken and that the CIA can hack into iPhones, which have widely been seen as a more secure choice than Android phones. Although the documents themselves are a rare and fascinating possible look into the CIA, there isn't much in there that should worry people for now, security researchers and professionals told Business Insider. Here's what you need to know as an iPhone or iPad user about the WikiLeaks \"Vault 7\" dump. View As: One Page Slides \n \n False: The CIA was able to break into Signal and WhatsApp Apps like Signal and WhatsApp are commonly cited as secure messaging apps, meaning the government, companies, or hackers can't intercept messages in transit and read them. That's what security professionals call \"end-to-end encryption.\" If the CIA were able to break into Signal, as several outlets and commentators have claimed, that would be a big deal. Even WikiLeaks is phrasing its claims to make it sound as if this is the case. The good news is that there is no evidence in the WikiLeaks dump that suggests the math that keeps messages secure \u2014 called \"crypto\" \u2014 that's behind either WhatsApp or Signal has been broken, as suggested by WikiLeaks. Instead, the claim is more fundamental. If the CIA were able to hack into an end user's iPhone or Android device, then Signal's crypto wouldn't matter. The CIA would be able to read what users are seeing and sending before it was encrypted by the software. If your computer or operating system, such as iOS, is already compromised, it doesn't matter how secure your messaging system is. Basically, the CIA \"has some expensive, targeted ways to hack phones, and if your phone is hacked, well, your apps won't save you,\" Zeynep Tufekci, a New York Times contributor and associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science, told Business Insider. \"If someone is specifically targeted and their phone is running an older version and thus vulnerable to exploitation, no 'secure' apps can protect you because the OS itself is compromised,\" Will Strafach, the CEO of Sudo Security Group and a security professional with extensive experience in iOS exploits, told Business Insider. Signal's underlying technology remains secure, it says. \"End-to-end encryption has pushed intelligence agencies away from undetected and unfettered mass surveillance to where they have to use high-risk and targeted attacks,\" Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal, told New York magazine. Strafach said, \"WikiLeaks has an interest in getting big hype for their leaks, obviously, so it blurs what is and is not a concern.\" ||||| Thanks to WikiLeaks, antivirus vendors will soon be able to figure out if you have been hacked by the CIA. \n \n On Tuesday, WikiLeaks dumped a trove of 8,700 documents that allegedly detail the CIA\u2019s secret hacking operations, including spying tools designed for mobile phones, PCs and smart TVs. \n \n WikiLeaks has redacted the actual source code from the files to prevent the distribution of cyber weapons, it said. Nevertheless, the document dump\u2014if real\u2014still exposes some of the techniques that the CIA has allegedly been using. \n \n Among those techniques are ways to bypass antivirus software from vendors including Avira, Bitdefender and Comodo, according to some of the leaked documents. \n \n The CIA\u2019s playbook out in the open \n \n The documents even include some snippets of code that antivirus vendors can use to detect whether a hacking attempt may have come from the CIA, said Jake Williams, founder of security company Rendition InfoSec. \n \n \u201cIn the documents, they (the CIA) mention specific code snippets used in operational tools,\u201d Williams said. Antivirus vendors can use this to look at their customers\u2019 networks for any traces of past intrusions. \n \n That might be a big blow to the CIA\u2019s surveillance operations. Now anyone, including foreign governments, can use the WikiLeaks dump to figure out if the CIA ever targeted them, according to Williams. \n \n \u201cI would bet my bank account that the hackers of the CIA have spent all day trying to remove their tools from high value networks,\u201d he said. \n \n WikiLeaks hasn\u2019t said who supplied the secret documents. But the anonymous source is hoping to spark debate over whether the CIA abused its authority by developing so many hacking tools without public oversight, WikiLeaks said. \n \n \u201cThere is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber \u2018weapons\u2019,\u201d WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange added in a statement. \n \n But some security researchers believe WikiLeaks is trying to mislead the public by exaggerating the CIA\u2019s hacking capabilities. \u201cThe press is getting taken for a ride today,\u201d said Will Strafach, CEO of Sudo Security Group who studies vulnerabilities in Apple\u2019s iOS. \n \n How real are the risks? \n \n Although WikiLeaks has said the CIA documents show the agency can hack iPhones and Android smartphones for spying purposes, consumers shouldn\u2019t necessarily be concerned, he said. \n \n That\u2019s because the dumped documents mostly mention exploits for iOS that appear to already be publicly known and have been patched. \n \n \u201cI have not found anything here that could be a danger to anyone running iOS 10 or above,\u201d Strafach said. \n \n Earlier news headlines and a tweet from WikiLeaks on Tuesday also suggested that the CIA hacking tools can bypass the encryption on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But there\u2019s no evidence that the CIA ever cracked the encryption, only that the agency developed exploits and malware to take over devices. \n \n \u201cThe CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption,\u201d tweeted Open Whisper Systems, which developed the encryption used in the apps. \n \n Journalists and security researchers are still looking over the dumped documents. But it doesn\u2019t appear the hacking tools equate to mass surveillance, said Robert Graham, CEO of security firm Errata Security. \n \n One hacking tool, code-named Weeping Angel, allegedly involves turning a Samsung smart TV into a monitoring device. But the tool seems to only work if a CIA agent can physically install it on the TV. \n \n \u201cWhen we look at the tools, they really give off the impression that they are used locally,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThat some CIA agent has to walk in. It\u2019s not remote hacking.\u201d \n \n Questions over vulnerabilities \n \n Still, some privacy advocates are worried by the WikiLeaks document dump. They say it confirms that the U.S. government has known about key vulnerabilities in tech products, but decides to develop hacking tools around them, rather than help vendors patch them. \n \n A document in the dump shows that CIA exploits for Apple\u2019s iOS were allegedly purchased from the U.S. National Security Agency, British intelligence or bought from third-party providers. \n \n The key danger is that malicious groups, such as foreign government hackers, might discover the vulnerabilities too\u2014putting everyday users in harm\u2019s way. \n \n \u201cAs these leaks show, we\u2019re all made less safe by the CIA\u2019s decision to keep\u2014rather than ensure the patching of\u2014vulnerabilities,\u201d wrote Cindy Cohn, executive director of privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \n \n \u201cEven spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans,\u201d she said. \n \n But others aren\u2019t so sure the document dump really shows that the CIA has been stockpiling information about vulnerabilities. \n \n \u201cIt is difficult to tell this from the info we have at this point,\u201d Ari Schwartz, a former White House senior director for cybersecurity, said in an email. \u201cQuestions that I would have are: Are they really previously unknown?\u201d ||||| Press Release \n \n Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named \"Vault 7\" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. \n \n The first full part of the series, \"Year Zero\", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. \n \n Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized \"zero day\" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. \n \n \"Year Zero\" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of \"zero day\" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. \n \n Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force \u2014 its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities. \n \n By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other \"weaponized\" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its \"own NSA\" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. \n \n In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. \n \n Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. \n \n Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that \"There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of \"Year Zero\" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.\" \n \n Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the \"Year Zero\" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published. \n \n Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in \"Year Zero\" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in \"Vault 7\" part one (\u201cYear Zero\u201d) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. \n \n Analysis \n \n CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs \n \n CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details). \n \n The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide. \n \n The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but \"Weeping Angel\", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. \n \n The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. \n \n As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. \n \n The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. \n \n Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote \"zero days\" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. \n \n A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. \"Year Zero\" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 \"weaponized\" Android \"zero days\" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors. \n \n These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the \"smart\" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. \n \n CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers \n \n The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized \"zero days\", air gap jumping viruses such as \"Hammer Drill\" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ( \"Brutal Kangaroo\") and to keep its malware infestations going. \n \n Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as \"Assassin\" and \"Medusa\". \n \n Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB). \n \n The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's \"HIVE\" and the related \"Cutthroat\" and \"Swindle\" tools, which are described in the examples section below. \n \n CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities (\"zero days\") \n \n In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis \u2014 rather than hoard \u2014 serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or \"zero days\" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers. \n \n Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others. \n \n The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. \n \n \"Year Zero\" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. \n \n As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in \"Year Zero\" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities (\"zero days\") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. \n \n The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. \n \n 'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk \n \n Cyber 'weapons' are not possible to keep under effective control. \n \n While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain. \n \n Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. \n \n Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces \u2014 sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global \"vulnerability market\" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'. Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling 'hacking' services. \n \n Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booz Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers. \n \n A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents. \n \n Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools. \n \n Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. \n \n U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base \n \n In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n \n CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( \"Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe\" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (\"black\") passports and State Department cover. The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: \"Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport\" \n \n Your Cover Story (for this trip) \n \n Q: Why are you here? \n \n A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate. \n \n Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures. \n \n Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area \u2014 including France, Italy and Switzerland. \n \n A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked. \n \n How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks \n \n In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of \"Vault 7\" \u2014 the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems \u2014 the agency has little legal recourse. \n \n The CIA made these systems unclassified. \n \n Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'. \n \n To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely \"pirate\" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets. \n \n Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator's intent. \n \n Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted \"malware injections\" (commercial jargon) or \"implant drops\" (NSA jargon) are being called \"fires\" as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable. \n \n Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its 'target'. CIA malware does not \"explode on impact\" but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command & Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified. \n \n A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation. \n \n Evading forensics and anti-virus \n \n A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. \n \n CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's \"Recycle Bin\". While Comodo 6.x has a \"Gaping Hole of DOOM\". \n \n CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's \"Equation Group\" hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure. \n \n Examples \n \n The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by \"Year Zero\") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools. \n \n The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation (\"implanting\"), control, and exfiltration. \n \n Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs. \n \n Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' \"Year Zero\". \n \n UMBRAGE \n \n The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a \"fingerprint\" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity. \n \n This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution. \n \n The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. \n \n With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \"fingerprints\" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. \n \n UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques. \n \n Fine Dining \n \n Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically \"exfiltrating\" information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff. \n \n Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'. Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The 'Case Officer' is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The 'menu' also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. \n \n Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE) \n \n 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies. \n \n HIVE \n \n HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants. \n \n The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains. \n \n Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website. \n \n The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant. \n \n Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project. \n \n See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE. \n \n Frequently Asked Questions \n \n Why now? \n \n WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready. \n \n In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a \"Cyberwar\" review to be prepared within 30 days. \n \n While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date. \n \n Redactions \n \n Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete. \n \n Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency. Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers) to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person. Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all the file names in the archive. As the archive content is assessed it may be made available; until then the archive is redacted. Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been infected with weaponized CIA malware. As the content is assessed it may be made available; until then the content is redacted. The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, are redacted for further exclusive investigation. Binary files of non-public origin are only available as dumps to prevent accidental invocation of CIA malware infected binaries. \n \n Organizational Chart \n \n The organizational chart corresponds to the material published by WikiLeaks so far. \n \n Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently. \n \n Wiki pages \n \n \"Year Zero\" contains 7818 web pages with 943 attachments from the internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page histories for 1136 latest versions. \n \n The order of named pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the re-constructed page). \n \n What time period is covered? \n \n The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). \n \n WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks. \n \n What is \"Vault 7\" \n \n \"Vault 7\" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. \n \n When was each part of \"Vault 7\" obtained? \n \n Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. \n \n Is each part of \"Vault 7\" from a different source? \n \n Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. \n \n What is the total size of \"Vault 7\"? \n \n The series is the largest intelligence publication in history. \n \n How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of \"Vault 7\"? \n \n Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them. \n \n Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series? \n \n No. That would be certainly counter-productive. \n \n Has WikiLeaks already 'mined' all the best stories? \n \n No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series. They're there. Look. Those who demonstrate journalistic excellence may be considered for early access to future parts. \n \n Won't other journalists find all the best stories before me? \n \n Unlikely. There are very considerably more stories than there are journalists or academics who are in a position to write them. ||||| A data dump from WikiLeaks says the CIA can spy on you through your internet-connected Samsung television, which means government spies could know a lot more about you than whether you love Girls. \n \n Earlier today, WikiLeaks released a trove of documents describing what it calls secret spying and hacking tools developed by the CIA and British intelligence. They include a Fake Off mode inserted into Samsung televisions. If activated, it makes the television appear to be off but keeps the power running so spies can capture audio and possibly video of anything in the room. Samsung has not yet responded to our request for comment. \n \n It must be noted that the hack, codenamed Weeping Angel (a Doctor Who reference, by the way) applies only to Samsung televisions from 2012 and 2013 that feature outdated firmware versions 1111, 1112, and 1116. The exploit almost certainly impacts relatively few people, and there may be an easy way to tell if you've been hacked\u2014Fake Off mode, as outlined in the 2014 document, leaves a blue LED on the back of the set illuminated. \n \n Now, the CIA probably created this hack to target specific individuals, and it appears the hack can be loaded onto a television only via a USB firmware update that was recently disabled. So unless you're a known operative, it's unlikely the government compromised your TV. But we're sure you're still curious, so here's how to tell if it's happening: \n \n The Telltale LED \n \n In Fake Off mode, the screen appears off and the LEDs on the front of the set change color and dim, as you'd expect if you'd turned off your TV. Yet the TV remains powered and capable of recording conversations. Want to know if Big Brother is listening in? Look at the back of your set. The blue LED back there should be off. It remains illuminated in Fake Off mode, according to the documents WikiLeaks released. \n \n Which TVs? \n \n If you've got a Samsung from 2012 or 2013, check to see if you've got one of these models: From 2012: UNES8000F, E8000GF plasma, and UNES7550F. From 2013: UNF8000 series, F8500 plasma, UNF7500 series, and UNF7000 series. To determine your firmware version and to update it, go to the main menu, select Support, then select Software Update. \n \n It is possible the CIA has updated Fake Off mode to address the telltale LED, and it's possible Samsung changed the LED on subsequent models. But the company acknowledged in 2015 that hackers could compromise the voice-control feature in some sets, and it took steps at the time to patch the problem. \n \n Be Seeing You \n \n The companies making internet-connected smart televisions have drawn criticism for collecting and sharing user data. If you want effective protection from unscrupulous companies, shifty hackers, and government spies, simply disconnect your TV from the internet. But if you remain worried, there's only one sure-fire method for preventing that: unplug the TV.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's being called the CIA's \"Snowden moment\"\u2014and it reveals secrets that paranoid time-travelers from the 1950s would find completely unsurprising, including suggestions that the agency has been spying on people through their TVs. The CIA is scrambling to deal with the fallout from WikiLeaks' release Tuesday of a vast trove of data on the agency's hacking tools. A former senior intelligence official tells the Washington Post that the leak, which experts believe is genuine, could \"cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission.\" A roundup of coverage: One hack, code-named Weeping Angel, allows spies to capture audio and possibly video from Samsung smart TVs that appear to be turned off. Wired has a guide to telling whether your TV has been hacked. PC World reports that the WikiLeaks release included snippets of code that antivirus vendors can now use to determine whether hacking attempts originated at the CIA. MIT Technology Review describes the leaked information, including news that the CIA has found vulnerabilities in iOS and Android, as \"sinister\" but not \"particularly Earth-shattering\" from a technological point of view. Business Insider examines some of WikiLeaks' claims and finds that there's no evidence that the CIA was able to crack the encryption of apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, tells the New York Times he's disturbed by signs that the government knew about vulnerabilities in electronic devices and kept them quiet to make spying easier. \"Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,\" Wizner says. \"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\" Forbes spoke to security experts from several companies about the leak. They said the information about the CIA's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \"People need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions,\" says Ajay Arora, CEO of Vera. \"At the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you\u2014people can't even trust their own government anymore. This is the tragic new normal we have to all unfortunately accept.\" Companies including Google, Samsung, and WhatsApp declined to comment, the Washington Post reports. Apple released a statement saying the issues disclosed in the leak were patched in a recent update and that they \"always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security update.\" \"Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV. That's today,\" tweeted Edward Snowden, though he added that while it may not feel like it, end-to-end encryption has actually made computer security a lot better than it used to be.",

That's a big difference from last year, when only a handful of customers managed to enroll on the first day. There were reports Saturday that returning customers had problems, but some of that may have been confusion trying to remember user names and passwords. Administration spokesman Aaron Albright said today he had not seen any indication of problems. \u2013 The second open enrollment period for ObamaCare is under way, and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell says 100,000 people applied for coverage in the first eight hours, reports Politico. That's a big improvement over the first open enrollment, when the website went down for a day and a half because of technical problems. Burwell also said that half a million people were able to log on to HealthCare.gov.",

Just WALKED off plane in Indy to play in The #SuperBowl. #TakeThat**** Cancer.\u201d \n \n \u201cI was very pleased and very happy that so many people got to see it because that\u2019s part of what my goal is and what my mission is,\u201d Herzlich said Tuesday at Media Day. \u201cThis week\u2019s all about football and all about playing, but there are people that are out there going through cancer right now and saying, \u2018He\u2019s doing it.

I\u2019ve come from a different, tough place in my life with being sick, and just two short years later, to be able to play in the Super Bowl, that\u2019s great.\u201d \n \n According to Herzlich, football was the second-biggest motivator, only behind his family, in his battle with cancer. He even made a highlight tape of himself from Boston College\u2019s 2008 season to help him \u201cthrough the bad days\u201d of chemotherapy. \n \n Since he was a Boston College student at the time of his diagnosis, Herzlich received a lot of support in New England. Although most of those fans will pull for the Patriots on Sunday, a few likely will cheer for Herzlich, too. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to have Boston fans root for any sort of Giant, but I appreciate everything, and the support I got all through school was unbelievable,\u201d Herzlich said. \u201cEven today, I got tweets from people saying, \u2018I am a Patriots fan.

He was thankful not just to be there, but to be alive. \n \n \"2 yrs ago I was told I might never walk again. Just WALKED off plane in Indy to play in The #SuperBowl. #TakeThatSh*tCancer,\" he tweeted. \n \n In 2009, Herzlich was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. The cancer was isolated to his left leg and the initial prognosis was not positive for the promising Boston College football star. \n \n \"They felt the NFL was a long shot,\" Herzlich's father, Sandy, told ESPN last summer. \"They were first happy if they could save his life and they were happy if they could save his leg.\" \n \n Herzlich was told there were three possible outcomes. \n \n \"The worst-case scenario is obviously [that] it gets into other parts of your body and it completely kills you,\" he told ESPN. \"Second worst-case scenario is if they saw a small fracture in the bone and it was seeping out. Then they would have to amputate my leg right away within hours of finding it out. \u2026 Then better than that would be to remove that portion of the leg, putting in a cadaver bone and being in a cast for six months from the waist down, not ever being able to run again.\" \n \n It turns out there was a fourth and even better option. \n \n Herzlich responded phenomenally to aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. He was given the choice to forgo surgery and continue treatment, saving his football career, but increasing the likelihood that the cancer could return, or have surgery, ending his football aspirations, but likely eliminating the cancer. \n \n Herzlich decided to keep his dream alive. \n \n After missing the 2009 college football season to undergo treatment, he took the field for Boston College in 2010. He started in all 13 games, but did not catch the eye of NFL scouts and went undrafted. \n \n Herzlich continued training and eventually signed as a free agent with the New York Giants. \n \n Now, one year into his NFL career he's walked off the plane in Indianapolis and is getting ready to run onto the field at Lucas Oil Stadium, two things, that just three years ago seemed nearly impossible. \n \n ESPN contributed to this report.",

    "document": "This Administration has consistently taken steps to make our criminal justice system fairer and more effective and to address the vicious cycle of poverty, criminality, and incarceration that traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. Today, in Newark, New Jersey, President Obama will continue to promote these goals by highlighting the reentry process of formerly-incarcerated individuals and announce new actions aimed at helping Americans who\u2019ve paid their debt to society rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities. \n \n Each year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from state and federal prisons. Advancing policies and programs that enable these men and women to put their lives back on track and earn their second chance promotes not only justice and fairness, but also public safety. That is why this Administration has taken a series of concrete actions to reduce the challenges and barriers that the formerly incarcerated confront, including through the work of the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, a cabinet-level working group to support the federal government's efforts to promote public safety and economic opportunity through purposeful cross-agency coordination and collaboration. \n \n The President has also called on Congress to pass meaningful criminal justice reform, including reforms that reduce recidivism for those who have been in prison and are reentering society. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, which recently received a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, would be an important step forward in this effort, by providing new incentives and opportunities for those incarcerated to participate in the type of evidence-based treatment and training and other programs proven to reduce recidivism, promote successful reentry, and help eliminate barriers to economic opportunity following release. By reducing overlong sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, the bill would also free up additional resources for investments in other public safety initiatives, including reentry services, programs for mental illness and addiction, and state and local law enforcement. \n \n Today, the President is pleased to announce the following measures to help promote rehabilitation and reintegration: \n \n Adult Reentry Education Grants . The Department of Education will award up to $8 million (over 3 years) to 9 communities for the purpose of supporting educational attainment and reentry success for individuals who have been incarcerated. This grant program seeks to build evidence on effective reentry education programs and demonstrate that high-quality, appropriately designed, integrated, and well-implemented educational and related services in institutional and community settings are critical in supporting educational attainment and reentry success. \n \n .

Arrests Guidance for Public and other HUD-Assisted Housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will release guidance today to Public Housing Authorities and owners of HUD-assisted housing regarding the use of arrests in determining who can live in HUD-assisted properties. This Guidance will also clarify the Department\u2019s position on \u201cone strike\u201d policies and will include best practices from Public Housing Authorities. \n \n The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will release guidance today to Public Housing Authorities and owners of HUD-assisted housing regarding the use of arrests in determining who can live in HUD-assisted properties.

Banning the Box in Federal Employment. The President has called on Congress to follow a growing number of states, cities, and private companies that have decided to \u201cban the box\u201d on job applications. We are encouraged that Congress is considering bipartisan legislation that would \u201cban the box\u201d for federal hiring and hiring by federal contractors. In the meantime, the President is directing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to take action where it can by modifying its rules to delay inquiries into criminal history until later in the hiring process. While most agencies already have taken this step, this action will better ensure that applicants from all segments of society, including those with prior criminal histories, receive a fair opportunity to compete for Federal employment. \n \n The President has called on Congress to follow a growing number of states, cities, and private companies that have decided to \u201cban the box\u201d on job applications.

TechHire : Expanding tech training and jobs for individuals with criminal records. As a part of President Obama\u2019s TechHire initiative, over 30 communities are taking action \u2013 working with each other and national employers \u2013 to expand access to tech jobs for more Americans with fast track training like coding boot camps and new recruitment and placement strategies. Today we are announcing the following new commitments: Memphis, TN and New Orleans, LA are expanding TechHire programs to support people with criminal records. Newark, NJ, working with the New Jersey Institute of Technology and employers like Audible, Panasonic, and Prudential, will offer training through the Art of Code program in software development with a focus on training and placement for formerly incarcerated people. New Haven, CT, Justice Education Center, New Haven Works, and others will launch a pilot program to train and place individuals with criminal records, and will start a program to train incarcerated people in tech programming skills. Washington, DC partners will train and place 200 formerly incarcerated people in tech jobs. They will engage IT companies to develop and/or review modifications to hiring processes that can be made for individuals with a criminal record. \n \n As a part of President Obama\u2019s TechHire initiative, over 30 communities are taking action \u2013 working with each other and national employers \u2013 to expand access to tech jobs for more Americans with fast track training like coding boot camps and new recruitment and placement strategies. Today we are announcing the following new commitments: Establishing a National Clean Slate Clearinghouse. In the coming weeks, the Department of Labor and Department of Justice will partner to establish a National Clean Slate Clearinghouse to provide technical assistance to local legal aid programs, public defender offices, and reentry service providers to build capacity for legal services needed to help with record-cleaning, expungement, and related civil legal services. \n \n In the coming weeks, the Department of Labor and Department of Justice will partner to establish a National Clean Slate Clearinghouse to provide technical assistance to local legal aid programs, public defender offices, and reentry service providers to build capacity for legal services needed to help with record-cleaning, expungement, and related civil legal services. Permanent Supportive Housing for the Reentry Population through Pay for Success. The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Bureau of Justice Assistance at the Department of Justice have launched an $8.7 million demonstration grant to address homelessness and reduce recidivism among the justice-involved population. The Pay for Success (PFS) Permanent Supportive Housing Demonstration will test cost-effective ways to help persons cycling between the criminal justice and homeless service systems, while making new Permanent Supportive Housing available for the reentry population. PFS is an innovative form of performance contracting for the social sector through which government only pays if results are achieved. This grant will support the design and launch of PFS programs to reduce both homelessness and jail days, saving funds to criminal justice and safety net systems. \n \n The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Bureau of Justice Assistance at the Department of Justice have launched an $8.7 million demonstration grant to address homelessness and reduce recidivism among the justice-involved population.

Juvenile Reentry Assistance Program Awards to Support Public Housing Residents. With funding provided by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will provide $1.75 million to aid eligible public housing residents who are under the age of 25 to expunge or seal their records in accordance with their applicable state laws. In addition, the National Bar Association \u2013 the nation\u2019s oldest and largest national association of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges \u2013 has committed to supplementing this program with 4,000 hours of pro bono legal services. Having a criminal record can result in major barriers to securing a job and other productive opportunities in life, and this program will enable young people whose convictions are expungable to start over. \n \n Many of the announcements being made today stem from the President\u2019s My Brother\u2019s Keeper Task Force, which is charged with addressing persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and ensuring all young people can reach their full potential. In May of 2014, the Task Force provided the President with a series of evidence-based recommendations focused on the six key milestones on the path to adulthood that are especially predictive of later success, and where interventions can have the greatest impact, including Reducing Violence and Providing a Second Chance. The Task Force, made up of key agencies across the Federal Government, has made considerable progress towards implementing their recommendations, many times creating partnerships across agencies and sectors. Today\u2019s announcements respond to a wide range of recommendations designed to \u201celiminate unnecessary barriers to giving justice-involved youth a second chance.\u201d \n \n These announcements mark a continuation of the Obama Administration\u2019s commitment to mitigating unnecessary collateral impacts of incarceration. In particular, the Administration has advanced numerous effective reintegration strategies through the work of the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, whose mission is to reduce recidivism and victimization; assist those returning from prison, jail or juvenile facilities to become productive citizens; and save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration. \n \n Through the Reentry Council and other federal agency initiatives, the Administration has improved rehabilitation and reintegration opportunities in meaningful ways, including recent initiatives in the following areas: \n \n Reducing barriers to employment. \n \n Last month, the Department of Justice awarded $3 million to provide technology-based career training for incarcerated adults and juveniles. These funds will be used to establish and provide career training programs during the 6-24 month period before release from a prison, jail, or juvenile facility with connections to follow-up career services after release in the community. \n \n The Department of Justice also announced the selection of its first-ever Second Chance Fellow, Daryl Atkinson. Recognizing that many of those directly impacted by the criminal justice system hold significant insight into reforming the justice system, this position was designed to bring in a person who is both a leader in the criminal justice field and a formerly incarcerated individual to work as a colleague to the Reentry Council and as an advisor to the Bureau of Justice Assistance Second Chance programs. \n \n In addition, the Department of Labor awarded a series of grants in June that are aimed at reducing employment barriers, including: \n \n Face Forward: The Department awarded $30.5 million in grants to provide services to youth, aged 14 to 24, who have been involved in the juvenile justice system. Face Forward gives youth a second chance to succeed in the workforce by removing the stigma of having a juvenile record through diversion and/or expungement strategies. \n \n The Department awarded $30.5 million in grants to provide services to youth, aged 14 to 24, who have been involved in the juvenile justice system. Face Forward gives youth a second chance to succeed in the workforce by removing the stigma of having a juvenile record through diversion and/or expungement strategies. Linking to Employment Activities Pre-Release (LEAP): The Department awarded $10 million in pilot grants for programs that place One Stop Career Center/American Job Centers services directly in local jails. These specialized services will prepare individuals for employment while they are incarcerated to increase their opportunities for successful reentry. \n \n The Department awarded $10 million in pilot grants for programs that place One Stop Career Center/American Job Centers services directly in local jails. These specialized services will prepare individuals for employment while they are incarcerated to increase their opportunities for successful reentry. Training to Work: The Department awarded $27.5 million in Training to Work grants to help strengthen communities where formerly incarcerated individuals return. Training to Work provides workforce-related reentry opportunities for returning citizens, aged 18 and older, who are participating in state and/or local work-release programs. The program focuses on training opportunities that lead to industry-recognized credentials and job opportunities along career pathways. \n \n Increasing access to education and enrichment. \n \n High-quality correctional education \u2014 including postsecondary correctional education \u2014 has been shown to measurably reduce re-incarceration rates. In July, the Departments of Education and Justice announced the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program to allow incarcerated Americans to receive Pell Grants to pursue postsecondary education and trainings that can help them turn their lives around and ultimately, get jobs, and support their families. Since this pilot was announced, over 200 postsecondary institutions across the nation have applied for consideration. \n \n In June, the Small Business Administration published a final rule for the Microloan Program that provides more flexibility to SBA non-profit intermediaries and expands the pool of microloan recipients. The change will make small businesses that have an owner who is currently on probation or parole eligible for microloan programs, aiding individuals who face significant barriers to traditional employment to reenter the workforce. \n \n Expanding opportunities for justice-involved youth to serve their communities. \n \n In October, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice announced a new round of Youth Opportunity AmeriCorps grants aimed at enrolling at-risk and formerly incarcerated youth in national service projects. These grants, which include $1.2 million in AmeriCorps funding, will enable 211 AmeriCorps members to serve through organizations in Washington, D.C. and four states: Maine, Maryland, New York, and Texas. \n \n In addition, the Department of Labor partnered with the Department of Defense\u2019s National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program and awarded three $4 million grants in April of this year to provide court-involved youth with work experiences, mentors, and vocational skills training that prepares them for successful entry into the workforce. \n \n Increasing access to health care and public services. \n \n In October, the Department of Justice announced $6 million in awards under the Second Chance Act to support reentry programming for adults with co-occurring substance abuse and mental disorders. This funding is aimed at increasing the screening and assessment that takes place during incarceration as well as improving the provision of treatment options. \n \n In September, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) at HHS announced the winners of its reintegration toolkit challenge to develop software applications aimed at transforming existing resources into user-friendly tools with the potential to promote successful reentry and reduce recidivism. And in October, HHS issued a \u201cGuide for Incarcerated Parents with Children in the Child Welfare System\u201d in order to help incarcerated parents who have children in the child welfare system, including in out-of-home-care, better understand how the child welfare system works so that they can stay in touch.\u201d The information can be found at: http://youth.gov/youth-topics/children-of-incarcerated-parents. \n \n The Social Security Administration (SSA) finalized written statewide prerelease agreements in September with the Department of Corrections in Iowa and Kansas. These agreements \u2013 now covering the majority of states \u2013 ensure continuity of services for returning citizens. SSA also has prisoner SSN replacement card MOUs in place with 39 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. A dedicated reentry webpage is accessible at www.socialsecurity.gov/reentry. \n \n Increasing reentry service access to incarcerated veterans. \n \n In September, the Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service announced the award of $1.5 million in grants to help once incarcerated veterans considered \"at risk\" of becoming homeless. In all, seven grants will serve more than 650 formerly incarcerated veterans in six states. \n \n The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also has developed a web-based system \u2013 the Veterans Reentry Search Service (VRSS) \u2013 that allows prison, jail, and court staff to quickly and accurately identify veterans among their populations. The system also prompts VA field staff \u2013 automatically \u2013 so that they can efficiently connect veterans with services. As of this summer, more than half of all state prison systems, and a growing number of local jails, are now using VRSS to identify veterans in their populations. \n \n Improving opportunities for children of incarcerated parents and their families. \n \n In October, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took action to make it easier for incarcerated individuals to stay in touch with their families by capping all in-state and interstate prison phone rates. The FCC also put an end to most of the fees imposed by inmate calling service providers. Studies have consistently shown that inmates who maintain contact with their families experience better outcomes and are less likely to return to prison after they are released. Reduced phone rates will make calls significantly more affordable for inmates and their families, including children of incarcerated parents, who often live in poverty and were at times charged $14 per minute phone rates. \n \n In October, the Department of Justice announced new grant awards to fund mentoring services for incarcerated fathers who are returning to their families. These awards will fund mentoring and comprehensive transitional services that emphasize development of parenting skills in incarcerated young fathers. \n \n Moreover, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice has awarded $1 million to promote and expand services to children who have a parent who is incarcerated in a Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) correctional facility. This program aims to provide opportunities for positive youth development, and to identify effective strategies and best practices that support children of incarcerated parents, including mentoring and comprehensive services that facilitate healthy and positive relationships. In addition to engaging the parent while he or she is incarcerated, this solicitation also supports the delivery of transitional reentry services upon release. \n \n Private Sector Commitments to Support Reentry. \n \n The Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), an organization that provides comprehensive employment services to people with recent criminal convictions, has committed to more than double the number of people served from 4,500 to 11,000 across existing geographies and 3-5 new states. This winter, CEO will open in San Jose with support from Google and in the next year, the team will launch in Los Angeles. This growth has been catalyzed by federal investments, including support from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Social Innovation Fund, and a Department of Labor Pay for Success Project. \n \n In addition, Cengage Learning will roll out Smart Horizons Career Online Education in correctional facilities in up to four new states over the next 12 months, providing over 1,000 new students with the opportunity to earn a high-school diploma and/or career certificate online. Smart Horizons Career Online Education is the world\u2019s first accredited online school district, with a focus on reaching underserved populations. The program has been piloted in Florida with 428 students who have received diplomas or certificates. ||||| Washington (CNN) The White House and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took turns lambasting each others' records on criminal justice Monday, as President Barack Obama traveled to Christie's state to promote new initiatives to rehabilitate former prison inmates. \n \n Speaking on CNN's \"New Day,\" Christie claimed his own policing reforms in the Garden State had led to falling murder rates, adding later Obama \"has not supported law enforcement in this country.\" \n \n Christie later said Obama was attempting to take credit for reforms he wasn't party to. \n \n \"All of these criminal justice reforms, none of them are his,\" Christie told reporters outside Camden, New Jersey, suggesting Obama was taking a \"victory lap\" at Integrity House, a drug rehabilitation center and halfway house in Newark the president stopped at Monday. \n \n Speaking aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Josh Earnest countered that Christie was simply seeking to elevate his standing in the 2016 GOP primary contest, where he's currently running near the back of a crowded field of candidates. \n \n \"Gov. Christie's comments in this regard have been particularly irresponsible, but not surprising for somebody whose poll numbers are close to an asterisk,\" Earnest said. \"Clearly this is part of his strategy for turning that around. We'll see if it works.\" \n \n In Newark, Obama made his latest push for criminal justice reform, which has become a key domestic priority for the White House. The new actions include \"banning the box\" requiring applicants to disclose their criminal background on job applications at federal agencies. \n \n At Integrity House, Obama met with a former inmate and staff at the residential facility. Later he participated in a roundtable on prisoner re-entry into society at Rutgers University, where he addressed the hardships former inmates face when applying for jobs. \n \n \"That's bad not only for those individuals, but for our economy,\" he said. \"It's bad for those communities that desperately need more role models who are gainfully employed. We've got to make sure Americans who have paid their debt to society can earn their second chance.\" \n \n The White House Monday announced new actions to promote rehabilitation and reintegration, including $8 million in education grants from the Department of Education and tech training and jobs for individuals with a criminal record. \n \n Obama is also calling on Congress to \"ban the box\" on federal job applications that requires job applicants to state if they have a criminal record. \n \n \"Each year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from state and federal prisons,\" the White House said in a statement. \"Advancing policies and programs that enable these men and women to put their lives back on track and earn their second chance promotes not only justice and fairness, but also public safety.\" \n \n The Federal Bureau of Prisons announced in October that they would grant early release to about 6,000 inmates between October 30 and November 2. \n \n The prisoners have served an average of nine years and were due to be released in about 18 months, according to a Justice Department official. Many were already in half-way houses. \n \n This is the latest push for criminal just reform from the Obama administration. In July, Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison and met with six inmates. \n \n Obama told NBC's Lester Holt in an exclusive interview clip airing Monday that he's proud of the work he's been able to do on behalf of racial injustice, but said it must continue under the next president. ||||| NEWARK -- President Obama, who has embraced the cause of overhauling the nation's criminal justice system, used New Jersey's largest city as the backdrop Monday to call attention to programs designed to successfully return ex-prisoners to society. \n \n Obama, making his third trip to the Garden State in a year, visited a Newark facility that provides services to 2,400 people each year, including drug treatment and help with housing and jobs. He held a roundtable discussion at Rutgers-Newark's Center for Law and Justice before speaking at the campus. \n \n \"There are people across the board -- folks who work inside the criminal justice system, folks who are affected by the criminal justice system, who are saying, 'There's got to be a better way,'\" Obama told a crowd of 226 at the university. \n \n RELATED: Obama's Newark trip highlights Booker's criminal justice efforts \n \n The president announced several steps along those lines, including naming Newark one of five new municipalities that will work with local colleges and employers to offer job training and placement for former prisoners. \n \n He announced programs to help juveniles seal criminal records and to improve the chances of former prisoners to get government jobs, and grants to provide education and other help for ex-convicts returning to society. \n \n \"We need to make sure Americans who paid their debt to society can earn a second chance,\" Obama said. \"We have seen people who are doing just that.\" \n \n While Obama, a Democrat, was announcing his initiatives in Newark, Gov. Chris Christie -- a Republican presidential candidate -- was highlighting his own efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system in Camden, which the president visited in May to discuss its progress in improving relations between police and the communities they are sworn to protect. Obama's trip came after several deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police. \n \n Unlike during Obama's December visit to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Christie was not at the airport to welcome the president. \n \n Obama's first step on his N.J. trip was Integrity House, a non-profit rehabilitation organization that works with drug-and alcohol-addicted criminals. Accompanied by Robin Shorter, director of the Women's Outpatient Programs and director of the Women's Halfway House, he met with three of the residents. \n \n He then discussed criminal justice issues at Rutgers-Newark around a horseshoe-shaped table with some former prisoners and others involved in helping them return to society. \n \n \n \n Rutgers-Newark's School of Criminal Justice hosts the New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education in Prisons program, which provides courses for prisoners and then helps them continue their education once released. The program works with the state Department of Corrections and State Parole Board. \n \n In Newark, they are doing \"extraordinary work,\" Obama said, singling out by name some of the people he met on his visit, both those who are trying to become productive members of society and those who are helping them do it. \n \n Accompanying the president on his trip was Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who has made criminal justice a signature issue since being elected to the Senate. Booker, a former Newark mayor, helped broker a deal with Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and other senators of both parties on a compromise bill that reduces some mandatory sentences and provides certain federal inmates with job training, drug treatment and a chance to be released from prison early. \n \n Obama endorsed that legislation. \"This is an area where we have really seen some strong bipartisan work,\" he said. \n \n Jonathan D.

And that\u2019s what we have to invest in. That\u2019s what we have to believe. That\u2019s what we have to promote.\u201d \n \n Mr. Obama directed the federal Office of Personnel Management to delay inquiries into criminal history until later in the hiring process for most competitive federal jobs so applicants are not rejected before having a chance to make a positive impression. Most federal agencies have already taken this step, but officials said new rules would be published in the new year banning requests for criminal backgrounds until the most qualified applicants are sent to a hiring manager.

Story Highlights Superior Court judge: du Pont heir \"will not fare well\" in prison \n \n Court records show Richards as 6-foot-4, between 250 and 276 pounds. \n \n Jurden ordered Richards to \"participate in a sex offenders\" treatment program \n \n A Superior Court judge who sentenced a wealthy du Pont heir to probation for raping his 3-year-old daughter noted in her order that he \"will not fare well\" in prison and needed treatment instead of time behind bars, court records show. \n \n Judge Jan Jurden's sentencing order for Robert H. Richards IV suggested that she considered unique circumstances when deciding his punishment for fourth-degree rape. Her observation that prison life would adversely affect Richards was a rare and puzzling rationale, several criminal justice authorities in Delaware said. Some also said her view that treatment was a better idea than prison is a justification typically used when sentencing drug addicts, not child rapists. \n \n Richards' 2009 rape case became public this month after attorneys for his ex-wife Tracy filed a lawsuit seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the abuse of his daughter. \n \n The fact that Jurden expressed concern that prison wasn't right for Richards came as a surprise to defense lawyers and prosecutors who consider her a tough sentencing judge. Several noted that prison officials can put inmates in protective custody if they are worried about their safety, noting that child abusers are sometimes targeted by other inmates. \n \n \"It's an extremely rare circumstance that prison serves the inmate well,\" said Delaware Public Defender Brendan J. O'Neill, whose office represents defendants who cannot afford a lawyer. \"Prison is to punish, to segregate the offender from society, and the notion that prison serves people well hasn't proven to be true in most circumstances.\" \n \n O'Neill said he and his deputies have often argued that a defendant was too ill or frail for prison, but he has never seen a judge cite it as a \"reason not to send someone to jail.\" \n \n Commentary: Take into account entire sentencing process \n \n Our view: Real questions about the Richards case \n \n Earlier story: Police investigated du Pont sex abuse claim \n \n Earlier story: Du Pont heir faces child sex lawsuit \n \n Richards was no frail defendant, court records show, listing him at 6 feet, 4 inches tall and between 250 and 276 pounds. Nor do court records cite any physical illnesses. \n \n O'Neill said the way the Richards case was handled might cause the public to be skeptical about \"how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system.\" \n \n Richards, who is unemployed and supported by a trust fund, owns a 5,800-square-foot mansion in Greenville he bought for $1.8 million in 2005. He also lists a home in the exclusive North Shores neighborhood near Rehoboth Beach, according to the state's sex abuse registry. His great-grandfather is du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont, and his father is Robert H. Richards III, a retired partner in the Richards Layton & Finger law firm. \n \n Buy Photo 04/04/12-Wilmington, De.-xxxf.dpc.doj-Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden answers a question from a public defender after holding Mental Health court on Wednesday, April 4, 2012. The News Journal/JENNIFER CORBETT (Photo: The News Journal/JENNIFER CORBETT) \n \n Jurden, who has been a judge since 2001, and Superior Court President James T. Vaughn Jr. did not respond to questions last week about the case. \n \n Deputy State Court Administrator Amy Quinlan said in an email that judges must consider the charges, state sentencing guidelines and \"any mitigating or aggravating factors and recommendations\" from prosecutors, defense lawyers, corrections officials and others. \"That procedure was followed in this case as well.\" \n \n The lawsuit filed by Richards' ex-wife accuses him of admitting to sexually abusing his infant son between 2005 and 2007, the same period when he abused his daughter starting when she was 3. \n \n Police said they investigated allegations involving the boy in 2010 after his mother filed a complaint, but said they did not have sufficient evidence to justify charges. Investigators will take another look at the allegations included in the lawsuit, which are based on reports by probation officers. \n \n CLOSE Robert H. Richards IV, a du Pont family heir who raped his 3-year-old daughter nearly a decade ago but received no prison time now faces a lawsuit from his former wife that accuses him of sexually abusing his toddler son. (3/18/14) \n \n The plea offer \n \n Attorney General Beau Biden's office had initially indicted Richards on two counts of second-degree rape of a child \u2013 Class B violent felonies that carry a mandatory 10-year prison term for each count. \n \n According to the arrest warrant filed by a New Castle County Police Detective JoAnna Burton in December 2007, the girl, then 5, told her grandmother, Donna Burg, that Richards sexually abused her. \n \n Burg said the child reported that her father told her it was \"our little secret\" but said she didn't want \"my daddy touching me anymore.\" The girl said her father molested her in the bedrooms of her mother and brother in the mansion at 10 Summit Lane near Winterthur Museum, the arrest warrant said. \n \n Tracy Richards, who confronted her then-husband, told police he admitted abusing his daughter but said \"it was an accident and he would never do it again,\" the warrant said. \n \n Richards was free on $60,000 secured bail while awaiting trial on the charges that could have put him behind bars for years. \n \n But in June 2008, just days before a scheduled trial, prosecutor Renee Hrivnak offered Richards a plea to a single count of fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory time, and he accepted, admitting in court that he abused his child. \n \n \"It was more than reasonable, an enlightened plea offer,\" Richards attorney Eugene J. Maurer Jr. said. \n \n Probation offered \n \n Fourth-degree rape is a Class C violent felony that by law can bring up to 15 years in prison, though guidelines suggest zero to 2\u00bd years in prison. \n \n At his February 2009 sentencing, Hrivnak recommended probation, Biden's chief deputy Ian R. McConnel said, adding that in retrospect he wished she would have sought prison time. Hrivnak would not comment. \n \n Biden spokesman Jason Miller said the attorney general \u2013 who routinely hails the prosecution of child predators as a top priority for his office \u2013 did not know about the case. \n \n Miller said only Hrivnak and her supervisor, Allison Texter, were part of the decision on how to resolve the case. Texter, who is now in private practice in Wilmington, did not return calls for comment. \n \n State Prosecutor Kathleen M. Jennings could not discuss the case, McConnel said, because she had represented Richards while he was on probation. Jennings, a former chief deputy attorney general, rejoined the office in November 2011 after about 15 years in private practice. She would not say when she represented Richards. \n \n McConnel would not discuss the rationale behind the Richards' plea deal and Hrivnak's recommendation of probation for the fourth-degree rape conviction. \n \n He noted, however that prosecutors handling child sex cases routinely have difficulty relying on the testimony of youngsters, especially if the defendant is their father. The well-being of the child is paramount in such cases and parents and prosecutors are often reluctant to put children through the trauma of testifying and being cross-examined, he said. \n \n \"These cases are extremely complicated and difficult and we strive to do justice in each and every case to the best of our ability given the facts and circumstances presented,\" McConnel said. \"That sometimes results in a resolution that is less than what we would want.\" \n \n 'Will not fare well' \n \n While judges have the latitude to sentence defendants within legal parameters, they are urged to follow more lenient guidelines established by the Delaware Sentencing Accountability Commission, a panel of judges and other top officials in the criminal justice system. The panel, known as SENTAC, has a policy that prison should be reserved for violent offenders, including rapists. \n \n Jurden gave Richards, who had no previous criminal record, an eight-year prison term, but suspended all the prison time for probation. \n \n \"Defendant will not fare well in Level 5 setting,\" said the final line of her sentencing order. In Delaware's correctional system, Level 5 is prison. \n \n Joseph S. Grubb, chief New Castle County prosecutor, said he was not involved in the case, but stressed that whether Richards' might suffer or thrive in prison was not something prosecutors considered. \n \n \"It's not a concern for us,\" Grubb said. \"We try to do the right thing in each case. Absent that equation is the physical condition of the defendant.\" \n \n Grubb said he did not know \"how the judge gathered\" that Richards might have trouble in prison, but assumed the presentence report included information she used. That report was not available in the court file. \n \n Buy Photo Delaware Public Defender Brendan J. O\u2019Neill (Photo: The News Journal/FRED COMEGYS) \n \n O'Neill, the public defender, said that while Jurden's rationale surprised him, \"I commend her for making such a courageous ruling. When I find the appropriate place, I'm going to make that argument.\" \n \n Defense lawyer Michael W. Modica said he has argued that clients should be spared prison because of medical or mental issues, but judges routinely reject the suggestion. He said he recently persuaded a prosecutor not to recommend prison for a client who had cardiac bypass surgery while awaiting sentencing for a DUI, and the judge sentenced the man to home confinement. \n \n \"I've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well,\" Modica said. \"Who thrives in jail?\" \n \n Treatment sentence \n \n Jurden also ordered Richards to \"participate in a sex offenders\" treatment program after his lawyer provided her with an evaluation from a clinic in Massachusetts. Her order stipulated that he undergo inpatient treatment followed by outpatient treatment. The judge also ordered him to have no contact with children under 16 and prohibited him from possessing pornography. \n \n Jurden's order also included other mitigating circumstances considered before sentencing, citing his \"strong family support\" and \"significant treatment needs which must be met.\" The order noted, \"Treatment needs exceed need for punishment,\" which the SENTAC manual lists as a factor for judges to consider. \n \n Attorneys said a treatment sentence is more common for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers and the mentally ill, but is not unheard of for sex offenders. \"It's not completely out of left field that a judge would say that,\" Grubb said. \n \n Prosecutor Josette Manning, who spent six years in the sex crimes unit, said juvenile offenders in Delaware are often sent to out-of-state treatment facilities rather than a detention center. Some adults can get sex treatment in prison, she said, but when an offender can afford to pay the cost of inpatient treatment themselves, judges sometimes make that part of the sentence instead of prison. \n \n \"It's absolutely appropriate for a judge to consider a defendant's treatment needs during sentencing\" for sex crimes, Manning said. \n \n Modica, who has represented numerous sex offenders, said he has seen the need for treatment as a factor in reduced sentences for defendants in child porn cases but not for sex crimes. \"I can't think of a case like that,\" he said. \n \n Richards spent eight months on Level 3 probation, which requires weekly contacts with a probation officer, before Jurden moved him down to Level 2, which requires only monthly visits with a probation officer. \n \n 'Right on' \n \n County police chief Elmer Setting said that while police can't control how attorneys and a judge resolve a case, \"In serious situations where we have a guilty plea, we hope for prison time.\" \n \n Kendall Marlowe, executive director of National Association for Counsel for Children, said the bottom line is that individuals who abuse youngsters deserve to be punished. \n \n \"Child protection laws are there to safeguard children, and adults who knowingly harm children should be punished,\" said Marlow, whose nonprofit agency assists lawyers who handle child welfare cases. \n \n \"Our prisons should be more rehabilitative environments, but the prison system's inadequacies are not a justification for letting a child molester off the hook.\" \n \n Defense lawyer Joseph A. Hurley said it makes sense to him that the judge would be concerned about Richards' time in prison. \n \n \"Sure, they have protective custody, but that is solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.

Richards IV was charged with fourth-degree rape in 2009 after he admitted that he had raped his daughter almost a decade ago. \n \n \n \n News of the shocking leniency shown to Richards, 46, only emerged on Tuesday in the details of a lawsuit filed against him by his ex-wife Tracy. \n \n Robert H. Richards IV was charged with fourth-degree rape in 2009 after he admitted that he had raped his daughter almost a decade ago \n \n News of the shocking leniency shown to Richards emerged just last Tuesday in the details of a lawsuit filed against him by his ex-wife Tracy \n \n In her lawsuit, Tracy Richards charges that he penetrated his daughter with his fingers while masturbating, and subsequently also assaulted his toddler son as well. \n \n \n \n Tracy Richards, who along with the two children now live in a rental home, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for assault, negligence, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress on his two children. \n \n \n \n Robert Richards is an unemployed heir living off his trust fund. He is the great grandson of du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont, a chemical baron. \n \n \n \n According to the lawsuit filed by Richards' ex-wife, he also admitted to sexually assaulting his infant son in addition to his daughter between 2005 and 2007. \n \n \n \n Richards was initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, felonies that translate to a 10-year mandatory jail sentence per count. He was released on $60,000 bail while awaiting his charges. \n \n \n \n Judge Jan Jurden, right, said Roberts, the great grandson of Irenee du Pont, left, would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time \n \n Richards hired one of the state's top law firms and was offered a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape charges - which carried no mandatory minimum prison sentencing. \n \n \n \n He accepted, and admitted to the assault, reports the Detroit Free Press. \n \n Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to eight years in prison but suspended that for Level II probation, which requires monthly visits with a case officer. \n \n In sentencing him, Judge Jurden said Richards would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time. \n \n \n \n Currently on probation, Richards has never been charged with crimes against his son. \n \n The lawsuit claims that Richards raped his daughter, now 11, in 2005 when she was three. \n \n \n \n Lawyers for Tracy Richards, far right, hold up photos of where her husband lives, the $1.8m mansion on the right and where she and their children currently rent on the left \n \n Several times, he entered her bedroom at night while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while masturbating, said the lawsuit, which includes documents from the criminal case. \n \n Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for. \n \n Richards, who is 6'4 and about 250 lbs, told the girl 'to keep what he had done to her a secret,' but in October 2007 she told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards, the lawsuit said. \n \n \n \n The girl was taken to her pediatrician, whom she told about the abuse, and New Castle County police arrested him that December. \n \n Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for, pictured \n \n The proven abuse of his daughter and alleged assault of his son has caused his children 'long-term injuries,' the lawsuit filed Tuesday said, perhaps including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction and shame. \n \n His daughter also has 'repressed memories of some instances of the abuse she suffered,' and if the son was abused, the same is true with him, the suit said. \n \n \n \n With medical treatment, the lawsuit said, those memories will likely 'begin to surface.' \n \n 'Making matters worse this self admitted rapist and child abuser has not paid a single penny to these children for his crimes. There is no provision whatsoever for them for their future after they turn 18,' said Attorney Thomas Crumplar, who is representing Tracy Richards. \n \n \n \n At Tuesday's press conference he stood alongside Tracy and her mother Donna Burg. Burg, the maternal grandmother, is the one who alarmed Tracy of the abuse after talking to one of the grandchildren in 2007. \n \n \n \n Richards is a scion of two prominent Delaware families - the du Pont family who built the chemical empire and the Richards family who co-founded the prestigious corporate law firm Richards Layton & Finger. \n \n \n \n His father, Robert H. Richards III, was a partner in the law firm until his 2008 retirement. \n \n \n \n Video: Du Pont heir sued over abusing his own children \n \n",

Richards IV, who admitted to raping his 3-year-old daughter almost a decade ago, the Daily Mail reports. In a 2009 case that's only now coming to light, the News Journal reports that Delaware Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to an eight-year prison term but suspended it for probation, plus a sex offenders rehabilitation program, because Richards \"will not fare well\" in prison and \"treatment needs exceed need for punishment.\" The News Journal calls it \"a rare and puzzling rationale\" from a judge who is known for her tough sentencing, especially given that treatment is usually reserved for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers, and the mentally ill. While some attorneys say such a sentence isn't unheard of, a public defender notes that the case raises questions about \"how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system.\" A defense lawyer adds, \"I've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well ... Who thrives in jail?\" A suit recently filed against Richards by his ex-wife is seeking damages for assaults on the couple's two children. Initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, Richards took a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory minimum prison sentence, the Daily Mail notes.",

Thousands of troops and police were placed at stations, departments stores and places of worship as France confronted the worst single terrorist attack on its soil for decades. \n \n But as night fell, Paris, the ville lumiere (city of light) became a place first of dark reflection, but then something approaching burning defiance. \n \n Jamilla, 34, a school teacher from the Seine-St Denis department to the north east of central Paris where the killers seemed to have fled, pointed towards her poster, depicting a Muslim man in an embrace with a man representing Charlie Hebdo. \n \n People gather at the Place Royale in Nantes to show their solidarity for the victims of the attack in Paris (Getty) \n \n She told The Independent: \u201cI am Muslim and I defend until the end what this poster says - hate cannot win. These killers tried to kill not only people but also the idea of peace and debate. I won\u2019t let them do that and everyone in France won\u2019t let them do that. They had no right to use the name of Allah. Mohamed would be turning in his grave. Tonight we are all Charlie. \u201d \n \n The Twitter hashtag #JeSuisCharlie was tweeted 650,000 times in France in support of the dead and the right to satirical scurrilousness that they enshrined. \n \n By early evening some 15,000 people had gathered at Place de la R\u00e9publique, forcing police to close roads and Metro stations as crowds thronged to the largely spontaneous protest. Similar demonstrations took place in dozens of French towns and cities, including Lyon, Nantes, Strasbourg and St Etienne. \n \n In Paris, hundreds held up copies of Charlie Hebdo\u2019s most famous front pages - an image of Mohamed being pushed in a wheelchair by an Orthodox Jew and the \u201cLove: Stronger than hate\u201d image printed after the magazine\u2019s offices were firebombed in 2011. \n \n Jean-Yves Dupre, 47, a publishing manager at the Place de la R\u00e9publique, said: \u201cI read Charlie Hebdo. I don\u2019t always agree with it but it is funny as much as it is outraging. The question is who will make us laugh now? This is about the defence of liberty and the right to question.\u201d \n \n A man holds a placard reading: 'Freedom of the press is priceless, fundamentalism, of any kind, will not pass' as others hold up placards reading in French, 'I am Charlie' during a gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris (Getty) \n \n Marine Champ, 45, was also in the Paris crowd. She told Le Monde: \u201cI\u2019m proud to see all the people who have spontaneously come here to be together. The message is clear - the murderers will not win.\u201d \n \n As some 3,000 police were mobilised and the French terrorism alert raised to its highest level, armed office were placed outside the offices of media organisations in recognition of the particular strain of intolerance that raised its head at the point of two Kalashnikov-style rifles in Charlie Hebdo\u2019s second floor offices. \n \n Some questioned why the police presence at the magazine\u2019s offices, close to the headquarters of the left wing daily newspaper Liberation where there was another attack two years ago, had not matched the heavily-armed Gendarmerie detachment put into place in the hours after its editorial team was decimated. \n \n People gather in front of the 'Club de la presse' in Montpellier, to show their solidarity for the victims of the attack by unknown gunmen on the offices of the satirical weekly, 'Charlie Hebdo' (Getty) \n \n While one of the two police killed was a close protection office assigned to the weekly\u2019s editor - Stephane Charbonnier - the second, a 40-year-old named only as Ahmed, had arrived unarmed and riding a police mountain bike. \n \n One man stood near the cordoned off entry to Rue Nicolas Appert said: \u201cWhy weren\u2019t they waiting for these bastards to blow them away?\u201d \n \n The answer to the lower-key security presence seems to have been two-fold. Firstly, what was once a steady flow of threatening emails and telephones to the office of Charlie Hebdo had slowed to a thin trickle. But secondly, its staff had decided that they could abide carrying out their work, holding the feet of authority and demagogy to a fire of cutting humour, under a cloud of fear. \n \n A woman lays a candle during a gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris (Getty) \n \n Aurelie, 29, an artist who lives nearby the magazine\u2019s offices, said: \u201cI talked to one of the guys [from Charlie Hebdo] in a caf\u00e9 a year or so ago. He was relaxed. I think his point was that the paper stood for certain values and life had to be lived to prove those values. Somehow, if they changed their routine or sat about worried for themselves then they would be denying what they were about. They have paid a very terrible price for such courage.\u201d \n \n One Charlie Hebdo staff member told Le Monde: \u201cWe don\u2019t really take [the threats] seriously. We\u2019ve got used to it. More recently we\u2019d thought the threats would soon be a thing of the past.\u201d \n \n France will wake to a day of national mourning for a group of individuals who it seems chose to live by the invocation of Mr Charbonnier, known as Charb, when he said in 2012: \u201cI prefer to die standing than to live on my knees.\u201d \n \n In a dry cleaning shop not far from the magazine\u2019s offices, the manager Mohammad, from Algeria, shook his head in disbelief at the day\u2019s events. He said: \u201cWhat can I say? A newspaper isn\u2019t a gun. Who was ever killed by a sheet of paper? These men cannot win.

By now the comments are familiar to many, including the part where Trump boasts he can grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d if he feels like it. \n \n Given the highly charged situation, the top that Melania Trump, the candidate\u2019s wife, chose for the evening was risky, to say the least. She opted for what\u2019s called a \u201cpussy-bow\u201d blouse\u2014a sartorial reverberation of her husband\u2019s lewd remarks, apparently by Gucci in silk crepe de chine. \n \n There\u2019s no indication that the choice was meant to symbolize anything. The Trump campaign told CBS the choice was not intentional. But it didn\u2019t keep people from noticing. \n \n Campaign spokeswoman says this was not intentional. https://t.co/Yuka1Pli2j \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 10, 2016 \n \n The style, which has actually come back into fashion in recent months due largely to Gucci\u2019s influence, has a mixed history of its own\u2014especially among feminists, as I\u2019ve written. Some loathe it, because it recalls the way women entering the workforce en masse in the 1970s and 1980s had to conform to office dress codes established by men: The blouse was seen as the women\u2019s equivalent of the shirt and tie. \n \n Other women embrace that history, and the empowerment they find in the name, which some believe started because of the bow\u2019s resemblance to a vagina. (It\u2019s more likely the name is derived from the bows people used to tie on their cats\u2019 necks, as implied by the style\u2019s other name: the pussycat-bow.) \n \n The shirt also became closely associated with Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s prime minister throughout the 1980s. The conservative leader wore them because she found them \u201crather softening and pretty,\u201d as a contrast with her notoriously tough persona. \n \n Whatever Melania Trump meant to convey with her look, her pink bow unfortunately managed to remind many of her husband\u2019s comments about women\u2014which weren\u2019t pretty. ||||| Just a few days before the second presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, a video surfaced in which the Republican nominee boasts about participating in a form of sexual assault. Specifically, Trump tells then-\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush that he just goes up to \u201cbeautiful\u201d women and \u201cgrab[s] them by the p***y.\u201d What\u2019s more, Trump explains, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d \n \n For the Trump campaign, \u201cP***gate\u201d is the stuff of nightmares. In the minds of many pundits, it\u2019s a near fatal blow that has cost the business magnate crucial endorsements, female votes and any edge running mate Mike Pence had won for their ticket in last week\u2019s vice presidential debate. \n \n For the political party of the elephant, it was undoubtedly the elephant in the room. So, imagine fashion connoisseurs\u2019 surprise when they noticed that Melania Trump walked into the debate hall wearing Gucci\u2019s fuchsia pussy-bow blouse. \n \n WWW.NET-A-PORTER.COM \n \n Yes, you read right. In the fashion world, a women\u2019s blouse with a bow tied at the neck is known as a pussy bow or pussycat bow. The look became popular in the mid-20th century, thanks to such designers as Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Omar Kiam. In fact, after Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979, the pussy bow became a signature part of her look. \n \n Rick Wilking-Pool/Getty Images \n \n According to retail website MatchesFashion.com, \u201cA pussybow blouse is one of the prettiest ways to embrace Gucci\u2019s new-found eclecticism. This fuchsia-pink design is cut in Italy from silk-georgette, and detailed with softly gathered shoulders and buttoned cuffs to maximise the vintage vibes. Tuck it into a knife-pleated skirt, finishing with statement accessories.\u201d \n \n Melania, for her part, chose to pair the ironically named blouse with a pair of matching fuchsia-pink pants -- a choice that set social media on fire. \n \n The Trump campaign maintains that the choice of blouses was made exclusively for aesthetics, not monikers. The Internet, it seems, will agree to disagree. ||||| An unfortunate choice? Melania Trump was stylish in a fuchsia top paired with matching pants while supporting husband Donald Trump at the second presidential debate on Sunday, October 9. \n \n But while she looked great, the $1,100 Gucci shirt was perhaps not quite the best fashion choice given the blouse's style: pussy bow. Just two days earlier, a 2005 video surfaced in which the Republican presidential nominee was recorded on an Access Hollywood bus bragging about groping women's genitals. \n \n \"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful \u2014 I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. When when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" the business mogul, 70, told then Access Hollywood host Billy Bush during the conversation. \"Grab them by the p\u2014y. You can do anything.\" \n \n He also boasted about trying to seduce a married woman, who Access Hollywood has since identified as Nancy O'Dell. \n \n A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told CBS News Sunday night that the former model's shirt choice \"was not intentional.\" \n \n Viewers of the debate were quick to ponder on Twitter why she may have selected to wear this particular style after the presidential hopeful's latest scandal: \n \n Melania is going to vote for HRC the #PussyBow and matching pants (suit) confirm that she is a double agent. pic.twitter.com/uUscYfEOOG \u2014 Christen Clifford (@cd_clifford) October 10, 2016 \n \n Love Melania's pussy-bow blouse, wonder if her husband grabbed it from the closet for her? \u2014 Lizabeth (@lilbit_liebs) October 10, 2016 \n \n https://twitter.com/stellabugbee/status/785323907184222208 \n \n It seems both Melania Trump's speech writer and stylist do not read the news and/or do their research #pussybow #debates via @MegletNY pic.twitter.com/icOfAsZCjg \u2014 Kristen Massaro (@KreeBeau) October 10, 2016 \n \n Though Melania, 46, attended the debate, she did condemn her husband's lewd remarks. \"The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,\" she said in a statement Saturday. \"This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have.\" \n \n But according to The New York Times, the former model refused to do a joint TV appearance with her husband to address his 2005 comments. \n \n The presidential hopeful initially labeled his words as \"locker room banter,\" which he reiterated again during Sunday's presidential debate. After co-moderator Anderson Cooper pressed him on the topic, the former Apprentice star denied that he had sexually assaulted women. \n \n Bush, 44, who was heard also making inappropriate comments in the leaked video, has been suspended from the Today show. \n \n Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox! \n \n Want stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

    "document": "SCHERTZ, Texas - The Bexar County Sheriff says it appears a deadly deputy-involved shooting that claimed the lives of a suspect and a 6-year-old boy was a \"tragic accident.\" \n \n Six-year-old Kameron Prescott was killed when deputies opened fire on a woman at a mobile home park following a nearly two-hour manhunt. Authorities say the woman was a wanted felon and car-theft suspect. \n \n During a news conference Thursday, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said authorities were looking for a female suspect in the area of Farm to Market 1518 and Schaefer Road after a vehicle was reported stolen just before 11 a.m. The suspect has been identified as 30-year-old Amanda Lene Jones. Officials said John Aguillon (27 service years), George Herrera (16 years), Jesse Arias (seven years) and reserve deputy Johnny Longoria (two years) were involved in the shooting. \n \n \n \n Salazar stated one of the deputies found the suspect in a closet who allegedly told him,\"I have a weapon, I'm gonna shoot you.\" She fled on foot, while the officer pursued her into a wooded area. Salazar said the deputy lost sight of her, so the deputy called for backup. The suspect was found crossing a river, and officers pursued her in \"water that was up to their chin.\" \n \n She was threatening harm to several witnesses, leading them to believe she was armed, Salazar said. Deputies later found the female suspect on a porch, after she had broken into a house. She has several felony warrants in her name, Salazar said. \n \n Salazar said the deputies fired at and killed the woman at the scene because she placed them \"in direct fear of their lives.\" One of the rounds also went into the house, striking Kameron Prescott in the abdomen. \n \n Salazar held a news conference Friday afternoon, providing a chronological breakdown of the events which led up to the shooting and showing a map of the route taken while deputies pursued the suspect into the mobile home park. Salazar said witnesses at the mobile home park also reported seeing the suspect holding an object that may have been a weapon. \n \n Salazar said investigators learned the suspect had physically forced her way inside a home where an adult, a minor female, and 6-year-old Kameron Prescott were staying and made threats, including threatening to take the family's car. \n \n WATCH: Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar holds a news conference Friday afternoon to provide an update on the investigation. \n \n He stated that at some point, the suspect stepped out onto the porch of the home, where she was confronted by five deputies. Salazar said she again threatened to shoot the deputies, which he said was confirmed by the family inside the home. He said the deputies saw her holding something in her hand which they believed was a weapon. \n \n Salazar said investigators later found a dark \"tubular\" object with blood on it below the desk of the home and stated it's likely that she had the object in her hand before the shooting.

(Photo courtesy the Kassig family) \n \n The possible next victim of the Islamic State militant group is Army Ranger veteran Peter E. Kassig, who moved to the Middle East to do humanitarian work before being taken hostage. \n \n Kassig is shown at the end of a video released Friday that depicts the apparent beheading of Alan Henning, a British humanitarian aid worker who was taken hostage in Syria last year. Kassig started a small medical relief company known as Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, in 2012 that has headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, according to the company\u2019s LinkedIn page. The city is close to the Syrian border and a way station of sorts for relief workers and journalists. \n \n Kassig also was an employee with TYR Solutions LTD, a British firm that provides security and consulting and training for individuals planning to go to war zones, according to his LinkedIn profile. \n \n Kassig enlisted as an infantryman, and was in the Army from June 2006 to September 2007 before being medically discharged as a private first class, Army officials aid. He was with the Army\u2019s famous 75th Ranger Regiment from October 2006 to September 2007, and deployed with them to Iraq from April to July 2007. \n \n Kassig said in an interview published by Time magazine last year that he traveled to the Middle East in 2012 after leaving the Army and while on spring break from Butler University in Indiana. He wanted to learn about the humanitarian crisis in Syria firsthand and see what he could do to raise awareness about it. \n \n In a web page raising funds for his cause, the former soldier said he felt that more could be done to help the Syrians, and thought the most effective way was \u201cthrough a close connection to those who were in desperate need, by meeting them where they were.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe may not have much but I have always felt that the reasons why you do something are as important as what you do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is about making a difference not just through material goods, but also the exchange of ideas and experiences that the interanational [sic] community benefits from through this type of iniative [sic].\u201d \n \n In a 2012 interview with CNN, Kassig said that he first traveled to the Lebanese capital of Beirut where he studied how complicated the conflict was. He said some people questioned what he was doing. He told CNN he also wondered whether America was doing enough to help, although he didn\u2019t support military intervention. \n \n \u201cThis is real, and it\u2019s scary stuff, and it\u2019s sad what is happening to people here,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cPeople back home need to know about it, they need to know.

I met this 24-year-old Indiana native while taking an entry-level Arabic course in Beirut last year. Since then, Peter has gone on to help Syrian refugees in a Lebanese hospital and recently started his own aid group called Special Emergency Response and Assistance \u2014 SERA. \n \n SERA\u2019s main focus right now \u201cis providing Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Syria with medical assistance, medical supplies, and clothing for refugees, and non-perishable food as well as cooking fuel, cooking stoves,\u201d and other supplies, according to its Facebook page. It wants to specialize in bringing in critical supplies to people in particularly dicey circumstances, which is an understatement when used to describe the refugee landscape within Syria. \n \n There are estimates that there are over 2.5 million internally displaced persons within the country, and nearly 500,000 who have left. \n \n The group recently finished its first week-and-half-long operation inside Syria. \n \n With just over $2,000 raised from donations, SERA set out to supply Syrian refugees in the north of the country with blankets. But the group soon realized that was not a pressing need when compared to the increasingly dire food situation. So SERA purchased two cooking stoves, 20 45-kilogram propane fuel tanks, a ton of rice and other food, and loaded it all into a truck its members drove across the border into Syria. They delivered it directly to the people in a Syrian refugee camp, according to Kassig\u2019s debrief on the operation. \n \n \u201cWe learned first-hand through this process just how difficult it is to get supplies into Syria,\u201d Kassig wrote, expressing frustration with delays. \u201cInnocent lives were lost in the days we were in the area of Qah Refugee camp attempting to deliver aid.\u201d \n \n While pledging to improve their effectiveness, Kassig wrote that he was inspired by the people in the camp: \u201cI did not meet a single man woman or child who could not muster a smile and a message of strength and hope that was nothing short of earth-shatteringly humbling.\u201d \n \n I asked Kassig a few questions about SERA and why he came back to the Middle East after his time in the Army. \n \n What drew you to Beirut? \n \n Originally, I came to Beirut on my spring break from [Butler] University last spring. I was interested in what I could learn about the Syrian crisis firsthand and what I could do to help and raise awareness about the crisis amongst my peers back at home in the United States. I was also interested in learning more about the Middle East in general from a civilian perspective. I wanted to better understand my role in the conflict in Iraq and its impact on the Middle East in general from a personal perspective and from the perspective of the Arab world. I hoped to gain insight into potential paths forward with regards to developing a new and improved relationship between my generation in both the Arab world and in the West. \n \n What have you been doing during your time in Lebanon? \n \n I started by travelling as much as possible throughout the country and focusing my efforts on volunteering on a small scale in a Palestinian refugee camp in South Beirut. I wanted to try and understand the full scope of the level of need and what role I could potentially have in meeting that need. I also volunteer in a hospital in Tripoli, Lebanon, offering my services as a trauma medic to Syrian refugees who have been wounded in the fighting in Syria. From these experiences I began the development of my NGO, SERA, which stands for Special Emergency Response and Assistance. I divide by time between my personal volunteer efforts, my organizations relief operations, which include the distribution of aid materials such as medical equipment and children\u2019s clothing, as well as food and cooking materials in both Lebanon and Syria. \n \n Tell us about your group, Special Emergency Response and Assistance. What does it do and why did you start it? \n \n I designed Special Emergency Response and Assistance around a belief that there was a lot of room for improvement in terms of how humanitarian organizations interact with and cooperate with the populations that they serve. SERA is focused on the distribution of aid materials to populations with an acute and immediate need. We administer aid in the form of food and cooking materials, medical supplies, and clothing. \n \n The idea is for SERA to supplement the efforts of larger organizations by focusing on delivering aid materials that can do the most good for the most people over the longest period of time possible. I believe that how and why we do what we do is equal in importance to what we do. It\u2019s about showing people that we care, that someone is looking out for those who might be overlooked or who have slipped through the cracks in the system for whatever reason. \n \n I started SERA because I felt that we could fill a niche as an organization that had not been filled. There are a lot of other wonderful organizations out there but we feel that by working directly with the people who are in need at a grassroots level allows for us to establish an invaluable personal relationship that not only allows us to effectively distribute material goods but also allows for an opportunity for an increased level of cooperation and an exchange of ideas between people from diverse backgrounds and experiences and that this enhances our ability to accurately meet needs. The personal connection is key. \n \n Does SERA team up with other organizations to help Syrian refugees? \n \n Yes. Part of our operational philosophy and founding principles is that there should be no wasted energy or redundancy in the operations we carry out. I believe in working as closely with the population in need as is possible. This allows for us to maximize our transparency and effectiveness of our operations based on the respect for and appreciation of the fact that people have the best understanding of what they need and many times, simply lack the means to carry out the ideas that they already have. \n \n What would you like to see SERA doing that it isn\u2019t already and what do you need to make that happen? \n \n I would like to see SERA responding to a variety of needs throughout the region in as short amount of time as possible. Our aim is to be a rapid response organization that can help to fill gaps in supply chains, or assist those who have fallen through the cracks. I would love it for SERA to be able to impact conditions on the ground in places like Lebanon and Syria in a more comprehensive and efficient way. \n \n To make this a reality we need to make sure we maintain our focus and our drive internally, we also need to make sure we maintain an operational tempo that allows for us to have good visibility on the conditions that the populations we serve are facing. Of course we definitely need more funding. Right now we have very little and so our operational scope is very small. We have the ability to serve much larger populations in a really effective way but we need a stronger budget to be able to conduct these sorts of operations. \n \n Where do you see yourself in five years? \n \n That is a good question. I believe that if you are passionate about something and you put the necessary effort into making it work (such as SERA) that it is ultimately up to you how long you can keep it viable. The work speaks for itself to some extent I think. I certainly plan on continuing to try and serve those who are in need for as long as I live. \n \n The truth is sometimes I really think I would like to do something else, but at the end of the day this work is really the only thing that I have found that gives my life both meaning and direction. In five years, I certainly hope to have seen SERA grow into an international relief organization capable of helping hundreds of thousands of people around the world. I would also like to be able to say that I was able to give something back to everyone who helped along the way. \n \n This work is important for the message that it sends to people back home, that one of the best aspects of the American way of life is our ability to come together in the face of adversity and to stand beside those who might need a helping hand. In five years, if I can look back on all of this and say that our organization is able to truly help people, that I was able so share a little bit of hope and that I never stopped learning then I will know this all stood for something. \n \n If people want to help SERA, what\u2019s something they can do? \n \n We can accept donations at a temporary account at: \n \n Epworth United Methodist Church \n \n 6450 Allisonville Road \n \n Indianapolis, IN 46220 \n \n Checks should be made out to Epworth United Methodist Church. In the memo line, people can put either \u201cSERA Relief Effort\u201d or \u201cPeter Kassig Relief Effort.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s not a religious thing, but my hometown neighborhood set this up for us in the meantime as a transparent and monitored donation system. SERA is a fully incorporated NGO, but our 501c3 [federal non-profit tax status] is still pending. ||||| Story highlights American Peter Kassig, 26, helped treat wounded Syrians \n \n He served in the U.S. military in Iraq but looked for a \"game changer\" after returning home \n \n His parents in Indianapolis, Indiana, confirmed he'd been taken hostage \n \n Kassig converted to Islam while being held hostage, family says \n \n Peter Kassig first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. \n \n \"We each get one life and that's it.

MUST WATCH Alan Henning killed by ISIS 01:53 \n \n Kassig's journey began when he joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2006 and deployed to Iraq in 2007. He was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour and returned to the United States to study political science and train for 1,500-meter races. But something wasn't right. \n \n \"I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,\" he said. \"I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose.\" \n \n In 2010, Kassig took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician. \n \n In the two years that followed, he fell in love, got married and quickly divorced. Devastated and heartbroken, he went back to school, but he couldn't shake his depression. \n \n \"I needed a game changer,\" he said. \n \n He decided he would head to Beirut, follow the situation in Syria and try to help. So, on his spring break this year he packed his medical kit and flew into the Lebanese capital. \n \n The next two weeks were filled with eye-opening misadventures as Kassig began to scratch the surface of the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the Middle East as a whole. \n \n Founded a humanitarian aid organization \n \n \"I had learned enough to know that I didn't know anything,\" he said. \n \n After finishing the semester back in the United States, he returned to Lebanon, only this time with a plan. \n \n \"The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do. I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes.\" \n \n Kassig founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a nongovernmental organization. In summer 2013 he moved its base of operations to Gaziantep, Turkey. \n \n Kassig's family said SERA was dedicated to providing first-response humanitarian aid for refugees fleeing the widening civil war in Syria. Kassig found and delivered food and medical supplies to the growing camps on both sides of the Syrian border, his family said, and provided primary trauma care and trauma care training to civilian casualties inside Syria. \n \n \"I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse,\" he said in the 2012 interview. \"But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose.\" \n \n He was undertaking a project for SERA when he was \"detained\" on October 1, 2013, on his way to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, according to his family's statement. \n \n \"For the past year, the Kassig family has maintained silence at the wish of those who have held their son,\" the family statement said. \"His family, along with friends and colleagues inside and outside Syria, have worked tirelessly, and quietly, to secure his release.\" \n \n Converted to Islam \n \n Kassig's family said he converted to Islam while being held hostage and now goes by Abdul-Rahman. \n \n The family said it \"understands from speaking to former hostages that Kassig's faith has provided him comfort during his long captivity.\" \n \n While working in hospitals, some of those Kassig helped treat were rebel fighters, all who vowed they would return to the battlefield as soon as they could. \n \n Others were the innocent victims of a spiraling conflict. \n \n One patient, 24-year-old Louliya, said she and her three children were run over by a military jeep as they tried to escape the Syrian military siege of their village. Her spinal cord was crushed, leaving her unable to move from the neck down. She was smuggled across the border to Lebanon for surgery. \n \n She smiled bravely but was unable to stop the tears from rolling down her face. \n \n \"All I want is to be able to hold my children in my arms again,\" she said softly, trying but failing to imitate the cradling of a child. \n \n He bonded with doctors, patients \n \n Kassig said his direct exposure to what was something of an alien conflict and culture before transformed his perspective. \n \n \"There is this mentality from where I come from back home that I have a little bit of a problem with,\" he said. \"I don't want to get on a political soap box, but at the same time we have to think about why as a country we choose to help certain people and not others. \n \n \"We have to think about why we just chalk up the Middle East [as] this complex enigma that we will never understand because they are so different from us. But at the end of the day, they are really not. It's just about whether or not you're willing to go out on a limb and understand something,\" he said. \n \n \"Peter can tell the American people who we are,\" said Marwan, a Syrian nurse he worked with. \"We are not what the regime says we are -- terrorists and al Qaeda. Peter knows we are good people, who love joking and laughter. We just want to live.\" \n \n Kassig was struck by the resilience of the Syrians he met, by their ability to smile and somehow joke even in the darkest of circumstances. \n \n \"This is real, and it's scary stuff, and it's sad what is happening to people here,\" he said. \"People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In its latest execution video, ISIS threatened that its next victim would be an American aid worker named Peter Kassig. The 26-year-old is a former Army Ranger from Indiana who served in Iraq in 2007 before being honorably discharged for medical reasons, reports CNN. He enrolled at Butler University upon his return to the US, but traveled to Libya on his spring break to learn about the Syria crisis. \"I wanted more of a challenge, more of a purpose,\" he told the network in a 2012 interview. Eventually, Kassig decided to stay full time to do humanitarian work and founded a relief group called the Special Emergency Response and Assistance, reports the Washington Post. In the last few years, he has been delivering food and medical supplies to refugees from the Syrian conflict. Kassig's parents today released a YouTube video pleading for his release. They refer to their son as \"Abdul-Rahman, formerly known as Peter.\" The Kassigs have previously said that their son converted to Islam while in captivity. A few quotes from Kassig, from CNN and from an interview last year with Time: \u201cThis is real, and it\u2019s scary stuff, and it\u2019s sad what is happening to people here. People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere.\u201d \"I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse. But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose.\" \"In five years, if I can look back on all of this and say that our organization is able to truly help people, that I was able so share a little bit of hope, and that I never stopped learning, then I will know this all stood for something.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The family of US aid worker Peter Kassig is \"saddened\" by the apparent beheading of his hostage, Alan Henning, and is \"working diligently to ensure his release,\" the Indianapolis Star reports. Kassig \"was taken hostage while on a humanitarian mission in Syria in October of last year,\" the family says in a statement. \"We ask that you respect our privacy as we work to be able to confirm the identity of our son and daughter, and to keep the Kassig family in our thoughts and prayers.\" Kassig, a 26-year-old former US Army Ranger, \"gave up his life to help others when he returned to the Middle East and around the globe,\" his family says. He was abducted while delivering food and medical supplies to people in Raqqa, the capital of Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime, the New York Times reports. Last week, Kassig posted a video on YouTube in which he said he was \"relieved and grateful\" to have been able to return to the US.",

Days later, the fishermen -- who have since been arrested for facilitating his trip -- say they saw the tribespeople dragging his body around the island. \n \n \"We want to avoid direct confrontation with the tribespeople,\" Dependra Pathak, director general of police of the Andaman and Nicobar islands, told CNN when asked about the latest efforts to retrieve Chau's body. \"We do not want to go there and create an unhappy situation.\" \n \n The decision to avoid a direct confrontation with the isolated tribe came after a series of meetings and reconnaissance trips made by the officials. Anthropologists and tribal experts were also consulted. \n \n By Sunday, authorities had mapped out the area with the help of the fishermen and observed several members of the tribe walking around the area where eyewitnesses claim to have seen Chau's body dragged and buried. \n \n However, despite ruling out any immediate attempts to land on the island, local police would not categorically rule out retrieving the body at a future date. \"We are working on it. We'll firm up a plan very soon,\" said Pathak. \n \n The Sentinelese: World's most isolated tribe \n \n The Sentinelese have lived in complete isolation on the remote North Sentinel Island for tens of thousands of years. The island, which is part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, is roughly as large as Manhattan. \n \n India has protected the island for decades to prevent the Sentinelese from contracting modern illnesses and to keep outsiders safe. \n \n People are not allowed to go within five nautical miles of the island by Indian law and the Indian Navy patrols it day and night. \n \n And while its residents have no contact with the outside world, they aren't too far from other civilizations. \n \n The island is only about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the territory's capital known to tourists for its stunning emerald beaches, history and water sports. \n \n At least 15 Sentinelese could be living on the island, according to India's census estimates from 2011. \n \n John Allen Chau was an avid aventure traveler. \n \n He returned to his boat twice before vanishing \n \n Traveling on a tourist visa, Chau arrived at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October with one mission: preach to the Sentinelese. \n \n Indian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26. \n \n He had traveled to the remote island years ago and returned knowing that his mission was illegal and risky. Still, he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life. He hoped to eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey. \n \n He asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and also recruit others -- several fishermen and a water sports expert -- who could help him. \n \n He carefully planned his expedition and used a 13-page long journal to write his strategy, the steps he would take to reach the island and, later, some of his memories. \n \n After he paid the fishermen around $350, police said, the group boarded \"a wooded boat fitted with motors\" and headed to the island on the night of November 15. \n \n They stopped a little less than half a mile away and waited in the dark. At some point in the morning, Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said. \n \n He returned later that day with arrow injuries, police said. \n \n But that did not discourage him. \n \n He returned to the island the following day. It's unclear what happened but \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe\" and he had no other option than to swim back to the boat. \n \n On the third attempt of his mission, he didn't come back. \n \n The fishermen said they later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around but police haven't been able to independently verify Chau's death. Authorities believe he was killed. \n \n All seven locals who facilitated the trip have been arrested.",

    "document": "Suppose you dug a tunnel through the center of Earth, jumped in, and let gravity pull you through. How long would it take you to reach the other side of the planet? For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. \n \n \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" says David Jackson, a physicist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and editor of the American Journal of Physics, a publication of the American Association of Physics Teachers. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth, he notes. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. \"That's what makes this so much fun to think about,\" Jackson says. \n \n The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. \n \n Here's where the usual unrealistic assumption enters. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from the center. That's because as you descend through the tunnel, the amount of mass at an altitude lower than yours decreases, whereas the mass at an altitude higher than yours no longer has any effect on you\u2014as students calculate using a bit of mathematics called the shell theorem. \n \n Because the force pulling you toward the center is proportional to the distance from the center, you zip back and forth through Earth exactly as a weight on a spring bobs up or down or a pendulum swings back and forth. The gravity tunnel problem is used in teaching precisely because it produces such simple harmonic motion. \n \n In reality, of course, Earth does not have a uniform density, but has a less dense crust and mantle and a more dense core. So Alexander Klotz, a graduate student in physics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, started thinking about what a more realistic analysis would yield. Klotz says he isn't sure why he started mulling over the problem. But he sometimes answers physics questions on the website reddit. \"I've sort of engaged in a bit of educational outreach,\" Klotz says, \"and that [question] comes up quite a lot.\" \n \n To get a more realistic mass distribution for Earth, he relied on the Preliminary Reference Earth Model, which is based on seismic data. It traces Earth's density from about less than 1000 kilograms per cubic meter at the surface to roughly 13,000 kilograms per cubic meter at the center of the core 6371 kilometers below, including a dramatic jump at the edge of the outer core, 3500 kilometers from the center. Solving the problem numerically, Klotz found that an object should fall through Earth in 38 minutes and 11 seconds, instead of the 42 minutes and 12 seconds predicted assuming a uniform planet. \n \n Curiously, Klotz found that he got almost exactly the same answer\u201438 minutes flat\u2014if he simply assumed that the force of gravity remained constant and equal to the value at the surface as an object plummeted toward the center. Such a constant force would require a different density distribution, one that increases steadily as the distance to Earth\u2019s center falls\u2014so that when the distance to the center is halved, the density doubles\u2014and peaks to infinity at the center. (The real distribution simply plateaus in the core, and the force of gravity diminishes to zero at the center of the core.) \n \n So why does the constant-force approximation work so well? Because of the mass distribution in Earth, the force of gravity remains roughly constant\u2014and actually increases slightly\u2014down to the outer core, Klotz explains. From there on in, the force of gravity falls with distance much as in the original problem. But by that point, the object is moving so fast that it actually spends very little time passing through the core, where the constant-force approximation is obviously wrong. So in the end, the approximation is good enough. \n \n It's that surprising explanation that makes the new analysis gratifying, Jackson says. \"The classic problem needs to stay,\" he says. \"But this is a nice addition to the classic problem.\" For his part, Klotz says that, in this day of big science, his experience shows that \"with the right idea it's still possible to make, not a monumental discovery, but an incremental one.\" ||||| Abstract \n \n This paper examines the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of Earth as ascertained from seismic data. Numerically, it is found that the time taken to fall along the diameter is 38 min, compared to 42 min for a planet with uniform density. The time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer independent of distance but interpolates between 42 min for short trips and 38 min for long trips. The brachistochrone path (minimizing the time between any two points) is similar in shape to the uniform-density solution but tends to reach a greater maximum depth and takes less time to traverse.

Credit: NASA (Phys.org)\u2014Alexander Klotz a student at McGill University in Canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question, how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the Earth? Instead of the commonly accepted 42 minutes, he claims it is 38. He has published his reasoning, math and conclusions in a paper published in The American Journal of Physics. \n \n If someone were to drill a hole all the way through the planet, and then somehow manage to fall into it, how long would it take them to arrive on the other side? That is a physics question put to students every year, and those who give it expect the answer to be 42 minutes. But is that answer correct? Klotz says no and has the math to prove it, Science reported. \n \n The accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into account the constantly changing impact that gravity will have (and ignoring drag due to the presence of air) on the person falling, becoming less and less of a factor as the center of the Earth is approached then growing stronger and stronger as the person heads \"up\" against gravity on the other side. It is accepted that the speed attained during the descent on the first half of the journey would be significant enough to cause the person to continue moving against gravity on the other side of the planet, right up until the surface is reached. \n \n But Klotz argues that it is time to start taking the different densities of the Earth's layers into consideration\u2014after all, a lot of research has shown that our planet is a lot denser at the center than at the crust for example\u2014and that of course would have an impact on the person falling through. He has used seismic data to calculate the different densities at different depths and has used that data to give a more accurate answer to the falling man question, stating that it would in fact, take just 38 minutes (and 11 seconds) to fall all the way through, not 42 and (12 seconds). \n \n Interestingly, Klotz also notes that if gravity were to be assumed to be at a surface level constant throughout the duration of the trip, the math shows it would take just 38 minutes as well. \n \n Explore further: Are astronauts really weightless? \n \n More information: The gravity tunnel in a non-uniform Earth, Am.

The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World. \n \n The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) and the IDF thwarted a large, transnational Hamas terrorism network that was preparing to carry out an array of attacks against Israelis, the domestic intelligence agency announced on Thursday. \n \n \n \n In recent weeks, some 30 Hamas members have been arrested in raids led by the IDF\u2019s Duvdevan undercover unit. \n \n \n \n \n \n Two M-16 rifles, ammunition and bomb-making equipment were seized.The network planned to target the Teddy soccer stadium and the light rail system in the capital, to carry out car bombings and kidnappings of Israelis in Judea and Samaria as well as overseas, the Shin Bet said.The nerve center of the network was situated in Hamas\u2019s headquarters in Turkey, the Shin Bet added.Additional intended targets included infiltrations of Israeli communities, shooting and bombing attacks against Israeli traffic and military targets in the West Bank, and setting up terrorist cells in Jordan to carry out cross-border attacks into Israel.The plot, uncovered in September, involved the assembly of multiple terrorist cells in the West Bank, as well as the training of Hamas members overseas.Members of the network planted two bombs in Samaria on August 31. Neither of the attacks, which involved time-detonated explosives, resulted in injuries.The second explosive was timed to kill emergency responders, according to the Shin Bet\u2019s investigation.Following that attack, the agency arrested dozens of suspects, and learned during subsequent interrogations that some had joined Hamas as far back as 2012, in Jordan.\u201cThey received military training, and were given missions. At the start of 2014, they moved in and began taking action. Their missions included meetings with operatives, preparing [terrorist] infrastructure, and gathering intelligence on targets,\u201d the Shin Bet said.In Jordan, the network sought to recruit students who were friends of Hamas operatives.The network identified students who supported the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and had highly developed skills in various areas.Eventually, recruiters turned to selected prospective operatives with formal requests to join Hamas. Those who accepted came under the command of Hamas\u2019s Turkey-based headquarters, which oversaw their military training.They were trained under the supervision of Hamas\u2019s overseas and Gaza-based branches, in Jordan, Turkey, Syria and the Gaza Strip.Recruits reached Gaza through smuggling tunnels from Egypt, and were instructed in weapons, terrain analysis, navigation and how to keep information secret.In Turkey, they learned about various \u201cspheres of operations, aimed at carrying out terrorist attacks within Israel, the West Bank and overseas,\u201d the Shin Bet said.In Jordan, training included weapons handling, bomb-making and briefings ahead of attacks.At the end of their training, recruits joined various terrorist plots, in line with guidance from senior Hamas members in Turkey.Instructions arrived from Hamas commanders in Turkey to field operatives, via \u201cforward operatives in Turkey and Jordan, who were responsible for executing the plans.\u201dSubsequently, Hamas operatives arrived in the West Bank to carry out the attacks, as well as coordinate the smuggling of weapons and money.The operatives received instructions to recruit local terrorist cells and train more operatives, as well as to locate sites for bomb-making labs and apartments that could serve as operations centers.In August, the Shin Bet thwarted an earlier large-scale plot, headed by senior Ramallah- based Hamas commander Riad Nasser, who is under arrest.That plot was also directed by Hamas\u2019s Turkey-based headquarters, specifically by Saleh Aruri, who commands the movement\u2019s \u201cWest Bank sector.\u201dHamas funneled more than NIS 1m. into that network and purchased weapons, before the Shin Bet thwarted the initiative.Both plots \u201cpoint to the high motivation of Hamas, and of Saleh Aruri, who seek to reconstruct Hamas\u2019s military infrastructure in the West Bank, and to carry out attacks against Israeli targets,\u201d the agency said.Such attacks would have enabled Hamas to \u201cmove the spotlight\u201d away from the Gaza Strip, and drag Israel into a harsh response in Judea and Samaria, resulting in the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, which is one of Hamas\u2019s central goals, it said.The Shin Bet named several key suspects under arrest, including Manaf al-Rahman Ajabara, 28, a Jordanian resident, who was recruited to Hamas while studying engineering.During questioning, he told the Shin Bet of how he underwent military training and received mission assignments from Hamas leaders to set up an infrastructure in the West Bank, recruit additional members, and carry out attacks on Israeli targets. He confessed to playing a role in setting up the bomb attacks in Samaria on August 31.Another suspect is Rajai Mustafa Amuri, 30, from Tulkarm. Amuri, who was in prison five previous times for security offenses, confessed to working with a Jordanian Hamas operative to carry out the bomb attacks in the northern West Bank, according to the Shin Bet.The agency named six additional suspects, some from the West Bank and others from Jordan, who allegedly played roles such as bomb-making, funneling funds, and setting up terrorist cells. \n \n Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

There were also plans to carry out attacks and abductions in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, it said. \n \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Shin Bet and Israel Defense Forces \"for foiling very dangerous terrorist actions that could have claimed many victims in our country.\" \n \n While this operation has been made public, many other counter-terror actions against Hamas remain secret, he said, while visiting the Sde Boker kibbutz in southern Israel. \n \n \"We are operating day and night in order to maintain the security of Israel's citizens; the people who do this are deserving of all praise and support,\" he said. \n \n Israel demolishes home as killers' families pay price for terror attacks ||||| Members of a Hamas terror ring in the West Bank, run from the organization\u2019s headquarters in Turkey, sought to carry out an array of major attacks, including on Jerusalem\u2019s main soccer stadium and its light rail line, the Shin Bet security service said Thursday. \n \n The Shin Bet announcement confirmed a Times of Israel report last week that said Israel had arrested dozens of members of a Hamas terror network operating throughout the West Bank. The network, Palestinian officials said, was funded and directed by Hamas officials in Turkey who have set up a de facto command center in the Muslim country. \n \n More than 30 Hamas operatives were arrested during the month of September, the Shin Bet said Thursday. The majority were recruited while studying in Jordan and trained in either Syria or the Gaza Strip, which they entered via tunnels from Sinai. \n \n The Shin Bet said the ring was preparing to kidnap Israelis in Israel and abroad, enter Israeli villages, detonate car bombs, perpetrate roadside attacks, and execute a major terror attack in Teddy Stadium, where the Israeli soccer team Beitar Jerusalem plays its home games. \n \n The Shin Bet asserted that the plan was evidence of an \u201cindefatigable\u201d desire on Hamas\u2019s part to rehabilitate its terror infrastructure in the West Bank and to tug Israel into a sharp military response, which might indirectly lead to the toppling of PA President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s regime, which is \u201cone of Hamas\u2019 goals.\u201d \n \n The network was similar in its operational characteristics to one uncovered in August during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian officials said last week, adding that according to information received from Israel, this terror ring was even larger. Its operatives had already attempted several attacks against Israel, they added, but they had all failed. \n \n As with the previous network, the man behind the terrorist grouping was Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader who was deported from the West Bank to Turkey in 2010, the sources said. \n \n Arouri, they said, built up and funded the network, and has effectively established a Hamas command post in Turkey which is leading terror efforts in the West Bank. Arouri is reportedly aided by dozens of operatives, some of whom were deported by Israel in the wake of the Gilad Shalit prisoner deal in 2011. \n \n The officials accused Turkey as well as Qatar \u2014 the current home of Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal \u2014 of enabling Hamas to operate freely within their territories to carry out attacks against Israel and undermine the Palestinian Authority. \n \n In response to Thursday\u2019s announcement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended the Shin Bet and IDF for thwarting the attack, saying it was only one of multiple covert operations \u201cagainst terrorists, against Hamas, which poses a threat to the existence of the nation state of the Jews and is in essence a threat to the existence of Jews in general.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe act day and night to protect the security of Israeli citizens and the people who are engaged in this work are deserving all praise and support,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \n In August, the Shin Bet said it had arrested over 90 operatives and thwarted a Hamas coup attempt in the West Bank aimed at toppling PA President Mahmoud Abbas and starting a third intifada uprising. \n \n The Palestinian sources, however, maintained that the two networks were more concerned with carrying out attacks against Israeli military and settler targets in the West Bank. A rough Israeli response and the consequent weakening of the PA was a secondary objective, they said. \n \n The officials added that several Hamas operatives connected to the recently uncovered network were also being held in PA detention facilities. \n \n It appeared that the ring announced by the Shin Bet on Thursday began to unravel with a failed roadside attack on August 31, 2014. A series explosive devices that its members allegedly placed near the settlement of Reheilim were set to detonate one after another, in order to kill as many Israelis as possible, including the first responders on the scene. The Shin Bet said that intelligence work done in the wake of that failed attack enabled the organization to arrest the perpetrators and some 30 other suspects, revealing \u201ca wealth of information about the infrastructure.\u201d \n \n The first recruits were chosen already in 2012 while studying in Jordan. The Shin Bet described the process of drafting, training, and organizing the recruits: At first the men were approached based on their religious ideology and individual skills, and, at times, personal acquaintance. Fresh recruits were passed on to headquarters, which decided where they should undergo training. \n \n Abdullah Zitawi, a resident of Jordan, admitted under interrogation that he, for instance, had been inserted into Gaza three times between 2012 and 2013 and underwent weapons and explosives training there before being told, in 2014, to relocate to the West Bank and wait for further orders. Others were trained in Jordan, the Shin Bet said. \n \n Once the operatives were inserted into the West Bank, the Shin Bet added, the Hamas officials in Turkey split them into cells and planned their deployment, with orders coming in to the West Bank via forward operatives in Jordan and Turkey. \n \n The Shin Bet uncovered several safe houses, materials to be used for explosives, two M-16 rifles, and ammunition. \n \n On November 20, the security organization revealed that it had arrested a Hamas cell in the Bethlehem area that sought to buy a rocket-propelled grenade and fire it at Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman, a plan that, if successful, would have sent tremors through the region. \n \n Avi Issacharoff contributed to this report. ||||| JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel's Shin Bet security service said Thursday it had uncovered a vast Hamas network in the West Bank that was planning large-scale attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem. \n \n The Shin Bet said it arrested more than 30 Hamas militants who planned to kidnap Israelis and carry out attacks against Jerusalem's light rail and its largest soccer stadium, among other targets. It said the men were trained and recruited in Jordan and Turkey and that various arms and explosives were recovered. \n \n While the Islamic militant group Hamas rules the Gaza Strip, the West Bank is run by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. \n \n The arrests come amid Israel's worst sustained bout of violence in nearly a decade. Eleven Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks over the past month, including five people who were killed with guns and meat cleavers in a bloody assault on a Jerusalem synagogue last week. Most of the violence has occurred in Jerusalem, along with deadly attacks in Tel Aviv and the West Bank. \n \n Hamas did not immediately comment on the arrests. \n \n Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated the Shin Bet for thwarting the attacks, saying that if carried out they could have exacted a heavy toll of casualties. \n \n \"This is one operation that has been published but there are many more that remain secret,\" he said of Israel's intelligence work. \"These foiling activities are against terrorists and against Hamas, which challenges the existence of a Jewish nation-state and the existence of Jews in general.\"",

But the letters in the name, which form the acronym for an unprintable expression of bafflement, are an appropriate fit for an object that is as mysterious as it is unprecedented. \n \n B. Bolin, R. Jedicke, M. Micheli \n \n Scientists have worked out that WT1190F will plunge to Earth from above the Indian Ocean on 13 November, making it one of the very few space objects whose impact can be accurately predicted. More unusual still, WT1190F was a 'lost' piece of space debris orbiting far beyond the Moon, ignored and unidentified, before being glimpsed by a telescope in early October. \n \n An observing campaign is now taking shape to follow the object as it dives through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, says Gerhard Drolshagen, co-manager in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, of the European Space Agency\u2019s near-Earth objects office. The event not only offers a scientific opportunity to watch something plunge through the atmosphere, but also tests the plans that astronomers have put in place to coordinate their efforts when a potentially dangerous space object shows up. \u201cWhat we planned to do seems to work,\u201d Drolshagen says. \u201cBut it\u2019s still three weeks to go.\u201d \n \n WT1190F was detected by the Catalina Sky Survey, a programme based at the University of Arizona, Tucson, aimed at discovering asteroids and comets that swing close to Earth. At first, scientists didn\u2019t know what to make of this weird body. But they quickly computed its trajectory after collecting further observations and unearthing 2012 and 2013 sightings from telescope archives, says independent astronomy-software developer Bill Gray, who has been tracking the debris with astronomers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \n \n WT1190F travels a highly elliptical orbit, swinging out twice as far as the Earth\u2013Moon distance, Gray says. Gray\u2019s calculations show that it will hit Earth at 6:20 utc, hitting the ocean about 65 kilometres off the southern tip of Sri Lanka. Much, if not all, of it will burn up in the atmosphere, but \u201cI would not necessarily want to be going fishing directly underneath it\u201d, Gray says. \n \n The object is only 1 to 2 metres in size, and its trajectory shows that it has a low density, and is perhaps hollow. That suggests an artificial object, \u201ca lost piece of space history that\u2019s come back to haunt us\u201d, says Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It could be a spent rocket stage or panelling shed by a recent Moon mission. It is also possible that the debris dates back decades, perhaps even to the Apollo era. An object seen orbiting Earth in 2002 was eventually identified as a discarded segment of the Saturn V rocket that launched the second mission to land men on the Moon. \n \n WT1190F is a rare breed of space object. Researchers are currently tracking only 20 or so artificial objects in distant orbits, says Gareth Williams, an astronomer at the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There are probably many more such pieces of space junk in orbit around the Earth\u2013Moon system, but it is impossible to say how many. No others are known to have made the return trip to Earth, although it is likely that some have done so without anyone noticing, McDowell says. \n \n Drolshagen plans to get spectral information on the object, which may help to identify it, and he hopes to coordinate impact observations conducted onboard ships or aeroplanes. But that may be the end of the concerted effort to study this class of object. Unlike near-Earth asteroids, space debris that flies well away from Earth has not commanded significant amounts of funding or attention. And the US military, which tracks space debris, says that it lacks the ability to identify WT1190F or to predict its path. \n \n \u201cThere is no official, funded effort to do tracking of deep-Earth orbits the way we track low-Earth orbit,\u201d McDowell says. \u201cI think that has to change\u201d.",

(CBS4) \u2013 There\u2019s a sad story in Elbert County after a wildlife sanctuary euthanized all of its animals \u2014 a total of 11 animals \u2014 lions, tigers, and bears. \n \n The Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary in Agate said killing the animals was the only option after county commissioners denied it\u2019s request to relocate. \n \n Jim Hansen has lived near the sanctuary for many years. He was sad to hear that that the animals, which went there for safekeeping and care, were euthanized. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of disheartening,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time I don\u2019t know exactly what kind of problems they are facing down there.\u201d \n \n In a statement to CBS4, the sanctuary owners said ongoing flooding and damage prevented them from continuing their operations and caring for the animals at the present location. They wanted to move the sanctuary to another location, land also in Elbert County, and owned by them. \n \n Elbert County commissioners denied that request. Commissioner Danny Wilcox told CBS4\u2019s Jennifer Brice by phone it was denied it because of numerous safety concerns with the proposed move, and the sanctuary would go from a remote area to a more densely populated place. \n \n Dr. Joan Laub, a sanctuary owner, said she is devastated about the loss of the animals. She said they thought about relocating the animals. She added that the animals \u201cwould not have survived a move to a new facility\u201d because they were all seniors, some with disabilities. \n \n Laub added that they had a safety problem with a permanent solution for the animals. In an email she told Brice, \u201cMultiple governing bodies signed off on the relocation. They based their decision on the law. The three county commissioners denied the permit based upon emotions and their self-serving agenda, i.e., votes.\u201d \n \n In a statement emailed Wednesday evening, the Elbert County Commissioners described themselves as shocked and saddened by the news: \u201cThe decision by the operators of Lion\u2019s Gate to euthanize all their animals comes as a total surprise to the County for two reasons. Only two weeks earlier, the operators of the facility assured the County in a public forum that if the application was denied, they would continue to operate at their current location as they had for the previous 10 years. Additionally, the Keenesburg Wildlife Sanctuary publicly offered to care for the animals at their facility if Lion\u2019s Gate was unable to do so.\u201d \n \n Wilcox said he did not know the outcome of this would result in the animals being euthanized. He said he specifically asked the owners what their plan would be if the approval was denied. He said he was told that the sanctuary owners would continue operate as-is based on the ages of the animals. \n \n Additional Resources \n \n Click here to read the full statement from Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary and read the full statement from below from Elbert County commissioners on the matter: \n \n Elbert County Commissioners were saddened to learn of the decision made by the owners of Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary to euthanize their eleven animals. \n \n After a lengthy public hearing on April 12th, the County denied the special use application to relocate several lions, tigers and bears to a substantially more populated and developed area. This decision was based on concerns that the proposed plan for relocation of these animals was not adequately resourced, nor were exigency plans clearly defined which would ensure the safety of the animals and the surrounding residents. \n \n The decision by the operators of Lion\u2019s Gate to euthanize all their animals comes as a total surprise to the County for two reasons. Only two weeks earlier, the operators of the facility assured the County in a public forum that if the application was denied, they would continue to operate at their current location as they had for the previous 10 years. Additionally, the Keenesburg Wildlife Sanctuary publicly offered to care for the animals at their facility if Lion\u2019s Gate was unable to do so. Given these facts, the news that Lion\u2019s Gate euthanized all 11 animals at the same time and so shortly after the decision to deny the move comes as a shock. \n \n \u201cThe most important consideration in this land use issue was ensuring the safety of the many citizens residing in the vicinity of the proposed relocation site.

Turned away, Fishman instead exhibited the cat at the County Seat bar in Kiowa, according to state wildlife records. \n \n When authorities investigated eight days later, Winney and Fishman could not produce a license for two lions and two tigers they were keeping at another sanctuary. \n \n Winney said the cats were never his, and the district attorney\u2019s office dismissed the case. Fishman has since left the state and could not be located for comment. \n \n In November 2001, Winney fetched two sick lion cubs from a faltering sanctuary in South Dakota and brought them to a refuge near Colorado Springs for life-saving care. \n \n Winney said Monday that he thought he had obtained the clearances he needed from local and federal officials in South Dakota, and his conviction was the result of a poor legal defense. \n \n After exhausting his appeals, Winney lost his wildlife license. It was suspended for one year, until November. \n \n In May 2002, Winney and Fishman brought two tigers to a party at Laub\u2019s home in Parker. \n \n One tiger allegedly pinned down a 2-year-old child, and Winney was charged with failing to have a license for the tigers. State records are unclear about details of the incident, but Winney said no one was ever in danger. He was acquitted by a jury. \n \n \u201cOh well, I\u2019m sure I will have another opportunity in the future,\u201d district wildlife manager Gene Abram wrote in a 2003 e-mail to colleagues after Winney\u2019s acquittal. \n \n Holeman said Winney\u2019s record would not be a factor in any future application for the Elbert County sanctuary. \n \n \u201cWe consider each application on its merits,\u201d he said. \n \n Winney has touted his experience as an animal trainer in his qualifications to oversee the proposed sanctuary, including two years as \u201csole handler\u201d for Siegfried & Roy in Las Vegas. \n \n A spokeswoman for Siegfried & Roy characterized Winney\u2019s role with the showmen as in a \u201cjunior capacity.\u201d \n \n Winney is \u201cnot an expert, if that\u2019s the impression,\u201d said spokeswoman Kala Peterson. \n \n Winney said Peterson\u2019s characterization is inaccurate and just part of Siegfried & Roy\u2019s effort to present themselves as the sole experts in their act. \n \n \u201cIn the cat world when you join the family, you\u2019re in the family, but when you leave you\u2019re no longer part of the family,\u201d he said. \n \n Staff writer Joey Bunch can be reached at 303-820-1174 or jbunch@denverpost.com. ||||| A Colorado community is in shock after an animal sanctuary battling housing problems resorted to euthanizing all 11 of its exotic animals, despite the county planning commission claiming other facilities had offered to take them in. \n \n Lion\u2019s Gate Animal Sanctuary in Agate announced in a statement last week that it had euthanized five bears, three lions and three tigers. The statement blamed the deaths on the Elbert County\u2019s planning commission for refusing the sanctuary\u2019s request to move to another site because of flooding. \n \n \u201cThe flooding and resulting damage prevents us from reasonably continuing our operation and caring for our animals safely,\u201d the organization had said in an earlier online petition for their move. \n \n Facility owners Peter Winney and Joan Laub reasoned in their statement last week that they wouldn\u2019t have had to euthanize the animals if the local government officials had not denied their request to move. They identified the animals killed as \u201cVictims of Elbert County Commissioners.\u201d \n \n (Story continues below slideshow.) \n \n BEFORE YOU GO PHOTO GALLERY Animal Sanctuary Euthanizes Lions, Tigers And Bears After Flooding Concerns \n \n County Chairman Danny Wilcox, who was one of the three voting commissioners, said the new location the group chose was in a more urban and populated area, making the conditions unsafe for the general public. The animal sanctuary also never told the commissioners that they\u2019d resort to killing the animals, he said. \n \n \u201cWe were shocked,\u201d he told HuffPost on Thursday of the sanctuary\u2019s actions, which he said have resulted in people threatening him, the other commissioners and even his grandchildren. \n \n Jennifer Churchill, a spokeswoman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, described the sanctuary\u2019s decision as unprecedented. \n \n \u201cThis has never happened before in our state,\u201d she told HuffPost. \n \n Wilcox said the board pointedly asked the owners what would happen to the animals if their request to move was denied, and they said they\u2019d \u201ccontinue to operate as they had for the last 10 years.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey believe that we made them euthanize the animals. That\u2019s the story that\u2019s evidently being told and we did not do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, we verified that the animals would continue to live.\u201d \n \n He added that two sanctuaries, which he declined to identify, contacted the county and offered to take in the animals if they could not be moved. \n \n But in a press release, the county identified one of those facilities as the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Kennesburg, about 70 miles north of Lion\u2019s Gate. \n \n John Moore via Getty Images The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Kennsburg, Colorado, said it would have taken in the animals if asked. \n \n Pat Craig, who runs that sanctuary, said they \u201ccould have easily taken them.\u201d \n \n \u201cEleven is pretty small,\u201d he told HuffPost Wednesday of the number of bears, tigers and lions that needed homes. \u201cThey could have easily called.\u201d \n \n Craig\u2019s 720-acre facility, whose website boasts that it hosts more than 400 animals, including tigers, bears, lions, leopards and wolves, it has taken in from around the world. \n \n In February, the group took in five big cats and two bears from a zoo in Argentina. Craig said they also recently received 27 animals from South Dakota. \n \n An attempt to reach the Lion\u2019s Gate owners for comment was not successful. \n \n A statement published to Lion\u2019s Gate\u2019s Facebook page on Thursday argued that the animals could not be moved because they were \u201ctoo old and many had disabilities and special needs.\u201d The sanctuary denied that they resorted to killing the animals because of the county commissioners, even though they had previously described the animals as the county\u2019s victims. \n \n Instead, they said they euthanized the animals because they were old and \u201cmany had disabilities and special needs\u201d that prevented them from being moved. It was no longer safe for the animals or for the public for them to be at their current location, they wrote. \n \n Cathy Bosier, who said she has volunteered at Lion\u2019s Gate Sanctuary for the last year and a half, said the owners are no longer talking to the media, but described them as devastated by the animals\u2019 deaths, which she called a \u201clast resort.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey felt their hands were forced. They were backed into a corner and their hands were forced,\u201d she told HuffPost on Wednesday. \u201cEverything else was tried and this was the last thing.\u201d \n \n Asked if the commissioners knew that euthanasia was their last resort, she answered: \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d \n \n Bosier said the facility reached out to a neighboring sanctuary for help but the animals\u2019 old age prevented their move. She described the animals as around 20 years of age. \n \n \u201cThe move to a larger sanctuary would have killed them,\u201d she said. \n \n David Mercado / Reuters This lion named Kiara was relocated to The Wild Animal Sanctuary park in 2011. She was one of 25 lions that were rescued from traveling circuses in Bolivia. \n \n Addressing Craig\u2019s facility, she said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re equipped to care for these animals with special needs.\u201d \n \n Craig denied this claim. \n \n \u201cWe locate older animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe age has no factor.\u201d \n \n Craig suggested that the reasons behind the animals\u2019 euthanasia are deeper than they appear. \n \n A 2006 report by the Denver Post highlighted Winney\u2019s previous legal trouble involving wild animals, including \u201callegations of smuggling cats\u201d and other documentation and licensing issues. Craig said the owners\u2019 inability to get additional licenses for their sanctuary prohibited them from acquiring additional means of funding. \n \n \u201cIt severely restricted what they could do,\u201d he said. \n \n Bloomberg via Getty Images The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colorado, boasts 720 acres and hundreds of animals. \n \n Wilcox, the county chairman, noted that this was the second time the facility had requested this move. The previous one, in 2006, was also denied. \n \n This time around, Wilcox said, the owners cited flooding issues as a way to be considered for a special-use permit. He called the flooding concerns \u201cquestionable,\u201d however. \n \n \u201cWe went out to look at the site prior to the hearing. We went out and looked at all the issues surrounding it, looked at the fencing, looked at the topography,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research that we did brought up a lot of issues and concerns.\u201d \n \n According to the Denver Post, residents around the current location had complained for years about safety and noise issues related to the facility. \n \n One neighbor told local Denver station ABC 7 that when the lions roared the whole ground shook. ||||| Lion\u2019s Gate wild animal sanctuary has euthanized all 11 of its animals, its hand forced when the Elbert County commissioners denied the refuge\u2019s request to move, co-owner Joan Laub said. \n \n Laub told KMGH-Channel 7 that the animals had to be euthanized because recurring flooding on the property made conditions unsafe. \n \n The sanctuary euthanized three lions, three tigers and five bears on April 20, according to KUSA-Channel 9. \n \n On April 12, Elbert County commissioners unanimously voted to deny the sanctuary\u2019s request to move from eastern Elbert County to a location near Elizabeth, the Denver Post reported. \n \n Commissioner Grant Thayer said the unanimous vote to deny the sanctuary a special-use permit was made because \u201cit was felt that the community impact would be best served if it was denied.\u201d \n \n It was the second time the board of commissioners voted against a move for the facility, with a previous board turning down a similar request by Lion\u2019s Gate in 2006. \n \n For years, neighbors living near the proposed relocation site had said it was not appropriate for a rural neighborhood mostly known for an equine lifestyle. They worried about safety and complained about the possibility of lions roaring at all times of day and night. \n \n Lion\u2019s Gate owners, Laub and Peter Winney, argued at a planning commission meeting in March that the animals were elderly and posed little security risk. As for noise, Laub said the sanctuary\u2019s two male lions might roar once a day for only seconds at a time. \n \n The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department told Denver7 officials were aware of the mass euthanasia and the burial of all 11 animals on the sanctuary grounds. But it said no regulations were violated. \n \n Pat Craig, the founder and executive director of the Wildlife Sanctuary in Keenesburg, which is the state\u2019s largest with 450 animals, told Denver7 he was surprised the sanctuary\u2019s owners didn\u2019t try to find new homes for the animals. \n \n \u201cIn this specific case with Lion\u2019s Gate, they have so few animals, they would easily be able to place every animal with another wildlife sanctuary,\u201d Craig said.\u201d \u201cI can guarantee you that a lot of organizations would be glad to help.\u201d",

On April 12, after the owners of the Lion's Gate wild animal sanctuary requested to move to a nearby but more urban location citing safety concerns after recurring flooding on the property, Elbert County commissioners voted no, citing safety concerns, reports the Denver Post.

On a Care2 Petition page launched months ago, Laub wrote that Colorado Parks and Wildlife had authorized a move to 85 acres the sanctuary also owns in a more urban part of the county, though she listed 18 animals at the time. County Chairman Danny Wilcox, meanwhile, tells Huffington Post that the commission is \"shocked\" the animals were put down after the owners had said they'd continue to operate if their request was denied. A spokeswoman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife calls the killings unprecedented: \"This has never happened before in our state.\" One of the owners was once accused of smuggling cats, per the Denver Post in 2006, and the owner of the larger sanctuary theorizes to the Huffington Post that issues with licensing made it difficult for Lion's Gate to get funding.

The 91-year-old Woodstock father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather owned four separate gasoline stations in Woodstock over the past 50 years and always admired race car driving from afar. \n \n In addition to his passion for automobiles, Thomas has always had one nagging thought on his mind over the years \u2014 one nonconventional wish on his bucket list. On Sunday, Thomas\u2019 three grandchildren helped him check that item off his list. \n \n \u201c[My grandfather] told me a long time ago that he always wanted to back a car through the garage door,\u201d said granddaughter Becky Goers, of Woodstock. \u201cHe always wondered if the garage door would pop off, or if the frame would come down with it.\u201d \n \n Goers, a physical education and driver\u2019s education teacher at Woodstock High School, recently shared her grandfather\u2019s dream with her brother, Andrew Thomas, a deputy for the McHenry County Sheriff\u2019s Office who happens to work as an accident reconstruction officer. Andrew Thomas wanted make his grandfather\u2019s dream a reality. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s been on his bucket list, and it\u2019s been on the back of my mind,\u201d Andrew Thomas said. \n \n Andrew Thomas located an old car headed to the junk yard - a 1998 Isuzu Rodeo donated by Midas Touch of Woodstock owner Jeff McGrath - to use for the stunt. And in a fortunate twist of fate, Andrew\u2019s brother Brian Thomas found the perfect garage for the setting. Brian Thomas\u2019 friends, Nick and Jamielynn Wedoff, were planning to demolish their one-car garage, built in 1921, soon to make way for a new two-story addition at their Hill Street home. The couple quickly jumped into the plot. \n \n \u201cGrandpa and Grandma Thomas have always treated us like family and this is something we thought would be fun,\u201d Jamielynn Wedoff said. \n \n And so with a small crowd of family and friends watching \u2014 including his wife of 70 years, Dorothy - Walter Thomas donned a race car driver\u2019s helmet for safety and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat of the Isuzu this past Sunday afternoon. Andrew Thomas, also wearing a helmet for protection, climbed into the passenger seat. \n \n On the \u201cgo\u201d signal, Walter Thomas hit the gas pedal, and the sound of screeching tires preceded the moment when the maroon Isuzu burst through the wooden garage doors. \n \n Although the noise and subsequent crash caused one of Thomas\u2019 great-granddaughters to burst into tears, the rest of the family applauded and cheered. Shattered chunks of wood littered the driveway. For the record, only the garage door came down. The door frame remained unscathed. \n \n \u201cThat was crazy,\u201d a smiling Walter Thomas said, as the car came to a stop. \u201cWe really took the door down.\u201d \n \n Walter Thomas credited his grandchildren for making his dream \u2014 however small \u2014 come true. \n \n \u201cI appreciate the kids getting together.

    "document": "Pete Evans' co-authored paleo diet cookbook for babies under investigation \n \n Updated \n \n A cookbook that recommends feeding infants bone broth as a baby formula is being investigated by the Federal Health Department and leading health groups say some of the book's recipes are potentially risky for babies. \n \n The controversial paleo cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way For New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, was due to be released this week, but the publishers have had to put it on hold. \n \n It was co-authored by Australian chef Pete Evans, nutritionist Helen Padarin and blogger Charlotte Carr. \n \n Publisher Pan Macmillan Australia said the book had not been recalled, simply delayed for release. It would not comment further, and neither would the authors. \n \n What is the Paleo or Stone Age diet? The Paleo diet is based on the idea that we should eat what we did when humans were hunter gatherers. \n \n \n \n Foods included are lean meat, vegetables, fruit, eggs, and seafood. Those on a Paleo diet are encouraged to exclude grains, legumes, dairy products, refined sugar, salt and processed foods. \n \n \n \n Although the Paleolithic or Stone Age diet first appeared in the 1970s, it has received renewed interest over the past few years. \n \n \n \n It is claimed the diet reduces body weight and helps prevent conditions such as diabetes, high blood cholesterol, stroke, osteoporosis and inflammatory disease. \n \n \n \n Most dietitians don't recommend the diet because it encourages high meat consumption, which has been linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, and because it encourages people to cut out whole food groups (grains and dairy). Source: ABC Health and Wellbeing \n \n Evans is a longtime advocate of the paleo diet, as is Carr. Her website said paleo healed what she wrote was her young son's \"compromised immune system, reverse toxicity and illness\". \n \n One of her recipes for a \"homemade formula\" for infants up to six months of age is called the \"Baby Building Broth\". It is made using chicken bones, chicken feet and apple cider vinegar. \n \n Professor Heather Yeatman from the Public Health Association said some of the recipes were potentially dangerous for infants. \n \n \"There appears to be recommendations not to use either breast milk or an approved infant formula, but to provide other foods to infants under six months of age and that really is a big health risk,\" Professor Yeatman said. \n \n \"There's been discussion about a beef broth with mashed up liver as part of a recipe. Now something like that might be appropriate for an older child, but under six months of age, really the best option [is] breast milk.\" \n \n Rebecca Naylor from the Australian Breastfeeding Association said parents should follow tested feeding guidelines for their children. \n \n \"All of the experts that you will speak to would say that feeding your baby anything other than infant formula or breast milk under six months as their primary source of nutrition is extremely dangerous,\" Ms Naylor said. \n \n The Federal Health Department said it is \"aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula\". \n \n It said it would \"continue to investigate\". \n \n For personal trainer Drew Slater and his brother Ben, becoming paleo has transformed their lives for the better. \n \n \"It's a reasonably low carbohydrate diet and moderate fats and high protein for those who understand macros, but it's really just a real food diet,\" Mr Slater said. \n \n They are standing by the paleo lifestyle. \n \n \"I don't believe in knocking something until you've tried it and my brother and I have tried a lot of different diets and fads and we really believe that this is the best solution for us,\" he said. \n \n Mr Slater does not have children, but he said if he did, he would put them on a paleo diet. \n \n \"Kids these days are eating such high processed sugars and heavily refined carbohydrates,\" he said. \n \n \"It's really bad for their intestinal health and I think it's forming bad habits. My kids will definitely be eating a bone broth. I like to start my mornings with a bone broth.\" \n \n Topics: diet-and-nutrition, health, babies, community-and-society, australia \n \n First posted ||||| Off the table: Publisher dumps Pete Evans' baby and toddler cookbook. Photo: Supplied \n \n The publication of a paleo baby cookbook, co-authored by celebrity chef Pete Evans, has been delayed, amid calls by leading health officials that its recipes could be potentially fatal to children. \n \n Friday's release of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way has been postponed by publishers Pan Macmillan after concerns about the book's \"bone broth\" baby formula were raised with the federal Department of Health, The Australian Women's Weekly reported online. \n \n Pete Evans will self-publish his paleo book for children after Pan Macmillan pulled out of its publication. Photo: Supplied \n \n The recipe, called the \"DIY baby milk formula\", is a chicken liver based concoction containing no milk products, which the book claims \"mimics the nutrient profile of breast milk\". The recipe is marketed as a \"wonderful alternative\" to breast milk and the \"next best thing\" when breast milk is not an option. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The claim has been slammed as \"false and misleading\" by Julie Smith, a health and economics expert at the Australian National University. \n \n \"I think the ACCC should be looking very hard at this particular claim. The commercial publisher aims to make money out of this book and I suspect they would have to consider very carefully the investigation that would ensue if they published it.\" \n \n Dr Smith said evidence backed by the World Health Organisation clearly showed that expressed breast milk was the \"next best thing\" for the baby when breast-feeding was not an option. Failing that, commercial baby formula should be used, she said. \n \n The DIY formula recipe potentially exposed babies to dangerous levels of vitamin A and inadequate levels of other nutrients, The Australian Women's Weekly reported. \n \n Michael Moore, chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, said his organisation was among a consortium of health groups that had approached the book's publishers with their concerns. \n \n \"We hope they will look at the evidence instead of putting babies at risk,\" he said. \n \n Mr Moore echoed the concerns raised by the Public Health Association's president, Professor Heather Yeatman, who said in an interview with The Australian Women's Weekly \"there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead\". \n \n \"Especially if [the DIY formula] was the only food a parent was feeding their infant, it's a very real risk. And [I consider that] the baby's growth and development could be impaired.\" \n \n Adherents of the paleo diet restrict their food intake to the types of unprocessed foods presumed to have been eaten by early humans, such as meat, fish, vegetables and fruit. \n \n Milk products, along with all grains and pulses, are banned. \n \n A spokeswoman for federal Health Minister Sussan Ley confirmed the department \"has been closely scrutinising this diet and book\". \n \n \"The department is concerned about the inadequate nutritional values of some of the foods, in particular for infants, and is investigating further,\" a spokeswoman said. \n \n Co-authored by My Kitchen Rules judge and paleo advocate Evans, actress and baby food blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin, the book features a range of other recipes based on the paleo diet that health officials have deemed unsafe or inappropriate for children. Among them are recipes that include runny eggs and added salt, which health experts claim contravene national health guidelines for babies. \n \n Professor Yeatman said children \"may be seriously affected\" as a result of parents limiting their diets to the ascribed paleo doctrine. \n \n \"That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding.\" \n \n The book includes a disclaimer that states: \"Although we in good faith believe that the information provided will help you live a healthier life, relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.\" \n \n When contacted by Fairfax Media, Pan Macmillian would not confirm whether a revised publication date had been set or whether bookstores offering pre-ordered copies of the book had been advised to cease doing so. \n \n On Thursday, Evans' The Paleo Way official website had crashed or had been taken down. \n \n Evans, who has acquired the moniker \"Paleo Pete\", has encountered numerous controversies in his religious promotion and defence of the diet. \n \n Last year, he launched a broadside attack on his Facebook page against the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) over the merits of the paleo diet and urged his half a million Facebook followers to sign a petition to \"boycott\" the Heart Foundation's tick. \n \n In December, he was photographed wearing a \"Fluoride Free\" T-shirt, after reportedly attending a meeting with the controversial Perth-based anti-fluoride group. ||||| A Paleo diet baby cookbook co-authored by celebrity chef Pete Evans has been put on hold after public health officials warned its recipes could potentially result in infants dying. \n \n The Weekly online has learned publishers Pan Macmillan have held back release of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way \u2013 following intervention by a consortium of health organisations that expressed grave concerns over the book's DIY baby milk formula, based on liver and bone broth. \n \n \"In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,\" Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the Public Health Association of Australia, has told The Weekly online. \n \n \"Especially if [the DIY formula] was the only food a parent was feeding their infant, it's a very real risk. And [I consider that] the baby\u2019s growth and development could be impaired.\" \n \n So grave are health officials' fears over the potential health ramifications of the DIY formula that the Federal Government's Department of Health has been alerted to it. \n \n Experts warn it contains more than ten times the safe maximum daily intake of vitamin A for babies and inadequate levels of other nutrients. \n \n \"The Department of Health has been closely scrutinizing this diet and book,\" a spokeswoman said. \n \n The department is \"concerned about the inadequate nutritional values of some of the foods, in particular for infants, and is investigating further.\" \n \n The cookbook is co-authored by influential Channel 7 My Kitchen Rules judge and Paleo advocate Pete Evans, baby recipe blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. None have medical qualifications. \n \n The book was due to be published by Pan MacMillan this Friday (March 13). \n \n But health officials claim that it would be negligent of the publishers to release the book, which they say also flouts national health guidelines by including runny eggs and added salt in recipes for young babies. \n \n They are concerned that celebrity endorsement may give the DIY baby formula extra credibility in the eyes of new mums. \n \n Pan MacMillan stands to take a big financial hit if the book is pulped. Pete Evans is currently one of its best-selling authors, with previous titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day reaching number one in the Australian book charts. \n \n Under the Paleo diet, all grains, dairy and pulses are banned. While adults can choose to follow such a diet, Prof Yeatman says it isn't fair to subject a baby to what she characterises as an unproven set of beliefs. \n \n \"That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding,\" she says. \"If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected.\" \n \n Paleo advocate Pete Evans has more than 780,000 Likes on his Facebook page, which includes many personal testimonials from fans. He describes his current national speaking tour as \"spreading the medicine\". \n \n In his foreword to the book, he implies that the Paleo diet may help prevent autism, birth defects, behavioural disorders, digestive disorders, rashes and asthma. \n \n According to the World Health Organisation, the only safe alternative to breast milk for young babies is commercial formula. \n \n Health officials warn the recipe for baby bone broth formula, which also includes oils and a probiotic supplement, could potentiallycause a vitamin A overdose in infants, the symptoms of which include loss of appetite, dry skin, hair loss, bone pain, fissures in the corners of the mouth and failure to thrive. \n \n A disclaimer in the back of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way states, \"Although we in good faith believe that the information provided will help you live a healthier life, relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.\" \n \n Co-author Charlotte Carr used the DIY baby milk formula recipe on recommendation of a naturopath with her own son in response to his health problems, including sensory processing issues and a compromised gut and immune system. She didn't want to use commercial formula because of worries about ingredients. \n \n Comment is being sought from Pan Macmillan and the book's authors. \n \n *To read our full investigation into Pete Evans\u2019s transformation from celebrity pizza chef to Paleo warrior, see the current March issue of The Weekly on stands now. \n \n Related: \n \n Health bodies warn Paleo is not a cure \n \n The questions Pete Evans refused to answer",

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports the Federal Health Department is \"aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula.\" The recipes in the book, which was co-authored by Australian chef Pete Evans, nutritionist Helen Padarin, and blogger Charlotte Carr, include \"Baby Building Broth\"\u2014made with chicken bones, chicken feet, and apple cider vinegar\u2014for babies up to six months old, and \"Beef broth with mashed up liver as part of a recipe,\" according to the ABC. A spokesperson for the Public Health Association of Australia tells the ABC \"there appears to be recommendations not to use either breast milk or an approved infant formula, but to provide other foods to infants under six months of age and that really is a big health risk. ... All of the experts that you will speak to would say that feeding your baby anything other than infant formula or breast milk under 6 months as their primary source of nutrition is extremely dangerous.\" The Australian Breastfeeding \u2013 Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, a cookbook co-authored by celebrity chef Pete Evans that was supposed to be released Friday in Australia, has been postponed after the country's Department of Health raised concerns about one recipe in particular, the Australian Women's Weekly reports. The recipe in question is \"bone broth\" baby formula, which the book claims \"mimics the nutrient profile of breast milk\" and is a \"wonderful alternative\" to breast milk when it's not possible to breastfeed. But health experts say it could be harmful to babies. \"Especially if was the only food a parent was feeding their infant,\" the president of the Public Health Association of Australia says, \"it's a very real risk. And the baby's growth and development could be impaired.\" Other recipes in the book include runny eggs and added salt, which experts say violate national health guidelines for babies, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. \"The book includes a disclaimer that states: 'Although we in good faith believe that the information provided will help you live a healthier life, relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' The department is concerned about the inadequate nutritional values of some of the foods, \u2013 An Australian author's book touting the health benefits of the paleo diet has been pulled from shelves\u2014and his infant son is among those to blame, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The book, The Paleo Way, was written by Pete Evans and published last month. But now publisher Pan Macmillian has pulled the book from shelves and refunded pre-orders, citing \"a range of consumer concerns,\" the Guardian reports. According to the book's website, paleo is a \"science-based, natural way of living\" that \"helps you live a healthier life.\" But a professor at the University of New South Wales who reviewed the book says children \"may be seriously affected\" if their parents follow the diet. \"That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding,\" the professor says. Evans, who claims to have more than a million Facebook followers, has come under fire in the past for his support of the diet and for wearing a Fluoride Free T-shirt during a meeting with an anti-fluoride group. \u2013 Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, an Australian baby cookbook co-authored by paleo advocate and celebrity chef Pete Evans, has been put on hold after a coalition of health groups warned it could cause infants to die. The book's recipe for DIY baby milk formula, based on liver and bone broth, contains more than 10 times the safe maximum daily intake of vitamin A and inadequate levels of other nutrients. The Department of Health has been \"closely scrutinizing this diet and book,\" a spokesperson says, and is \"concerned about the inadequate nutritional values of some of the foods, in particular for infants.\" Under the Paleo diet, all grains, dairy, and pulses are banned; the recipe for baby bone broth formula also adds salt. \"That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding,\" the president of the Public Health Association of Australia tells the Weekly. \"If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected.\" Evans, who is one of the best-selling authors of Australian book titles including Family Food and Healthy Every Day, calls his current national speaking tour \"spreading the medicine.\"",

The shooting, however, was captured on video and led authorities to pursue the charges against the student. \n \n There was a bit of confusion on police radios at first with reports of an active shooter. An officer then clarified the situation. \"Listen. We've had an accidental shooting, not an active shooter. We have the gun, we have the one who had the gun. We just need two paramedic vehicles to get these two kids out.\" \n \n The shooting happened at 3:45 p.m. Arrington was given CPR at the scene and en route to UAB Hospital but was pronounced dead upon arrival at 4:16 p.m.. The other teen suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the leg. He was treated in the emergency room and quickly released into police custody where he was questioned and held overnight in the Birmingham City Jail. \n \n A woman at the police station who said she was the boy's mother, said she had not been told his condition, but she did not believe he had a gun. She and other family members gathered there declined further comment. Friends of the student said he had been robbed on campus the previous day, and that likely is why he had a gun at school. \n \n Arrington was going to graduate in May, had already been accepted into college and had dreams to become a nurse. \"We're not just talking about some person, we're talking about losing a part of our future,'' said Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. \"Our hearts are heavy.\" \n \n On Thursday, the mayor asked that all flags at city facilities be flown at half-staff. \"My thoughts and prayers remain with this young lady's family, friends, Huffman family, and community,'' he said via Twitter. \n \n School officials announced late Wednesday night that school will be closed on Thursday. The delay will provide an opportunity for the system to conduct a thorough safety sweep of the school, and also allow the system to collaborate with organizations in the community to provide counseling support to both students and staff, said Superintendent Lisa Herring. \n \n \"The magnitude of this event causes us to pause,\" Herring said. \"However, we want to assure our parents, students, staff and community that safety and security are a top priority for Birmingham City Schools.\" \n \n On Thursday, Herring met with Acting Police Chief Orlando Wilson and his staff to come up with a safety plan for heightened security when students return to school on Friday. In addition to the school resource officers already assigned to the school, additional officers will patrol both the inside and outside of the school. A number of other undisclosed safety measures also will be put into place, she said. \n \n The superintendent also said school district administrators are meeting with United Way, area pastors, local teacher association representatives, mental health counselors and others to devise a counseling plan for students and staff. \n \n \"We recognize that as the students return on Friday, that will not be an instructional day,'' Herring said. \"We recognize that this is a time of crisis and students are processing emotions that many have never dealt with. It is important to understand that Friday, and the coming days, will be a day of comfort and support.\" \n \n Many have questioned the use of metal detectors at the school, and whether they were in use Wednesday. Herring said she wouldn't comment on any part of the ongoing investigation, but said there are working metal detectors at the school. \n \n Herring said she knows there are many tough days and tough questions ahead. \n \n \"Our goal is to reassure our parents that, as much as we can, we will work to keep our schools safe. But our hearts and our minds are on the families tonight,'' she said. \"How do we tell parents that their school is safe after an event like this and how do we reassure our children? That is the work we will take on every single day.\" \n \n Herring said Huffman High School does have working metal detectors in use but declined to comment further as it is part of the ongoing investigation. In addition to increased security at the school Thursday, the superintendent said said there will be a full crisis team on hand to help students and faculty. \n \n She praised the school officials on hand during Wednesday's shooting. \"For as much as they've had to tackle on a very difficult day, they have done an exceptional job of trying to provide care and concern for those who were in the building and for those who had exited out,'' she said. \n \n \"We had two victims today, regardless of the circumstances,'' Herring said of both students. \"We are most concerned about our families and the child who is no longer with us. We will not only pledge every effort to support the family, but we will do that for every child in Birmingham City Schools.\" \n \n \"I think it's really important we find a way to mourn with the family. That we wrap our arms around the Huffman High School community,'' Woodfin said. \"Our entire Birmingham community is in mourning and grief right now. While there are many questions ...we need to take to the time realize that a life was lost. \" \n \n Dozens of police officers gathered at the school Thursday morning, as the investigation into yesterday's fatal shooting continues. A small memorial of red balloons and flowers were placed on the fence, near the school's driveway. \n \n Birmingham City Councilor Lashunda Scales, who represents the Huffman area, was also present Thursday. She commented on what she thinks the school can do to increase security, and said Arrington had a \"beautiful, radiant smile.\" \n \n Denise Kendricks, who lives in Huffman, stopped by the school Thursday morning to voice her concerns about security measures in place. \"These kids are out here crying for our help,\" she said through tears. \"Something has to happen. Somebody's got to be held accountable.\" \n \n Kendricks has a son, who serves in the military and lives in Florida, a daughter who recently graduated from Auburn University, and a six-year-old who goes to school nearby. None of her children went to Huffman High. \"I expect my child to come home [from school]. I never expect my child to not make it home,\" she said. \"I can't even wrap my brain around that.\" \n \n The woman also said she's frustrated with others offering prayers and setting up vigils. She said, \"We're past candlelight vigils. It's too late for that. Where were you yesterday? Where were you the day before yesterday?\" \n \n \"These are the things [students] are seeing every single day....

McConnell can only afford two defections, with every Senate Democrat expected to be a \u201cno\u201d vote. \n \n In an effort to buck up the conservatives, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) \u2014 the largest group of conservatives in the House \u2014 warned that the Senate risks seeing its bill die in the House if it drifts too far to the center. \n \n The RSC specifically warned that the bill would lose support in the House if it did not keep four provisions, including the phasing out of extra federal funding for Medicaid in 2020. They also warned McConnell against preserving ObamaCare\u2019s tax increases, removing language defunding Planned Parenthood or barring refundable tax credits from being used to \u201cfederally fund abortions.\u201d \n \n In a bid to keep moderate Republicans on board, McConnell has proposed phasing out enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion in 2023. \n \n GOP senators have also discussed keeping ObamaCare taxes to help pay for the costs of the bill, and language on Planned Parenthood in the House bill may be struck down by the Senate parliamentarian. The Senate plans to use special budgetary rules to prevent Democrats from filibustering the healthcare bill, but this makes certain provisions vulnerable under other Senate rules. \n \n James Wallner, a former aide to Lee and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who are both playing active roles in the healthcare talks, said the RSC letter shows that conservatives are laying down their markers before it\u2019s too late. \n \n \u201cTo the extent that the bulk of the party wants to pass the House-passed bill or a modified version of the House-passed bill, individual members need to take steps to give themselves leverage heading into that kind of high-stakes showdown,\u201d he said. \n \n Senate Democrats are hoping to have an impact, too. They threatened Monday to grind the Senate to a halt to protest Republicans\u2019 decision to craft the bill in private meetings, skipping the regular order of holding hearings and marking it up in public committee sessions. \n \n \u201cIf Republicans won\u2019t relent and debate their healthcare bill in the open for the American people to see, then they shouldn\u2019t expect business as usual in the Senate,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerSenate Dems hold floor talk-a-thon against latest ObamaCare repeal bill This week: Senate wrapping up defense bill after amendment fight Cuomo warns Dems against cutting DACA deal with Trump MORE (N.Y.). \n \n Democrats planned to hold a late-night talk-a-thon on the Senate floor Monday night to put the spotlight on the GOP\u2019s secretive tactics \u2014 a strategy Democrats used earlier this year to protest some of Trump\u2019s controversial Cabinet picks. \n \n The three conservatives are pressing different issues on healthcare. \n \n Paul has made clear to colleagues that he will not support legislation that creates a new GOP-sponsored entitlement program in the form of refundable tax credits to help low-income people buy private insurance plans. \n \n Lee and Cruz are pressing GOP leaders to allow states to get out of two major regulatory requirements under ObamaCare. \n \n One, known as guaranteed issue, mandates that insurance companies sell insurance plans to people regardless of how sick they are, and another, known as community rating, prohibits insurance companies from pricing those plans to reflect the greater financial risk of insuring people with pre-existing medical conditions. \n \n A GOP source familiar with the negotiations said McConnell has so far refused to promise conservatives to let states opt out of the community rating requirement \u2014 which keeps health plans more affordable for sick people but sends premiums soaring \u2014 or to exempt states altogether from the regulatory mandate and allow them to opt in. \n \n McConnell, however, is worried that if he effectively guts ObamaCare\u2019s popular prohibition against insurers charging higher prices for sick people, he would lose moderate votes. \n \n Conservatives are stepping up their efforts to mold the bill, as it\u2019s become apparent that Trump is primarily interested in a political victory and is willing to cater to moderates to get one. \n \n At a meeting at the White House last week with prominent centrists such as Sens.

The timeline could change based on the response from individual senators toward the proposal at party meetings, but Republicans are increasingly optimistic they can hold a vote next week if this week's lunch talks go well. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sen. Bob Corker said Tuesday that he expects legislation to be made public on Thursday and for a vote to take place roughly a week later. The Tennessee Republican told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d he would have preferred \"a more open process\" but that he would ultimately vote based on the substance of the measure. \n \n \"I believed the majority leader when he said he's going to take it up. I expect us to vote on it next week,\" Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Monday. \"It's close. Everybody's been counting [votes] since the beginning. It's been close since the beginning.\" \n \n Such a timeline would mean Republicans would have about a week to review text of a bill to repeal the 2010 health care law. Burr said he would be comfortable with that timeline: \"We\u2019ll debate it for 20 hours.\" \n \n Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said he hopes Republicans have \"as much time as it takes\" to study the proposal.

Asked whether they will vote this month, he replied: \"We could. But clearly I wonder if we could.\" \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tried on Monday evening to get Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to allowing at least 10 hours to review the legislation before it comes to the floor for a vote. McConnell wouldn't commit to such a number. \n \n \"We'll have ample opportunity to read and amend the bill,\" McConnell said. \n \n The timeline could blow up because there is no final deal yet on any of the sticking points and negotiations are still extremely fluid. McConnell can lose just two senators in his 52-member caucus to pass the bill, with Vice President Mike Pence as a tie-breaker. \n \n Democrats have been revving up their opposition to the legislation, organizing hours of speeches on Monday attacking the GOP's secretive process. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called it \"an affront to democracy itself.\" \n \n Democrats spent Monday drawing a contrast between the passage of Obamacare and its potential repeal, emphasizing that hundreds of Republican amendments were considered and Congress devoted weeks to debate in committee and on the floor before the bill, also known as the Affordable Care Act, was passed. \n \n \"We had a month of debate in the United States Senate in 2009 \u2014 that seems like a reasonable amount of time\" for the GOP bill, said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \n \n But Republicans threw the Democrats' own history on health care back at them, arguing that Democrats deployed secretive techniques and the party-line budget reconciliation process to ultimately pass a portion of Obamacare into law. \n \n \"I hope they'll have more time than we did on Christmas Eve when [former Sen. Harry] Reid produced his bill,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). \n \n Republican leaders believe that entering the July 4th recess with their Obamacare quagmire unsolved could lose votes as well as hurt the GOP politically. But the rushed timeline could put rank-and-file Republicans in a tough spot with little time to deliberate such a consequential vote. \n \n \"We're going to need a significant amount of time,\" to review text, said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). \"More than hours.\" His remarks are the latest from rank-and-file GOP senators who have grumbled publicly about the process even as their leadership has vowed to steam ahead. \n \n Last week, Republicans discussed insurance market stabilization in the short term as well as how to overhaul Medicaid and wind down its expansion. One proposal being floated would phase out the law's Medicaid expansion over three years beginning in 2020 or 2021 and eventually curb the Medicaid growth rate more strictly than the House-passed bill, but that proposal has not yet been agreed on. \n \n This week, Republicans will discuss how far to cut Obamacare's regulatory regime and how much to beef up the House bill's tax credits to help people buy insurance. Conservatives want to gut the regulations as much as possible; there is more consensus on the tax credits but not necessarily how to pay for them. \n \n There is no guarantee the legislation will pass given the party divisions. But McConnell has made clear to associates he prefers not to let the bill linger so the Senate can turn to funding the government, raising the debt ceiling and rewriting the tax code, according to people who speak with him regularly. ||||| WASHINGTON\u2014Senate GOP leaders have set a timeline to vote next week on legislation to repeal large chunks of the Affordable Care Act, even though they don\u2019t yet appear to have secured enough support to pass it. \n \n Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is intent on keeping pressure on Senate Republicans to move quickly on the bill rolling back and replacing much of the 2010 health law, lawmakers and GOP aides said.

Sources tell the Washington Post that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far refused to promise that states will be allowed to opt out of two ObamaCare regulations. One is community rating, which prevents insurance companies from pricing plans based on the greater risk of insuring people with pre-existing medical conditions. The other is guaranteed issue, which mandates that insurance plans sell to people regardless of how sick they are. Paul and Cruz want states to get out of both regulations. McConnell is worried that if he guts ObamaCare's popular prohibition against insurers charging higher prices for sick people, he would lose moderate votes. \u2013 The GOP's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare could hit the Senate floor as soon as next week, Politico reports. According to multiple sources, Senate Republicans are working behind closed doors to finalize a bill and bring it to the floor for a vote. The timeline could change based on the response from individual senators toward the proposal at party meetings, but Republicans are increasingly optimistic they can hold a vote next week if this week's lunch talks go well. Sen. Bob Corker says he expects legislation to be made public on Thursday and a vote to take place roughly a week later. \"I believed the majority leader when he said he's going to take it up. I expect us to vote on it next week,\" Sen. Richard Burr says. \"It's close. Everybody's been counting since the beginning. ... We'll debate it for 20 hours.\" But the timeline could blow up because there is no final deal yet on any of the sticking points and negotiations are still extremely fluid. Democrats have slammed Republicans for moving so quickly and without holding public hearings. \u2013 The GOP's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare appears to be moving closer to the Senate floor. After a last-minute deal to add language to the House bill fell through, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the measure Thursday or Friday, the AP reports. \"We'll have ample opportunity to read and amend the bill,\" McConnell said, though the timeline could blow up if no final deal is reached, the Los Angeles Times notes. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried last night to get McConnell to commit to allowing at least 10 hours of review of the legislation before it comes to the floor for a vote. McConnell wouldn't commit to such a number. The rushed timeline could put rank-and-file Republicans in a tough spot with little time to deliberate such a consequential vote. Democrats have been revving up their opposition to the legislation, organizing hours of speeches on Monday accusing the GOP of secretive process. Sen. Brian Schatz called it \"an affront to democracy itself.\" \u2013 Senate Republicans plan a vote next week on legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, even though they don't have enough votes to pass it yet, the Wall Street Journal reports. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to keep pressure on Republicans to move quickly on the repeal-and-replace bill, but the effort could backfire as some conservative and moderate Republicans oppose it. The Senate bill would repeal most of ObamaCare, including the individual and employer mandates, the Medicaid expansion, and the Medicare sunset provision, but it would replace most of the Affordable Care Act's subsidies with tax credits for people who buy insurance, according to the New York Times. The Times notes that the subsidies are popular with younger, healthier Americans, who would be most affected by the repeal.",

    "document": "Illinois congressman Aaron Schock now faces a possible ethics investigation over his newly-decorated office on Capitol Hill. NBC Chicago\u2019s political reporter Mary Ann Ahern reports. (Published Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015) \n \n Washington watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics filed an ethics complaint Tuesday to investigate Rep. Aaron Schock after it was found the Illinois congressman may have used campaign funding to decorate his congressional offices. \n \n Rep. Schock just recently redesigned his Capitol Hill congressional office with bright red walls and luxurious finishes such as a crystal chandelier and gold sconces, the Washington Post reported. \n \n The lavish look was inspired by the PBS hit show \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d Schock\u2019s decorator told the Washington Post. \n \n Anne Brahler, a downstate Illinois interior decorator, told the publication she was not paid for her services, and this was not the first time she designed Schock\u2019s congressional office. \n \n Accepting \u201cgifts\u201d, which are defined by the House as any item or service having monetary value, is something that is strictly prohibited by law. \n \n \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not totally surprising that the same congressman who spent campaign money on P90X workout DVDs wanted to create a more picturesque setting in which to be photographed, but the rules clearly require him to pay for those renovations himself,\u201d CREW\u2019s executive director Anne Weismann said in a statement. \u201cAgain and again, Rep. Schock\u2019s seeming obsession with his image impedes his ability to conduct himself in ethical manner.\u201d \n \n What makes the office\u2019s \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d theme even more interesting is Congressman Schock repeatedly voted to end federal funding for PBS. His spokesman has told reporters he is not a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fan. \n \n Rep. Schock could not immediately be reached for comment. ||||| \n \n Rep. Aaron Schock\u2019s (R-Ill.) new office in the Rayburn Office Building, which was designed to resemble the dining room of the PBS show \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d (Ben Terris/TWP) \n \n The Rayburn House Office Building is a labyrinth of beige offices. \n \n And then, there\u2019s . . . Rep. Aaron Schock\u2019s new digs. \n \n Bright red walls. A gold-colored wall sconce with black candles. A Federal-style bull\u2019s-eye mirror with an eagle perched on top. And this is just the Illinois Republican\u2019s outer office. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s actually based off of the red room in \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 \u201d said the woman behind the front desk, comparing it to the luxurious set piece at the heart of the British period drama. \n \n [March 17: Schock has resigned; get the latest here.] \n \n This was a bold room. But the confidence was a mirage. For on Capitol Hill, caution is king when it comes to the micromanagement of one\u2019s image, even in the case of how a congressman decides to decorate his office. \n \n And sometimes, a friendly outsider can inadvertently ruin a communications director\u2019s day. \n \n A blond woman popped out of an inner office. \u201cWant to see the rest?\u201d she asked. \n \n She introduced herself as Annie Brahler, the interior decorator whose company is called Euro Trash. She guided me to Schock\u2019s private office, revealing another dramatic red room. This one with a drippy crystal chandelier, a table propped up by two eagles, a bust of Abraham Lincoln and massive arrangements of pheasant feathers. \n \n Then, my phone rang. \n \n It was Schock\u2019s communications director, Benjamin Cole. \n \n \u201cAre you taking pictures of the office?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho told you you could do that? . . . Okay, stay where you are. You\u2019ve created a bit of a crisis in the office.\u201d \n \n A staff member then came and asked me to please delete the photos from my phone. So started a day of back-and-forths with a congressman\u2019s office about interior design. \n \n \n \n Red walls stand out against the beige, eggshell, light blue, light gray or light yellow walls of neighboring offices in the Rayburn House Office Building.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP) \n \n Washington has always been more \u201cVeep\u201d than \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d \n \n Schock, 33, is one of the rising stars of the Republican Party. He\u2019s young, has six-pack abs that landed him on the cover of Men\u2019s Health and is a prodigious fundraiser. He\u2019s also one of the most media-savvy members of Congress, with an Instagram feed that features him surfing, hiking across glaciers, tangoing on the streets of Buenos Aires and smiling next to duck-faced pop star Ariana Grande. \n \n An office decorated in a unique way would hardly be surprising; it would just be another interesting fact about a congressman who has built a brand as not just another politician. So why was this a crisis? \n \n \u201cYou\u2019ve got a member [of Congress] willing to talk to you about other things,\u201d Cole said on the phone. \u201cWhy sour it by rushing to write some gossipy piece?\u201d \n \n The magnitude of this manufactured PR catastrophe seemed to elude Brahler, who lives and operates her business in Illinois. She was happy to discuss her work, saying she didn\u2019t get why the staff acted so \u201cprickly.\u201d \n \n Brahler met the congressman in his district years ago, and he was impressed with her work, which he had seen in magazines. She likes to say that she can turn things ready for the trash heap into something beautiful. \n \n \n \n Pheasant feathers on display in Rep. Aaron Schock\u2019s new office.

(Ben Terris/TWP) \n \n When a member of Congress moves into an office, the bare essentials are provided by the House of Representatives. Furniture and computers are often handed down by other offices. New members are also entitled to a new paint job, although there are only a limited number of available colors \u2014 beige, eggshell, light blue, light gray or light yellow \u2014 that the House will provide. Additional decorations must come out of the lawmaker\u2019s pocket. \n \n Brahler offered her services for free, according to Schock\u2019s office, although he had to pay for the objects. She had decorated his old office on the fifth floor of the Cannon House Office Building, one of the least desirable pieces of congressional real estate. While his new office takes a bit of inspiration from \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d it\u2019s not a replica of what\u2019s seen on the PBS hit. \n \n \u201cI guess because he\u2019s fresh-minded and forward-thinking, he\u2019s not hung up on doing things the same way as everyone else,\u201d Brahler said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to where he\u2019s comfortable with everything I do.\u201d \n \n Except, perhaps, when she gives a tour of his office to a journalist. \n \n \u201cYou see, the congressman hasn\u2019t even seen the office yet,\u201d Cole told me later. \u201cSurely, it wouldn\u2019t be fair for you to write about his office until he has the chance to see it.\u201d \n \n I told him if I could be there when Schock first saw the office, I would hold off till then. Cole agreed, and we reached the Red Walls Accord of 2015. \n \n That is, until Schock decided he wasn\u2019t interested in doing a whole story about how his office is decorated. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s happy to talk to you, just not about the office,\u201d Cole said, sounding very tired of the ordeal. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry and want you to know this is not fun for me.\u201d \n \n Cole was back in touch later to add one more piece of information relating to Schock and \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he watches it; I don\u2019t know what shows he watches. But I don\u2019t think he watches much TV.\u201d ||||| Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., speaks outside the state Capitol in Springfield, Ill., on Nov. 3, 2014. (Photo: Seth Perlman, AP) \n \n Rep. Aaron Schock apparently appreciates a lovely office. \n \n Schock has spent tens of thousands of dollars from his taxpayer-funded accounts on renovations, leather furniture and even granite countertops, according to congressional expenditure reports. \n \n The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the Illinois Republican has had his office lavishly redecorated in a bold red theme inspired by the television show Downton Abbey. \n \n There is no telling how much Schock paid for the renovations of his Capitol Hill suite \u2014 the House takes a few months to publicly report current expenses \u2014 but in prior years, Schock appears to have spent tens of thousands of dollars on office renovations and furnishings from his taxpayer-funded account. \n \n Schock's spokesman did not return emails seeking comment or an explanation of the various expenditures, so it is not clear precisely what the expenditures were for. \n \n In December 2009 he paid $7,400 to an Illinois design/build firm called KBL Design Center, and then another $21,000 to a hardwood floor company, a building contractor and company called Old World Granite and Marble that apparently makes high-end countertops. He then spent $6,600 on an Illinois painting contractor. \n \n Two months later, Schock spent $79,061 on furniture purchases, including $5,123 from a company called Mulnix Industries that specializes in hardwood podiums. \n \n Around the same time, Schock spent more than $4,000 with a fine-leather furniture company called Garrett Leather. \n \n All of the expenditures came out of Schock's taxpayer-funded office account, which lawmakers can use to buy office furniture and pay for renovations.The official handbook for members of Congress says \"Ordinary and necessary expenses related to the acquisition of items for use in offices are reimbursable from the applicable office funds.\" \n \n Each member of Congress is given a set budget for operating their office each year, including hiring staff and all official travel; any furniture purchases and renovations come out of that budget. Money left over in the office budget at the end of the year can be returned to the treasury. \n \n The Washington Post story quoted the designer of Schock's Capitol Hill office as saying she provided her design services to Schock for free. That led the liberal group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington to file a complaint Tuesday with the House alleging that Schock may have received an improper gift. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1DDcekr",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Rep. Aaron Schock, an up-and-comer previously best known for baring his six-pack on the cover of Men's Health, has a new claim to fame in the form of his interior decor: It seems the Washington Post's Style reporter Ben Terris popped by the Illinois rep's digs in the Rayburn House Office Building, and ran into Schock's interior decorator, who showed him around. Terris describes the outer office thusly: \"Bright red walls. A gold-colored wall sconce with black candles. A Federal-style bull\u2019s-eye mirror with an eagle perched on top.\" \"It's actually based off the red room in Downton Abbey,\" an aide helpfully told Terris of his outer office. The rest of Terris' piece describes Schock's team trying to squash the story. USA Today took the ball and dug back to 2009 and 2010 and found about $118,000 in office expenditures\u2014including $4,000 on fine-leather furniture and $79,061 on other furniture\u2014that Schock billed to a taxpayer-funded account. Which is turning into kind of an upstairs-downstairs conundrum: While it's not yet clear how much the Downton renovation cost, Schock's interior decorator says she worked for free, thus saving the taxpayer\u2014but prompting CREW to file an ethics complaint claiming that Schock illegally received a gift. \"Perhaps it\u2019s not totally surprising that the same congressman who spent campaign money on P90X workout DVDs wanted to create a more picturesque setting in which to be photographed, but the rules clearly require him to pay for those renovations himself,\" says CREW\u2019s executive director, per NBC Chicago. \"Again and again, Rep.

Wang Qi has been unable to leave India ever since - and longs to see his family in China. BBC Hindi's Vineet Khare met him. \n \n Tirodi village is a nearly five-hour drive from the nearest airport in Nagpur in central India. \n \n I am here to meet Wang Qi, a Chinese army surveyor who entered India in 1963 but could never go back. For over five decades, he has been longing to see his family back home. \n \n Sporting cropped white hair, black trainers and a body warmer, Mr Wang, who is now in his eighties, hugs me when we meet. We are about to try and make video contact with his family more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) away in China. \n \n Together we go to the government office, which is the only centre equipped with internet for miles around. \n \n Image caption \"I couldn't recognise him. He looked so old. He said he was alive just for me.\" \n \n He watches in anticipation as I dial and then his eyes light up as the image of his elder brother Wang Zhiyuan, 82, appears on the screen, seated on a sofa in Xianyang, a city in China's Shaanxi province. \n \n The two brothers are seeing each other after more than 50 years. The conversation in Mandarin lasts 17 minutes. \n \n \"I couldn't recognise him. He looked so old. He said he was alive just for me,\" Wang Qi, also known by his Indian name Raj Bahadur, tells me in strongly accented Hindi as his three Indian-born children gather around to comfort him. \n \n Mr Wang's story is a long and sad one. \n \n Born to a farmer family in Shaanxi with four brothers and two sisters, he studied surveying and joined China's People's Liberation Army in 1960. \n \n Mr Wang says he was \"tasked with building roads for the Chinese army\" and was captured when he \"strayed erroneously\" inside India's territory in January 1963. \n \n \"I had gone out of my camp for a stroll but lost my way. I was tired and hungry. I saw a Red Cross vehicle and asked them to help me. They handed me over to the Indian army,\" he said. \n \n Image caption Mr Wang's mother died in 2006 before he could go back and see her \n \n Indian officials said Mr Wang \"intruded into India\" and gave \"false background and the circumstances\" about his whereabouts to the authorities. \n \n He spent the next seven years in a number of different jails before a court ordered his release in 1969. \n \n Police took him to Tirodi, a far-flung village in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. He has not been allowed to leave the country ever since. \n \n It's still not clear whether Mr Wang is a prisoner of war. But he has been denied official Indian documents or citizenship and also been denied permission to travel back. His family says Mr Wang needs a document to exit India. \n \n Senior local official Bharat Yadav agrees that there have been \"deficiencies\" and a \"lack of interest\" in the case. \n \n \"There are no suspicions about his actions. If he wants to go back, we will try and help him,\" he said. \n \n An official at the Chinese embassy, which helped him secure a passport in 2013, acknowledged he was aware of the issue. A response to questions sent to India's federal home ministry is still awaited. \n \n It has been a long, excruciating wait for Mr Wang. \n \n Image caption Wang Qi joined China's People's Liberation Army in 1960 \n \n Be it language, food or a vastly different society, Mr Wang has had to adapt every step of the way. \n \n \"I began by working in a flour mill. But I cried in the night as I longed for my family. I missed my mother,\" he said. \n \n \"I wondered what I had got into.\" \n \n Mr Wang married a local girl, Sushila, under \"pressure from friends\" in 1975. \n \n \"I was livid with my parents for marrying me off to an outsider. I had trouble understanding his language. I tolerated him for a few months. Then I got used to him,\" she says with a smile. \n \n Mr Wang tried his hand at business but his undefined legal status meant visits by local police. \n \n Image caption Mr Wang married a local girl, Sushila, under \"pressure from friends\" in 1975 \n \n \"I remember Mr Wang being beaten by the police for not bribing them.

He would cycle for miles with no break,\" another former neighbour Jayanti Lal Waghela says. \n \n Mr Wang wrote letters home but received his first reply only in the 1980s. Family pictures were exchanged. \n \n He spoke to his mother for the first time in more than 40 years on the phone in 2002. \n \n \"She said she wanted to see me as her last days were near. I said I was trying to return.

He remained stuck there for 54 years, making it back to his homeland only last week, reports the BBC. The strange tale of Wang Qi starts with a nighttime stroll away from camp. He told the BBC in a previous interview that he got lost and was \"tired and hungry.\" He found a Red Cross vehicle and asked for help, only to be turned over to the Indian army. After nearly seven years in various jails, authorities relocated Wang to a remote village, the Hindustan Times reports. He was not allowed to return to China, however, but nor was he given Indian citizenship. He lived in a kind of limbo. \"I cried in the night,\" Wang says of those first years in India. \"I missed my mother.\" He eventually married, worked at a flour mill, and had children and grandchildren, but he never stopped hoping to return home. A spokesperson for the Chinese government blames Indian bureaucracy for preventing Wang's return over the past half-century. But after being visited by a delegation from the Chinese embassy in recent weeks, visas were procured for Wang and his relatives. His wife was too sick to travel, but Wang arrived in Beijing on Friday with his adult children, where they were met by his surviving relatives. This is only a visit, however. \"My family is (in India),\" he says. \"Where would I go?\" (For this soldier, WWII didn't end until 1974.)",

    "document": "As the crude crept closer to Florida, the risky effort to contain the nation's worst oil spill hit a snag Wednesday when a diamond-edged saw became stuck in a thick pipe on a blown-out well at the bottom of the Gulf. \n \n Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said the goal was to free the saw and finish the cut later in the day. This is the latest attempt to contain _ not plug _ the gusher. The best chance at stopping the leak is a relief well, which is at least two months from completion. \n \n \"I don't think the issue is whether or not we can make the second cut. It's about how fine we can make it, how smooth we can make it,\" Allen said. \n \n If the cut is not as smooth as engineers would like, they would be forced to put a looser fitting cap on top of the oil spewing out. This cut-and-cap effort could temporarily increase the flow of oil by as much as 20 percent, though Allen said officials wouldn't know whether that had happened until the cut could be completed. \n \n Engineers may have to bring in a second saw awaiting on a boat, but it was not immediately clear how long that could delay the operation. Live video showed oil spewing out of the new cut, and crews were shooting chemicals to try to disperse the crude. The cap could be placed over the spill as early as Wednesday. \n \n The effort underwater was going on as oil drifted close to the Florida Panhandle's white sand beaches for the first time and investors ran from BP's stock for a second day, reacting to the company's weekend failure to plug the leak by shooting mud and cement into the well, known as the top kill. \n \n Meanwhile, President Barack Obama said in prepared remarks that it was time to roll back billions of dollars in tax breaks for oil companies and use the money for clean energy research and development. He said the catastrophic Gulf oil spill shows the country must move toward clean energy, tapping natural gas and nuclear power and eliminating tax breaks for big oil. \n \n The Justice Department also has announced it started criminal and civil probes into the spill, although the department did not name specific targets for prosecution. \n \n Shares in British-based BP PLC were down 3 percent early Wednesday before recovering in London trading, a day after a 13 percent fall. BP has lost $75 billion in market value since the spill started with an April 20 oil rig explosion and analysts expect damage claims to total billions more. \n \n In Florida, oil was about seven miles south of Pensacola Beach, Allen said. \n \n Thunderstorms were making it difficult to track the slick, Escambia County emergency director John Dosh said, and officials hoped the weather would clear so they could get an aerial view. \n \n It was raining and cloudy at the beach off and on. The four pirate flags on top of Peg Leg Pete's Oyster Bar on the beach where flapping eastward, which could send the oil closer to shore. Peg Leg Pete's is a beach institution frequented by boaters who pull up behind the restaurant in a cove off Pensacola Bay. \n \n It was a slow Memorial Day weekend. Hundreds of tourists enjoyed the turquoise waters, but it wasn't as busy as usual. \n \n \"We are looking at a Wednesday to Friday shoreline impact, but there is a line of uncertainty that depends on the wave action and the winds,\" Dosh said. \n \n \"Today we are in a monitoring mode.\" \n \n Emergency crews began scouring the beaches for oil and shoring up miles of boom, though choppy waters from thunderstorms could send the oil over the protective lines. County officials are using the boom to block oil from reaching inland waterways but plan to leave beaches unprotected because they are easier to clean up. \n \n \"It's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches,\" said Keith Wilkins, deputy chief of neighborhood and community services for Escambia County. \n \n The oil has been spreading in the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded six weeks ago, killing 11 workers and eventually sinking. The rig was being operated for BP, the largest oil and gas producer in the Gulf. \n \n Crude has already been reported along barrier islands in Alabama and Mississippi, and it has polluted some 125 miles of Louisiana coastline. \n \n Some 2,000 feet above the Chandeleur islands off the Louisiana coast, vast stretches of sheen meandered through the water, some reflecting pale rainbow colors. Farther away, swaths of oil was in various sizes and thickness _ from pale, barely detectable streams to rust-rimmed blue and purple patches that looked like giant bruises. \n \n \"The problem is this oil now is really like a collection of smaller spills,\" Allen said during flight in a C-144. \n \n Allen, the national incident commander for the spill, said the threat of oil hitting the coast was shifting east and skimmer vessels would be working offshore to intercept as much crude as possible. \n \n Earlier this week, BP officials said they were concentrating cleanup efforts in Louisiana because they did not expect oil to reach other states. The company has set up floating hotels on barges to house cleanup crews closer to the Louisiana shores. \n \n In Venice, La., hundreds of oil response workers were grounded by storms and many local fishermen hired in the so-called vessels of opportunity program were sent home early. Venice is a major staging center for the oil response, with nearly 1,500 workers and dozens of boats in this small town in the marshes. \n \n \"Boats were staged and ready to go\" in case there was a break in the weather, said BP spokesman Mike Abendoff. \n \n Some work continued, including at a 32-acre site where an \"employee village\" is being built to eventually house as many as 1,500 workers in trailers. Abendoff hoped to start putting some workers there by early next week. \n \n More federal fishing waters were closed, too, another setback for one of the region's most important industries. More than one-third of federal waters were off-limits for fishing, along with hundreds of square miles of state waters. \n \n ___ \n \n Bluestein reported from Covington, La.

    "document": "Emergency workers stand on a blocked street in Barcelona, Spain, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017. A white van jumped up onto a sidewalk and sped down a pedestrian zone Thursday in Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas... (Associated Press) \n \n BARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 A van veered onto a promenade and barreled down the busy walkway in central Barcelona on Thursday, swerving back and forth as it mowed down pedestrians and turned a picturesque tourist destination into a bloody killing zone. Thirteen people were killed and 100 were injured, 15 of them seriously, in what authorities called a terror attack. \n \n The late afternoon attack in the city's Las Ramblas district left victims sprawled in the historic street, spattered with blood or writhing in pain from broken limbs. Others were ushered inside shops by officers with their guns drawn or fled in panic, screaming and carrying young children in their arms. \n \n \"It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,\" Josep Lluis Trapero, a senior police official for Spain's Catalonia region told reporters late Thursday. \n \n The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, saying in a statement on its Aamaq news agency that the attack was carried out by \"soldiers of the Islamic State\" in response to the extremist group's calls for followers to target countries participating in the coalition trying to drive it from Syria and Iraq. \n \n Early Friday, Catalan police said they shot and killed five suspects in a seaside resort town south of Barcelona in response to a terrorist attack. They also said six civilians were injured in Cambrils but didn't immediately say how. The force is working on the theory that the Cambrils suspects are linked to the Barcelona attack, as well as to a Wednesday night explosion in the town of Alcanar in which one person was killed. \n \n The Catalan regional government said citizens from 24 countries were among the people killed and injured during the Barcelona van attack. \n \n Authorities said the dead included a Belgian and a Greek woman was among the injured. Australia confirmed three of its citizens were injured; two others were Taiwanese and one was from Hong Kong, according to their governments. Germany was investigating whether its citizens were among the dead or injured. \n \n Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the killings a \"savage terrorist attack\" and said Spaniards \"are not just united in mourning, but especially in the firm determination to beat those who want to rob us of our values and our way of life.\" \n \n After the afternoon attack, Las Ramblas went into lockdown. Swarms of officers brandishing hand guns and automatic weapons launched a manhunt in the downtown district, ordering stores and cafes and public transport to shut down. \n \n Several hours later authorities reported two arrests, one a Spanish national from Melilla, a Spanish-run Mediterranean seafront enclave in North Africa, and the other a Moroccan. They declined to identify them. \n \n Trapero said neither of them was the van's driver, who remained at large after abandoning the van and fleeing on foot. The arrests took place in the northern Catalan town of Ripoll and in Alcanar, where a gas explosion in a house is being investigated for a possible connection. \n \n Spanish public broadcaster RTVE and other news outlets named one of the detained as Driss Oukabir, a French citizen of Moroccan origin. RTVE reported said Oukabir went to police in Ripoll to report that his identity documents had been stolen. Various Spanish media said the IDs with his name were found in the attack van and that he claimed his brother might have stolen them. \n \n Media outlets ran photographs of Oukabir they said police had issued to identify one of the suspects. The regional police told the Associated Press that they had not distributed the photograph. They refused to say if he was one of the two detained. \n \n Barcelona is the latest European city where attackers used a vehicle as a weapon of terror against a popular tourist destination, after other deadly attacks in France, Germany, Sweden and Britain. \n \n \"London, Brussels, Paris and some other European cities have had the same experience. It's been Barcelona's turn today,\" Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalonia's government. \n \n Thursday's bloodshed was Spain's deadliest attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 192 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. In the years since, Spanish authorities have arrested nearly 200 jihadists. The only deadly attacks were bombings claimed by the Basque separatist group ETA that killed five people over the past decade but it declared a cease-fire in 2011. \n \n \"Unfortunately, Spaniards know the absurd and irrational pain that terrorism causes. We have received blows like this in recent years, but we also that terrorists can be beaten,\" Rajoy said. \n \n During the search for the perpetrators, troopers shot and killed a man who was in a vehicle that hit two officers at a traffic blockade on the outskirts of Barcelona. But Trapero said the driver's actions were not linked to the van attack. \n \n Las Ramblas cuts through the center of Barcelona and is one of the city's top tourist destinations. It is a wide avenue of stalls and shops with a pedestrian-only walkway in the center while cars can travel on either side. \n \n A taxi driver who witnessed the attack, Oscar Cano, said the white van suddenly jumped the curb and sped down the central pedestrian area at a high speed for about 500 yards (457 meters), veering from side to side as it targeted people. \n \n \"I heard a lot of people screaming and then I saw the van going down the boulevard,\" another witness, Miguel Angel Rizo, told The Associated Press. \"You could see all the bodies lying through Las Ramblas. It was brutal. A very tough image to see.\" \n \n Jordi Laparra, a 55-year-old physical education teacher and Barcelona resident, said it initially looked like a terrible traffic accident. \n \n \"At first I thought it was an accident, as the van crashed into 10 people or so and seemed to get stuck. But then he maneuvered left and accelerated full speed down the Ramblas and I realized it was a terrorist attack,\" Laparra said. \"He zigzagged from side to side into the kiosks, pinning as many people as he could, so they had no escape.\" \n \n Carol Augustin, a manager at La Palau Moja, an 18th-century former palace on Las Ramblas that now houses offices and a tourism center, said the van passed in front of the building. \n \n \"People started screaming and running into the office. It was such a chaotic situation. There were families with children,\" she said. \n \n Dutch visitor Tamara Jurgen said she and a friend were inside a clothing store steps from the scene and were kept inside until it was safe to leave. \n \n \"We were downstairs when it happened and everyone was screaming and running. We had to run up to the roof and throw our bags over a wall,\" Jurgen said. \"We were all together along this wall and we were scared we were going to have to jump.\" \n \n Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau announced a minute of silence to be held Friday in Barcelona's main square \"to show that we are not scared.\" The prime minister announced three days of national mourning. \n \n Leaders around the world offered their support and condolences to Barcelona after the attack. \n \n President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. condemned the attack and \"will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\" \n \n British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. \"stands with Spain against terror\" while French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: \"All my thoughts and solidarity from France for the victims of the tragic attack in Barcelona. We will remain united and determined.\" \n \n Spain has been on a security alert one step below the maximum since June 2015 following attacks elsewhere in Europe and Africa. \n \n Cars, trucks and vans have been the weapon of choice in multiple extremist attacks in Europe in the last year. \n \n The deadliest targeted Bastille Day revelers in Nice, France, in July 2016, killing 86 people. In December 2016, 12 people died after a driver used a hijacked truck to drive into a Christmas market in Berlin. \n \n Multiple attacks occurred in London this year.

Islamic State said the perpetrators of the latest one had been responding to its call to target countries involved in a U.S.-led coalition against the Sunni militant group. \n \n Hours after the van rampage, police shot dead five people in the Catalan resort of Cambrils, 120 km (75 miles) down the coast from Barcelona, after they drove their car at pedestrians and police officers. \n \n The five assailants had an ax and knives in their car and wore fake explosive belts, police said. A single police officer shot four of the men, Trapero said. \n \n A Spanish woman was killed in the Cambrils incident, while several other civilians and a police officer were injured. \n \n Trapero had earlier said the investigation was focusing on a house in Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, which was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday. \n \n Police believe the house was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there. \n \n However, the apparently accidental explosion at the house forced the conspirators to scale down their plans and to hurriedly carry out more \u201crudimentary\u201d attacks, Trapero said. \n \n FOUR ARRESTS \n \n Police have arrested four people in connection with the attacks - three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain\u2019s North African enclave of Melilla, Trapero said. They were aged between 21 and 34, and none had a history of terrorism-related activities. \n \n Another three people have been identified but are still at large. Spanish media said two of them may have been killed by the blast in Alcanar while one man of Moroccan origin was still sought by the police. \n \n People gather around an impromptu memorial a day after a van crashed into pedestrians at Las Ramblas in Barcelona, Spain August 18, 2017. REUTERS/Sergio Perez \n \n Police in France are looking for the driver of a white Renault Kangoo van that may have been used by people involved in the Barcelona attack, a French police source told Reuters. \n \n WORST SINCE 2004 \n \n It was the deadliest attack in Spain since March 2004, when Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people. \n \n Of 126 people injured in Barcelona and Cambrils, 65 were still in hospital and 17 were in a critical condition. The dead and injured came from 34 countries, ranging from France and Germany to Pakistan and the Philippines. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said an American citizen was confirmed dead, and Spanish media said several children were killed. \n \n As Spain began three days of mourning, people returned to Las Ramblas, laying flowers and lighting candles in memory of the victims. Rajoy and Spain\u2019s King Felipe visited Barcelona\u2019s main square nearby to observe a minute\u2019s silence. \n \n Defiant crowds later chanted \u201cI am not afraid\u201d in Catalan. \n \n Foreign leaders voiced condemnation and sympathy, including French President Emmanuel Macron, whose nation has suffered some of Europe\u2019s deadliest recent attacks. \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking after media reports that some Germans were among those killed, said Islamist terrorism \u201ccan never defeat us\u201d and vowed to press ahead with campaigning for a general election in Germany in September. \n \n Slideshow (21 Images) \n \n King Mohammed VI of Morocco sent his condolences to Spain. \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking by phone with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday, pledged the full support of the United States in investigating the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils and bringing the perpetrators to justice. \n \n In a message to the cardinal of Barcelona, Pope Francis said the attack was \u201can act of blind violence that is a grave offense to the Creator\u201d. \n \n Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said the attack showed the European Union\u2019s system of migrant relocation was wrong. \u201cIt is dangerous. Europe should wake up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are dealing here with a clash of civilisations.\u201d",

Clinton and top Defense officials were also on the call, which was supposed to center on how to get Americans out of harm's way. \n \n But a substantial part of the discussion, GOP investigators said, centered on how and why the attack happened rather than narrowly examining potential rescue plans. Half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting didn't have to do with evacuation; many of them were about an anti-Islam video, which the administration would incorrectly blame for the violence. \n \n The report also found that a State official brought up a question about whether Marines should wear civilian clothing instead of their uniforms. Under secretary of State for management Patrick Kennedy told investigators he wanted to ensure that security was enhanced, not hurt by flags on the uniforms of any U.S. military presence. \n \n But, one commander told the committee that as they were readying themselves to deploy they kept having to change in and out of their uniforms four times. \n \n The military never deployed to Benghazi. \n \n State Department deputy spokesperson Mark Toner in a statement said the clothing issue did not affect the speed or timeliness of any possible military response. \n \n \u201cWe are aware that the committee is critical of these issues, but we are not aware of any finding that they had any impact on the attacks or our ability to send help,\" the statement says. \"The fact is, we did not cause a delay....

Representatives Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo have signed onto the official majority document and authored a supplemental, 51-page \"additional views\" report of their own. \n \n Among the most interesting aspects of their \"additional views\" is a timeline that contrasts the story top Obama administration officials were telling in public with the very different story some of those same officials were sharing with one another in private emails, conversations and documents.

The proximate cause of the violence was the release by individuals in the United States of the video trailer for a film that many Muslims find offensive. Diplomatic compounds have been breached in several countries including Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen. In Benghazi, Libya four U.S. personnel were killed in the violence[.]\" \n \n The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack\u2014from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi, and from the nature of the well-planned, complex attack. Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to blame in Benghazi. \n \n 9/20\u2014Public Statements \n \n Excerpt from interview of the President on Univision Town Hall: \n \n In response to the question, \"We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?\" the President answered, \"[W]e're still doing an investigation[.] . . . What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests[.]\" \n \n Secretary Clinton has since blamed her statements on changing information received from U.S. intelligence reports. She and others have claimed that the 10:08 p.m. statement was not meant to ascribe a motive to the attack. Yet, Sullivan knew the morning of September 12th\u2014based on the press release from the embassy in Kabul\u2014that people had heard it exactly that way. Moreover, whether or not the intelligence information changed, Secretary Clinton's public and private statements remained unchanged\u2014publicly tying Benghazi and Cairo together and privately recognizing the violence in Benghazi was a terrorist attack with nothing to do with a protest or video. \n \n Moreover, to the extent any intelligence analysis incorrectly reported on a protest or a video in connection with Benghazi, Secretary Clinton and other State officials, who knew better, simply ignored them. As just one example, in her conversation September 15, 2012 with the president of Libya, Secretary Clinton made no mention of anything in the CIA talking points that administration officials later claimed were the best assessment available at the time, and those talking points made no mention of a video in connection with Benghazi. In short, Secretary Clinton and the administration knew better than to rely on flawed intelligence reports. Intelligence assessments may have changed. News reports may have changed. But the eye witness accounts remained same\u2014and not one said a protest had occurred. Yet, once Secretary Clinton and Ben Rhodes set the message, the truth became an afterthought. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

And there\u2019s no evidence of gun trading.\u201d \n \n The Benghazi panel on Tuesday released an 800-page report filled with new criticism of former secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonTrump bullish on Minnesota as campaign hops to blue states Clinton makes no mention of FBI news in Cleveland rally Conway: Comey mishandled Clinton investigation from beginning MORE. \n \n It concludes that Clinton and other officials did not adequately heed concerns about growing extremism in Libya. \n \n The summary also accuses Clinton, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, of falsely blaming the violence on an anti-Muslim video behind unrest elsewhere. \n \n Cummings and other panel Democrats on Monday released their rebuttal to the GOP\u2019s report in an attempt to debunk its findings. \n \n \u201cWe are issuing our own report today because, after spending more than two years and $7 million in taxpayer funds in one of the longest and most partisan congressional investigations in history, it is long past time for the select committee to conclude its work,\u201d they said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Republican-led House Benghazi committee released its final report Tuesday after two years of investigations. The 800-page report lays out the committee's findings on the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead. Here's what you need to know: Benghazi is \"unlikely to be a potent tool for weakening Clinton\" in the general election, as the committee and report have little credibility and aren't seen as serious by many, the Los Angeles Times reports. Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of \u201cculpability or wrongdoing\u201d on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being \u201cone of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. \u201cThe Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The House Benghazi committee released its long-awaited report today, concluding that the State Department's initial response to the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Libya was based on \"inaccurate, incomplete, and sometimes misleading information,\" reports the Washington Post. Specifically, the report says the department didn't tell the public that the attack was a protest over an anti-Islam video until almost an hour after it began. The report also says the military never deployed to Benghazi because the Marines had already changed in and out of their uniforms four times as they prepared to deploy, reports the New York Times. Other highlights from the report: Hillary Clinton called an emergency conference call with defense and State Department officials on the night of the attack to discuss how to get Americans out of harm's way, and half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting didn\u2019t have to do with evacuation. \"The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack\u2014from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi,\" writes the Times. \"Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to blame.\" Rep.

    "concatenated_intermediate": "\u2013 On the night of the Benghazi attack, Hillary Clinton called an emergency conference call with defense and State Department officials to discuss how to get Americans out of harm's way, the Washington Post reports. According to the final House Benghazi report released today, the call focused heavily on how and why the attack happened\u2014and half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting didn't have to do with evacuation. The call also brought up concerns about whether Marines might have been sent to Benghazi if they hadn't already changed in and out of their uniforms four times as they prepared to deploy, the New York Times reports. A \u2013 The House Benghazi committee is out with its final report on the 2012 attack on the US mission in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, and one nugget in particular is getting a lot of attention: The panel found that the State Department's initial response to the attack\u2014that it was a spontaneous protest gone wrong\u2014was based on \"inaccurate, incomplete, and sometimes misleading information,\" reports the Washington Post. Specifically, the report says the department didn't tell the public that the attack was a protest over an anti-Islam video until almost an hour after it began. The report also says the military never deployed to Benghazi because \u2013 The State Department has identified the three Americans killed in yesterday's attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as Ambassador Chris Stevens, security officer Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods, the 18-year-old son of actor Sean Smith. Woods' family released a statement today saying they were \"devastated\" by his death, reports the New York Times. \"Our hearts go out to his family, friends, and all of those who lost their lives in this horrific attack,\" said the statement. \"We ask that you please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.\" The other two victims have been identified as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula \u2013 The White House has backtracked on its initial assertion that the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi wasn't the result of a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islam video, the New York Times reports. \"It is becoming increasingly clear that the series of events in Benghazi was much more terrorist attack than a protest which escalated into violence,\" press secretary Jay Carney said today, adding that the White House wants \"to distinguish, not conflate, the events in other countries with this well-planned attack by militant extremists.\" The latest back-and-forth comes as the House Intelligence Committee holds a hearing today on the consulate attack, and \u2013 The White House has been under fire for its initial response to the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, with critics accusing it of misleading the public about the nature of the violence. Now the New York Times is out with a scathing analysis that accuses the administration of giving the public the false impression that the violence was the result of a protest over an anti-Islam video. \"The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack\u2014from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi,\" writes the Times. \"Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to \u2013 Newt Gingrich today laid into Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration for \"stonewalling\" witnesses in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. In an op-ed in the New York Times, he lays out a series of events that he says show the White House \"ignored or deliberately tried to hide\" evidence of a protest at the US consulate in Libya that led to the deaths of US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Among other things, he accuses the administration of misleading the public about the nature of the protests and of its response. \"The White House was well aware at the time that an anti-Islam video \u2013 The top Democrat on the House Benghazi panel calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in in my 20 years in Congress.\" The panel released its long-awaited report on the 2012 attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans on Tuesday, concluding that Hillary Clinton and other officials didn't do enough to prevent it, the New York Times reports. \"We've been locked out of so many things,\" Rep. Elijah Cummings tells MSNBC. \"Witnesses interviewed and we're not told about it. Exculpatory evidence found out by the Republicans they don't tell us about it.\" Cummings",

    "document": "The BBC's State Department Correspondent Kim Ghattas gets behind-the-scenes access to Hillary Clinton on a recent diplomatic trip overseas. \n \n For Assignment the BBC's State Department Correspondent Kim Ghattas has gained rare behind-the-scenes access to one of Hillary Clinton's recent overseas trips. \n \n Join her on \"special air mission 883\" as it heads from the US to the Middle East and Africa. \n \n Expect surprising insights and unguarded moments with aides, officials and the special protection team as they try - and sometimes fail - to control the messy world around them. \n \n Get up close and personal with the American Secretary of State in this week's Assignment. ||||| QUESTION: I know it\u2019s a strange question, but may I ask you to start by introducing yourself to BBC listeners? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: I am Hillary Rodham Clinton. I\u2019m the 67th Secretary of State for the United States of America, serving in the Administration of President Barack Obama. \n \n QUESTION: Okay. We\u2019re in Dubai because we had a little problem with your plane. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes. \n \n QUESTION: Now, what does that say \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 about American power, because it\u2019s not the first time your plane breaks down? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I think it says that we prioritize. So the President\u2019s plane, Air Force One, is absolutely impeccable. Our fighter jets are the best in the world. Others of our Air Force are first-rate. But I think there\u2019s a long line ahead of the plane that I\u2019m in, which I share with the Vice President and other high officials. So we\u2019ve had our ups and downs, as you might say, with this airplane. \n \n QUESTION: On the other hand, you actually have an airplane that you can commandeer to go wherever you want when needed. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: That\u2019s exactly right. So I have no complaints. And if we were to just chart the hundreds of thousands of miles that I have traveled, the mechanical problems, or in the case of volcanic ash clouds or rocks on runways, have been relatively few. \n \n QUESTION: Does the plane feel like a home away from home, an office with wings? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: It feels like an office, not a home, because it is an office. It has secure communications, it has a very able civilian and military team, we get a lot of work done on the plane, but it\u2019s a little challenging jet lag-wise, mileage, dehydration, all of the problems that come with spending a lot of time in the air. So I am always happy to be home once we finally land. \n \n QUESTION: How do you handle jet lag? I mean, I travel with \u2013 I\u2019ve traveled with you quite a bit, and at the end of the trips, I\u2019m exhausted and I take a few days off. You go back to the office the next day. How do you do it? Do you do yoga, a special diet, what\u2019s the secret? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I sleep a lot on the plane. I know that some people think you should stay up for a certain period of time and not sleep on certain legs, but since I am perpetually tired, I figure make up for the lost hours of sleep while flying. Also, I know very simple things \u2013 drink a lot of water, deep breathing, try to get a little bit of sunshine if you can every day. But I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any magic formula. Because I, too, often am tired; there\u2019s no doubt about it. But I\u2019m exhilarated at the same time. I love what we\u2019re doing, I\u2019m honored to represent our country everywhere we go, and I feel like we are making a difference. So that is enough to keep me going. \n \n QUESTION: I want to take you back to our stop in Shannon when we were on our way here. You took me outside to talk to those two Irish guys. Tell me about them. You seemed to have a very nice conversation with them. Are they always there to welcome you when you land? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: They work at the airport, so they and a few others are usually always there. They\u2019re combination security and welcoming, and I have gotten to talk with them over the years, stopping, going from Shannon. And I love Ireland, so it was great because we were there while it was still light out, and actually, I had slept till about five minutes before we were going to take off again. So I wanted to get a little air and a little bit of sun, and they kindly accommodated me. \n \n QUESTION: When we travel with you, we are in what is known apparently as the bubble. How would you describe the bubble? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I don\u2019t think of it so much as a bubble. I think of it as more of a caravan going from place to place, and sometimes the dogs bark, but we still move on. And it is for me a moveable adventure. No day is the same, in part because the places, the issues, the leaders, the people, the food are enough different still in our increasingly interconnected world that there\u2019s always something new to see or hear about or discover. But it is true that when we\u2019re traveling, we are focused on where we have been, are, and intend to go. So a lot of what happens back in the United States has to take second priority to what we are actually focused on. But there is no escaping the constant stream of paper, which is never ending. And I keep up with that on the road. So I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m cut off in any way. I assume it would have been quite challenging, but such different times you would not maybe have noticed, 50 or 100 years ago when travel was much slower, communication was either so slow or nonexistent. So we live in this 24/7 media environment. So I\u2019m always kept up to date, but I try to keep my attention on what we\u2019re doing. \n \n QUESTION: But do you ever wish you could break free of the caravan and go explore on your own? Where would you go? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I do wish that, and I\u2019ve been fortunate because I\u2019ve traveled before this current job where I had the opportunity to explore, wander, walk anonymously, and even in \u2013 \n \n QUESTION: Anonymously? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Anonymously in those days. (Laughter.) That was a long time ago. So I would have felt very sad if I hadn\u2019t had that experience before I \u2013 before my husband was president, certainly before I was a first lady, a senator, or a secretary. I went to a lot of places, and that gave me a familiarity. But even on these trips in the last two and a half years or so, every once in a while I will go for a walk and just get away. I remember when we were in Wellington, New Zealand and we were on the water, and there was a great walkway. I walked for probably an hour, and it\u2019s just so rejuvenating to me. It\u2019s my favorite thing to do. So I don\u2019t get enough time to do that, but I try to fit it in. \n \n QUESTION: If I\u2019m not mistaken, your Secret Service code when you were first lady was Evergreen, and it\u2019s stayed. And in hindsight, it\u2019s quite a fitting name \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 because you\u2019ve renewed yourself, reinvented yourself so often and so well. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Apparently \u2013 well, apparently so. I had no choice. I was just given the name. My husband was Eagle. My daughter was Energy. And I think those are all fitting code names. But I have been lucky. I\u2019ve been so fortunate to have been given these opportunities in my life over the course of a long time now. And I never take it for granted. I\u2019m never complacent about it. I\u2019m always energized by it because I think it\u2019s important. I think the work that we\u2019re trying to do, especially in this time of such tumultuous change, is going to set the template for the rest of this century. \n \n QUESTION: It is a very tumultuous time in the Arab world and in many other places, and you have to meet a lot of leaders around the world. Some of them you like; some of them perhaps you like a little bit less. What is it like to have to shake hands with an autocrat, with somebody whose values you don\u2019t really share? It can\u2019t be easy to smile for the cameras all the time. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: It isn\u2019t, and I have had to do it quite a bit over the course of the last 20 years. But I try to remember why I\u2019m there and why I\u2019m doing it. The United States has relationships with every country just about. There are a few exceptions that we don\u2019t, obviously, but we are everywhere in the world, and we have a great mission to protect our security and advance our interests and promote our values. We see that very clearly. So with some you can work on all three, and some you can work on two or one of the three, and we\u2019re always looking for those moments. I also try to be sensitive to the historical, experiential, cultural, religious, social differences that exist that make life so intriguing on this planet we share. But there have been times when I have left a meeting or an encounter, and it\u2019s been very difficult to smile for the cameras, as you say. But some of what you do you do because of the goal that you are trying to achieve. And you cannot get from point A to point B without working with leaders and regimes that you don\u2019t have much in common with or, frankly, who you disagree rather significantly with. \n \n QUESTION: When a foreign minister travels to a foreign country, they\u2019re usually \u2013 they usually only get to meet their direct counterparts, the foreign minister of that country. When an American secretary of state travels, when you travel, you get to meet with presidents and kings. Why is that? What does it say about America? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I think it says a lot about America and about our great reach and the relationships that we have. I also know many of these people from my prior incarnations, so I have personal relationships with them, which I have certainly called upon in this role. So I find it very helpful to meet with, as you say, kings, presidents, and prime ministers. \n \n QUESTION: But they also open the doors to you. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, they do. \n \n QUESTION: They wouldn\u2019t do that for the foreign minister of another country, for example. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I can\u2019t speak to that, but I know that because of my prior relationships, which are often on a long-standing personal basis, they would see me under any circumstances. They saw me when I was a senator, they saw me when I was a First Lady, so they continue to see me in my current role, and then I do think that as Secretary of State of the United States, there is a lot of business to be done, and some of that business is not only in the foreign ministry. \n \n QUESTION: What\u2019s your favorite story from your time \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as a secretary of state? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh, Kim. I have too many. I\u2019ll probably save them for my next book if I ever get around to writing it, but there have been wonderful moments, and then there have been moments of high comedy and even some quite difficult times. But the few times when I really feel like we\u2019re making a difference are the best times because for me it\u2019s mostly about the work when I travel. I mean, I don\u2019t try to think too much about what else is happening, and I haven\u2019t had too many difficult experiences. So I\u2019m not looking back on it and rolling my eyes or anything, but I think I\u2019ll probably wait until I can really think that through. Certainly, the last time I was in South Africa, getting to see Nelson Mandela, which for me has always been important personally, was very gratifying because he\u2019s an international treasure. But there\u2019s too many stories to tell. \n \n QUESTION: And what was your biggest challenge or your worst moment? I mean, we\u2019ve been on some very interesting trips. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, you have. I think that first trip to Asia was maybe one of the most consequential because there was a feeling in Asia that the United States had abandoned its role as a Pacific power, and that\u2019s why I decided to go, but we did not know what would await us. And I heard a lot from the leaders there about our economic crisis, the global recession, whether the United States was going to remain a player in the region. So that very first trip for me was a real baptism by fire, so to speak. \n \n QUESTION: You were practically mobbed by adoring fans, and you were greeted like a rock star everywhere. Two and a half years into your job, do you think people still look at you as a rock star, a celebrity, or do they see you more as part of the Obama Administration? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: That\u2019s a great question. I actually think it\u2019s both. I mean, I was just walking through the mall here and had some young women come up and shout at me and tell me how much they appreciated me. And I think for young women and not so young women, there is a connection. They know that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on women\u2019s issues and they care about what I\u2019m doing and what it might mean for them. So I still encounter that a lot. And so that\u2019s kind of my independent role. But also as someone who ran against Barack Obama, and you\u2019ve heard me say, ran very hard and didn\u2019t make it, but then supported him and much to my amazement was asked to be Secretary of State. That is a very powerful story around the world. \n \n I started telling that story on that first trip to Asia, and I could see people just nodding, little light bulbs of thinking and recognition going off about, oh yeah, that did happen there, and we have politics where basically we try to kill each other. And so people do see me connected with the Obama Administration. I often encounter very positive personal responses in the town halls, the townterviews kind of programs that we do, and then an interviewer or an audience member will mention President Obama\u2019s name and people will break into applause. So I think there\u2019s still a very good feeling about what the President and what this Administration are trying to do. \n \n QUESTION: Do you ever wake up in the morning think, oh, I\u2019m too tired to go to work today? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: I really don\u2019t. I wake up and say I\u2019m tired so I better get up and get going. But no, every day is fascinating to me because I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen during the day. I am very aware of how much energy this takes because, clearly, it\u2019s a nonstop marathon. But let me knock on wood here, I have been lucky with health, stamina, and all that goes with it. So no, I won\u2019t lie to you. I\u2019m tired. My friends call and email saying, \u201cOh, my gosh, I saw you on television. You looked so tired.\u201d (Laughter.) Which I send back saying, \u201cGee, thanks a lot.\u201d But I know, because if you work around the clock like we do, that\u2019s just inevitable. So I do try to take some time, long weekends, take some deep breathing. I do exercise, yoga, those kinds of things. But no, I\u2019m never tired about the work. It\u2019s just the physical challenge. \n \n QUESTION: You have an incredible amount of people you know around the world. You must have the biggest Rolodex in town. (Laughter.) How many contacts do you have in your Blackberry that you can just call up like that? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, thousands. Really, thousands. And it\u2019s the right kind of contacts, because they are people who have some connection with me. \n \n QUESTION: Somebody\u2019s calling you right now. (Laughter.) \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Somebody\u2019s calling me right now, so if somebody else will, I hope, answer it and see what they want. But that \u2013 you timed that question. Is that one of your colleagues calling and saying, \u201cOh, my goodness\u201d? \n \n I\u2019m lucky. I know a lot of people. Now, they\u2019re not close friends, but I have become friends with a number of the leaders with whom I do work. And I have found over this 20 years of high-wire American and international activity, people do not end up in the positions they hold by accident. There is a reason. Even in authoritarian, dictatorial systems, there is something that has set them apart. And it\u2019s always fascinating for me to figure it out. Because from afar, you can say how did that person end up as prime minister, president, whatever? But then you work with them and you \u2013 and there\u2019s an intelligence there, there\u2019s a savvyness, there\u2019s a sense of survival. It\u2019s really, for me, not just diplomatic. It\u2019s political, psychological. \n \n I remember very well when \u2013 on my first trip to Africa and I went to Kenya, and it was shortly after they\u2019d had this terrible violence after their prior election, and I delivered a really tough message. And they were taken aback by it, but I felt strongly that here was a country that had so much going for it. And we slowly saw some changes. I had very open, honest conversations with some of the leaders there. The President followed up because, of course, his deep interest in Kenya, with his father. And then two years later, we were at a democracy conference in Poland, and Kenya had been invited. They had taken some rather significant steps, including reforming their constitution. And the spokesman who came from the government started off by saying to me \u2013 I was in the audience \u2013 that you came and you really spoke very truthfully to us, and we have tried very hard to change. And that\u2019s worth it to me. That\u2019s worth all the travel. \n \n I have no illusions about how hard this is to create strong democracies, to build free market economies, to stand against a culture of corruption, and all of the things that I talk about endlessly. But when I see progress being made against the odds, I say okay, this is really worth it, because we\u2019ve been at independence for 235 years this year. We\u2019ve had our own ups and downs and our own difficulties, including a civil war and so much else. But it\u2019s the intention and it\u2019s the direction. And when I see positive intentions matched with a commitment to a path that could lead in a positive direction, I just am going to stand up and say hooray, and the United States will be with you, we\u2019ll support you, we\u2019ll do everything we can to help you. \n \n QUESTION: You are still very popular, both in the United States and abroad. In fact, I think you\u2019re skyrocketing in polls. But some of your critics say that they can\u2019t quite put their finger on what it is that you are trying to achieve as a Secretary of State. What is the issue that you are trying to get your hands on and bring to fruition? Is it Middle East peace? Is it Afghanistan? Is it Pakistan? What is \u2013 what do you want to be remembered for as Secretary of State? \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: I don\u2019t see it that way, especially at this time. I think there are so many converging challenges that are interconnected in ways that we could not have imagined 25, 50 years ago, that what we\u2019re trying to do is restore America\u2019s leadership in the world, because I fervently believe American leadership is essential for the promotion of human rights and dignity, freedom, economic opportunity. \n \n And I am well aware that for the years prior to this Administration, there were a lot of questions about what we were doing. And of course, there are those who say, well, history will look back and see Iraq as a great success, and I hope that\u2019s the case. But I think much of what we did was because we were attacked on 9/11, and I think we made fiscal and budgetary decisions that undermined America\u2019s strength at home and abroad. \n \n So what we\u2019re trying to do, and what I am personally am committed to doing, is moving on a very steady path toward restoring America\u2019s influence and leadership. That\u2019s why going to Asia was important. That\u2019s why continuing to pay attention to Latin America and Africa, working with regional institutions that can espouse the same values that we think are the best way to live and for societies to flourish. \n \n Now, when I took this job, people said, well, you can either try to do that or you can pick one or two or three things. I don\u2019t think this is a time to pick one or two or three things. And I\u2019m well aware of \u2013 others might well choose a different perspective, but that\u2019s how I see what I\u2019m doing. \n \n QUESTION: Do you think you are on the right track in terms of restoring American leadership? Some people argue that, in the Middle East, America is becoming irrelevant. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: I just don\u2019t believe that for a minute. I think that it\u2019s nothing we can take for granted. We can\u2019t be complacent and we certainly can\u2019t walk away. I have fought hard within the Administration for a significant economic program for both Egypt and Tunisia, because I think that the revolution of expectations in both countries was as much economic as political, because it wasn\u2019t only the freedom to vote or the freedom to speak, but the freedom to work and to increase your standard of living and to see your life improve. \n \n And I think that we are still looked to, sometimes begrudgingly and critically, but there is no doubt in my mind that people still care very much what the United States says and does. And what I worry about is the contrary, that it\u2019s not what people around the world think about our role, but at home people who rightly are concerned about our own domestic economic situation, our own federal budget deficit, who are saying enough with the foreign involvements; let\u2019s just do nothing but stay right here and tend to our own garden. That would be, in my view, a great mistake. \n \n So part of what I\u2019m trying to do is speak and work on behalf of America\u2019s influence and leadership in a way that my own country understands, so that people who are unemployed auto workers in Michigan or struggling small businesspeople in California can say, \u201cYeah, I really want the President, the government, to pay attention to me, but I get it. I know why we\u2019re working to make sure Egypt and Tunisia turn out well. I know why we still put money into developing agriculture and fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa, and all the other things that we are working on.\u201d \n \n QUESTION: And a final question, to wrap up on a lighter note. Tell us something about yourself that BBC listeners don\u2019t know. (Laughter.) \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I sometimes think I\u2019m the best-known unknown person. I\u2019m always amazed when people \u2013 and sometimes interviewers but sometimes just citizens around the world \u2013 will say something to me about me that I think, well, no, I didn\u2019t do that or I didn\u2019t say that or I don\u2019t like that. So I\u2019m always amused by that. But there\u2019s \u2013 look, I don\u2019t think anybody in the public eye can ever be totally known. That\u2019s a misnomer, even though people are constantly in the press and therefore, you think you know them. \n \n But I think that I am a pretty normal, average person, despite all of the hype. And I am very interested in spending time with my friends and my family and not being on the merry-go-round all the time, which is one of the reasons why I have decided that I will move on and return to private life at the end of what will be a very intense period of activity and work in the next 18 months. But I just \u2013 I believe what I say and I work to try to see life improve, particularly for women and girls, and I love what I\u2019m doing. \n \n QUESTION: I think one thing that people don\u2019t know about you is that you have a great sense of humor. (Laughter.) You (inaudible) I think. \n \n SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, you\u2019ve got to have a little bit of fun doing these kinds of jobs, Kim, as you know. And thank you for all of your good work. \n \n QUESTION: Thank you.",

    "document": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Japanese workers often spend a lot of time with colleagues even after leaving the office \n \n Death from overwork in Japan is such a longstanding problem it even has its own word, \"karoshi\". \n \n Now the government and business groups are trying to get workers to take a small step to reclaim their lives by leaving work early one day a month. \n \n The scheme, dubbed \"Premium Friday\", suggests companies make staff go home at 15:00 on the last Friday of the month, starting in February. \n \n It has been given renewed impetus by the suicide of a woman who was working more than 100 hours overtime a month at Japan's biggest ad agency, Dentsu. \n \n Her death was ruled to be a case of \"karoshi\" and has led to an investigation, an announcement the firm's chief executive will resign and deep concern in Japan at the country's work culture. \n \n But with around 2,000 deaths a year linked to overwork, few believe the voluntary scheme represents anything more than a small step towards changing attitudes and it is unclear how many companies will take it up. \n \n Image copyright Premium Friday Image caption Premium Friday has its own logo \n \n It is not the first time overwork has been seen as a problem nor the first time anyone has tried to do something about it. \n \n Among other initiatives, the government has in the past tried to make employees take more of the leave they are entitled to - Japan's labour ministry says they only take about half - without much success. \n \n The number of public holidays in Japan this year increased to 16 in part aimed at forcing people to take breaks. \n \n The government has also tried to encourage more flexible hours, allowing government workers to start and leave work early in the summer and even switching off the lights in some offices late in the evening, something Dentsu is also now trying. \n \n Workers are increasingly taking the initiative to go home on time some days too, even announcing it on social media to encourage others to do the same. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The death of a Dentsu employee has focused attention on a longstanding problem \n \n But while this has helped change the idea that working excessive overtime is necessarily a good thing, none has had a made much of a dent in the hours themselves. \n \n Around 22% of the population work more than 49 hours a week according to 2014 figures from the Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training, behind South Korea at 35% but ahead of the US, where 16% of workers put in those kind of hours. \n \n Why change? \n \n For the government and business groups, there is an element of self-interest too. \n \n Japan's economy has stagnated for more than two decades. The situation has been made worse by low consumption spending and a very low birth rate, both of which are aggravated by workers spending most of their waking hours at a desk. \n \n Productivity and efficiency also suffer from firms having staff perpetually on hand, as companies don't invest in labour-saving technologies. \n \n Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, told the BBC that private consumption could rise by as much as 124 billion yen ($1bn; \u00a3860m) every Premium Friday if \"100%\" of those eligible headed home at 3pm on those days. \n \n But he stresses no one knows how many people will take up the idea and that total participation is unlikely, which could mean a much smaller boost to the economy. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Maybe next time dad can come too - increasing family time is one goal \n \n Why would companies and workers not take part? Well, being first to make such a change could be painful. \n \n Companies face higher costs and Japanese workers often feel guilty at leaving their colleagues behind. \n \n \"Japanese workers worry about letting down their colleagues\" says Mr Nagahama. \"They have a strong sense of working as a team.\" \n \n Having employees work less is especially difficult for Japan's many small businesses, which are battling to keep costs down. The fact that many of them are family-run makes an early walk-out even trickier. \n \n Even with Premium Friday, Mr Nagahama points out some employees may make up the time on other days or even do other jobs in their newly-gained leisure time, which would nullify the point of the scheme. \n \n It is not even clear if the government ministry behind the idea will be participating, though Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko has reportedly promised that he will not have appointments after 15:00 on those Fridays. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption The rare sight of office workers enjoying themselves while it is still light could become more common \n \n Despite doubts about the scheme, supporters hope the modest goal of an early finish once a month combined with the backing of government and industry will encourage uptake, and eventually more fundamental change in workplace culture. \n \n The campaign is also promoting commercial opportunities for restaurants, shops, travel companies and other businesses who could benefit, in the hope that firms will see the benefit of increased leisure time for employees. \n \n Of course, changing deeply-rooted attitudes to work will be difficult. Many previous attempts have failed. But ironically the effort might be helped by Japanese workers' declining corporate loyalty. \n \n Cut adrift by years of restructuring from the lifetime employment bargain that bound their fathers to a single firm, younger Japanese people may find that the chance to head to the izakaya (pub) a bit earlier some Fridays is just the nudge they need to adopt a better work-life balance. \n \n Reporting by Simeon Paterson. ||||| The country that coined the word karoshi (death by overwork) wants companies to let workers finish early on the last Friday of every month so that they can go out and have fun. \n \n In an effort to curb excessive work hours and to spur consumption, the government and business groups will launch the Premium Friday campaign on Feb. 24. \n \n Although it\u2019s unknown how many companies will participate, the nation\u2019s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, is encouraging its more than 1,300 member companies to take part. \n \n One indication of just how tough it is to get change in Japan\u2019s rigid work practices: the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is pushing the idea, hasn\u2019t decided yet if its officials will get to join in. \n \n However, METI chief Hiroshige Seko said, \u201cI\u2019m giving my secretaries a strict order not to put in any appointments after 3 p.m.\u201d on the first Premium Friday. \n \n There\u2019s a clear relationship between leisure time, holidays and spending, said Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. If most workers, including those at small and medium-size firms participate, private consumption could rise by about \u00a5124 billion on each Premium Friday, according to his calculations. \n \n That may provide some boost to private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the economy. \n \n However, Nagahama said he is concerned workers at smaller companies may have difficulty leaving early, or that they will simply have to make the time up on other days, limiting the campaign\u2019s impact. \n \n Japanese workers typically use just half of their annual paid leave entitlements. In part to work around this problem and enforce time away from work, Japan has 16 annual public holidays, more than countries including the U.S. and France. ||||| Japan\u2019s work culture is notoriously punishing. This is, after all, the country that coined the phrase karoshi, or death by overwork. \n \n A much trumpeted labor initiative doesn\u2019t look as though it\u2019s going to change things very much, either. Beginning Feb. 24, the Japanese government and participating business groups will launch the \u201cPremium Friday\u201d campaign to let people leave the office a couple of hours early \u2014 but not every Friday. Just the last Friday of each month, Bloomberg reports. \n \n The scheme is not mandatory, either, so it is unclear how many enterprises will actually take part. The Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) has encouraged its members to sign up, but they comprise a mere 1,300 companies. (There are well over 2.5 million registered businesses in Japan according to figures from 2006.) \n \n Even the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is promoting \u201cPremium Friday,\u201d has not signaled if its staff will participate. \n \n \u201cPremium Friday\u201d comes at a time when karoshi is back in the spotlight. Earlier this week, the head of Japan\u2019s biggest ad agency Dentsu (dentsu-inc) resigned over the suicide of Matsuri Takahashi, a young employee who leaped to her death in December 2015 after becoming depressed from overwork. \n \n \u201cDeath by overwork should never happen. I ask executives to take effective measures to redress (the situation.)\u201d said Keidanren chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara following Takahashi\u2019s suicide, Japan\u2019s Kyodo news agency reports. \n \n For more on death by overwork, watch Fortune\u2019s video: \n \n According to 2014 figures from the Japan Institute For Labor Policy, Japan has the highest percentage of workers working over 49 hours per week among the G-7 nations. However data from the Japan Productivity Center indicates that the country also has the worst productivity among the group. \n \n \u201cJapan is still a country where working long hours is considered a virtue,\u201d said Kazunari Tamaki, a lawyer who specializes in karoshi told Japan\u2019s Kyodo. \u201cBut we need to focus on improving efficiency within fixed hours to boost productivity.\u201d \n \n Unfortunately, with schemes like \u201cPremium Friday\u201d that\u2019s unlikely to happen any time soon.",

As the Japan Times notes, there's even a word for it: \"karoshi,\" or \"death by overwork.\" Now Japan is designating the last Friday of every month as \"Premium Friday,\" with employees encouraged to sign out at 3pm\u2014and maybe do a little shopping to jump-start their weekend and possibly a lagging economy, reports the London Times. The move isn't mandatory for companies, but the nation's biggest business lobby is on board and encouraging its members to take part when it launches on Feb. 24. It doesn't help that most workers in Japan tend to use only half their allotted paid time off, and that an estimated one in eight work 50 hours or more\u2014the highest percentage among G-7 nations. So it remains unclear whether Premium Friday will be a sufficient break for the overworked, or even attainable for those who must squeeze in their work at other times. Fortune is skeptical, calling it an \"essentially meaningless\" scheme. It quotes a critic who says the bigger issue to focus on is efficiency to cut down on those long work weeks, which are \"still considered a virtue.\" Another problem is that Japan has lots of small, family-run businesses where shortened hours could be a problem, notes the BBC.

That means burning recycled wood and trash, including clothes H&M can\u2019t sell. \n \n \u201cFor us it\u2019s a burnable material,\u201d said Jens Neren, head of fuel supplies at Malarenergi AB, a utility which owns and operates the 54-year-old plant about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Stockholm. \u201cOur goal is to use only renewable and recycled fuels.\u201d \n \n While Sweden prides itself on an almost entirely emission free-power system thanks to its hydro, nuclear and wind plants, some local municipalities still use coal and oil to heat homes and offices during cold winter days. By converting old plants to burn biofuels and garbage, the biggest Nordic economy is hoping to edge out the last of its fossil fuel units by the end of this decade. \n \n Malarenergi has a deal with the neighboring city of Eskilstuna to burn their trash, some of which comes from H&M\u2019s central warehouse in the same city. The refuse wasn\u2019t specified as clothing until it was highlighted in a Swedish national television program on Tuesday. \n \n \u201cH&M does not burn any clothes that are safe to use,\u201d Johanna Dahl, head of communications for H&M in Sweden, said by email. \u201cHowever it is our legal obligation to make sure that clothes that contain mold or do not comply with our strict restriction on chemicals are destroyed.\u201d \n \n The Vasteras plant burned about 15 tons of discarded clothes from H&M so far in 2017, compared with about 400,000 tons of trash, Neren said. Malarenergi has deals with several nearby cities to receive rubbish and even imports waste from Britain to fuel its main boiler. \n \n The facility, which supplies power to about 150,000 households, burned as much as 650,000 tons of coal at its peak in 1996. \n \n On Tuesday, the last coal ship docked in Vasteras to supply the plant\u2019s two remaining fossil-fuel generators from the 1960s with enough supplies to last until 2020. That\u2019s when a new wood-fired boiler will be added to supplement the facility\u2019s existing biofuel and trash burning units. ||||| Nearly 100% of all used clothing and household textiles can be re-used or recycled: 45% are re-used as apparel; 30% are converted into industrial polishing/wiping cloths and 20% are processed into fiber to be manufactured into new products. 95% of all used clothing is recyclable, only 5% is unusable due to mildew or other contamination. \n \n Companies in the textile reuse and recycling industry consist of collectors, processors and distributors of all types of used clothing, textiles and secondary materials. \n \n Collectors are companies that collect used clothing and other household textiles from the public. In addition, recycled textile collectors gather materials from industrial laundries, healthcare institutions, hotels, and other businesses that utilize large amounts of textile products. Another source of textile products that is directed into the recycling stream by \"collector\" companies is textile waste from clothing manufacturers. \n \n Collectors bale and sell these clothing products \"as is\" to clothing graders or other dealers. Used clothing \"graders\" sort the items assign a \"grade\" and re-sell the graded product. The activities of collectors, graders, and used clothing brokers are instrumental in diverting solid waste from landfills. \n \n Processors sort, grade and reprocess used clothing and household textiles during the recycling process. At the facilities where the collected clothing and textiles are sorted, the items are then made into large bales to be re-sold. The newly created bales of used clothing may be re-sold within the United States, although most often the products are shipped overseas to developing markets in Asia, Africa, Europe, or Central and South America. \n \n Textile processors also collect items from industrial laundries that are deemed to be unfit to be used by the laundry's clients. These items are sorted and bleached to make them more absorbent before they are cut into wiping cloths. \n \n Some companies re-process used clothing back into their original fiber. These companies create blends of fiber that are sold in bales to companies that re-manufacture the fiber content into new products. These products include: home insulation (made from the denim of reprocessed blue jeans), stuffing for furniture, athletic equipment, pet bedding, automotive soundproofing, and carpet padding among many other new products. \n \n Distributors take the used clothing or textiles that are cut or converted into wiping products and then sold to industrial, manufacturing, retail, and other end-use clients. Broker companies fall within the distributor category as well. These businesses facilitate the transactions between collector companies, grader companies and buyers. Materials that are brokered within the used clothing industry include institutional mixed used clothing, clothing gathered by collector companies and materials that have been sorted by grader companies. The clients of brokers are often foreign businesses located in Africa, Asia, Europe, or South America. On occasion, brokers also facilitate transactions among companies within the United States, depending on the needs of their client companies. ||||| A Swedish power plant that aims to eliminate the use of fossil fuels by 2020 has taken to burning recycled wood and garbage\u2014including clothes from H&M;\u2019s central warehouse, as first reported on Swedish public television. \n \n \u201cFor us it\u2019s a burnable material,\u201d said Jens Neren, head of fuel supplies at Malarenergi AB, which owns and operates the plant in Vasteras, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Stockholm. \u201cOur goal is to use only renewable and recycled fuels.\u201d \n \n According to Bloomberg, the plant has burned about 15 tons of discarded clothing from H&M; so far in 2017, making it a minuscule percentage of the 400,000 tons of trash it has burned to supply power to about 150,000 households. The clothes, according to H&M;\u2019s head of communications, Johanna Dahl, are burned because they\u2019re unsafe for wearing. \n \n \u201cIt is our legal obligation to make sure that clothes that contain mold or do not comply with our strict restriction on chemicals are destroyed,\u201d Dahl told Bloomberg.\u201cH&M; does not burn any clothes that are safe to use.\u201d \n \n While Sweden is a leader in eliminating the use of fossil fuels, the fast fashion cycle encouraged by brands such as H&M; is far from sustainable, as 15 tons of discarded clothing from a single warehouse would indicate. \n \n Beyond the staggering resources required to produce H&M;\u2019s hundreds of millions of products globally each year, fast fashion encourages an environmentally catastrophic cycle that sees manufacturers producing ever-increasing quantities to meet rising demands in markets such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Russia. According to a 2016 McKinsey study, clothing production worldwide doubled between 2010 and 2014, and from 2000 to 2011 the average number of annual collections produced by European apparel companies rose from two to five. \n \n It\u2019s a lot of material for one planet to handle. Plus, when clothes are so cheap, customers value them less, making them even likelier to end up in landfills\u2014if they\u2019re not in an incinerator first. \n \n \ud83c\udf0d Quartz is running a series called The Race to Zero Emissions that addresses the challenges and opportunities of climate action.

While almost half of donated clothing gets worn again, a large portion of it is recycled in the traditional sense\u2014ground down and re-formed into things like insulation and carpet padding\u2014and a slightly smaller portion is turned into industrial rags. \n \n Figuring out the proper way to dispose of old clothes can be perplexing; if these bins were to be taken off the sidewalks, few people would know where to put their used clothing. On top of that, Americans still think of old clothes as charitable donations, which explains the outrage over news that the Viltex bins actually belong to a for-profit company. \n \n Those in the textile-recycling industry are now trying to clear up the confusion. \"What we need to do is change the dialogue to, 'You're not just donating, you're reusing and recycling,'\" says Jackie King, executive director of the Secondhand Materials and Recycled Textiles Association, a trade group. \"It's an issue of communicating that and getting people to understand that if they want to use a charitable organization to reuse or recycle clothing, great. If not, let's make it convenient for people to dispose of it elsewhere.\" \n \n Most recycling, from bottles to cans to newspapers, is done by for-profit companies. In a nation that churns out an ungodly amount of waste, this amounts to big business. Take plastic: The U.S. exported more than $940 million worth of plastic scrap in 2010. The value of used clothing, moreover, has been in its own inflationary bubble since the recession, as more people are cash-strapped and opting to buy used. \n \n Of course, castoff clothing differs from a bottle or a newspaper in that almost half of it can be reused as secondhand clothing; it needn't be ground down into a pulp to make a new product, as is the case with plastic or glass. But the other half\u2014the ripped, the torn, the busted\u2014is recyclable. \n \n Charities have been our de facto national textile recyclers going back to the early 20th century, and Goodwill started providing bins for clothing donations as early as the 1940s. But this system was set up in a pre-consumerist America, when we had neither a landfill crunch nor a waste crisis: Americans now buy five times as much clothing as they did in 1980, according to Mattias Wallander, CEO of USAgain, a textile-recycling company. And between 1999 and 2009, the volume of textile trash rose by 40 percent. Particularly due to the advent of cheap, disposable clothing, charities have seen themselves transformed into dumps that accept clothes of varying condition in ever-increasing volumes. \n \n King says there is quite a lot of public misinformation about what exactly happens to clothing when it\u2019s donated to charities. \"People think when they are giving to, say, a Salvation Army or Goodwill, that all of that is going to be resold in their stores, and it's just not, because they don't have enough room for that,\" she says. In fact, according to King, there's only a 15 or 20 percent chance that a piece of clothing you've donated is being worn by someone in your community, as charities receive far too many donations to sell them all.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 H&M's fashions are on fire\u2014literally, that is, in Vasteras, Sweden. A heat and power station that powers 150,000 homes there has a mandate to stop burning fossil fuels like coal and oil by 2020. Its path to achieving that involves burning \"only renewable and recycled fuels,\" which in its case, includes recycled wood and \"trash\" from an H&M warehouse in the neighboring city of Eskilstuna. Bloomberg reports it was only last week that the trash was specified as clothing, and a rep for H&M in Sweden explains the company \"does not burn any clothes that are safe to use.\" What's being torched\u2014year to date, about 30,000 pounds' worth\u2014are ones that may \"contain mold or do not comply with our strict restriction on chemicals.\" The alternative would seemingly be a landfill, which is where a staggering amount of our clothing ends up. The Atlantic in 2014 reported that Americans toss about 10.5 million tons of clothing a year. That's about 85% of what we get rid of, with the other 15% recycled\u2014either ultimately worn by someone else, turned into industrial rags, or \"ground down\" and repurposed as items ranging from insulation and furniture stuffing to pet bedding, per the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association. The Sourcing Journal cites the Environmental Protection Agency's concern over the situation: The agency recorded a 38% jump in textile waste between 2000 and 2011. Quartz points to a 2016 McKinsey study that found that over that same period, European clothing companies increased their number of annual collections from two to five.",

That's because, as King explains, charities receive far too many donations of cheap, disposable clothing to be able to sell them all. In fact, she says, only about 20% of donated clothing is actually being worn by someone in your community.

The fashion retailer's warehouse in Eskilstuna is the site of the country's largest trash-burning operation, which has so far burned some 400,000 tons of trash this year, compared to about 15 tons from H&M, reports the Local. The clothes are being burned as part of a project to make the 54-year-old Vasteras power plant fossil-free by 2020. \"For us it's a burnable material,\" says a rep for Malarenergi, the utility that owns and operates the plant. \"Our goal is to use only renewable and recycled fuels.\" The coal- and oil-fired plant used to burn as much as 650,000 tons of coal a year at its peak in 1996. On Tuesday, the last coal ship of its kind arrived at the site to supply its two remaining generators, reports Bloomberg. A new wood-fired boiler will be added to the existing biofuel and trash burning units when the coal supply runs out in 2020. \u2013 When the last coal ship rolled into Russia's largest coal-fired power plant this week, it marked the end of an era\u2014one that saw the plant burn as much as 650,000 tons of coal at a time from the 1960s on. But the plant's two remaining fossil-fuel generators will have enough fuel to last until 2020, and that's when a new wood-fired boiler will be added to supplement the facility's existing biofuel and trash burning units, the Wall Street Journal reports. Malarenergi has a number of deals with cities to receive trash, and even imports waste from Britain to fuel its main boiler. The facility, which supplies power to about 150,000 households, burned up to 200,000 tons ofcoal at its peak in 1996. The coal was burned to create electricity, but the power plant also produces electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar power.

In September 2008, he was promoted to head the agency\u2019s detention and removal operations, managing a staff of 8,500 and a budget of about $2.5 billion, according to the lawsuit. \n \n But Mr. Hayes contends that he was soon supplanted in meetings by Dora B.

There was no word Monday from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who had... (Associated Press) \n \n Valery Heletey's statement, posted on the Defense Ministry website, comes amid growing confidence among government forces after they drove the insurgent militia from their stronghold of Slovyansk. \n \n Last week, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko promised cease-fire talks no later than that Saturday, but a series of military successes by the Ukrainian army may have changed minds in Kiev. Instead, on Saturday, Ukrainian troops routed the rebels in Slovyansk, forcing hundreds of militants to regroup in the regional capital, Donetsk \u2014 a rare and significant victory for Ukraine, which has often appeared helpless in the face of the spreading insurgency. \n \n On Tuesday, the mayor of Donetsk issued a statement after a meeting with Poroshenko, saying the president suggested talks could take place in Svyatogorsk, a town in the north of the region. \n \n The insurgents would be unlikely to agree to Svyatogorsk, which is controlled by Kiev. \"I don't think we will go there. It's not safe,\" rebel leader Alexander Borodai told Interfax news agency. He said locations acceptable to the rebels include Donetsk, Russia or Belarus. \n \n A 10-day cease-fire that ended in late June was punctuated by frequent clashes and provided no progress in reaching a negotiated settlement. More than 400 people have died and thousands have fled their homes after a nearly three-month-long standoff between the rebels and the new authorities in Kiev, who came to power after the ex-president's ouster in February. \n \n Rebels in Ukraine and nationalists in Russia have called for the Kremlin to protect the insurgents, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far made no comment on the rebels' defeat in Slovyansk, while state media and other officials have downplayed the loss. Putin may be wary of more sanctions being imposed by the West, which slapped visa bans and financial sanctions on Russia's top officials for their role in annexing the Black Sea region of Crimea in March. ||||| As Ukraine laid plans for a siege of pro-Russia separatists' remaining bastions Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin faced a critical decision on whether to answer rebel pleas for military help\u2014a move that could determine what he gains or loses following a monthslong conflict that has roiled global powers. \n \n Russia has encouraged and supported the separatists during their insurgency, but has been unusually quiet since the Ukrainian... ||||| It has been raining for two days in the black earth region of eastern Ukraine, and the soldiers perching on the motley collection of vehicles clogging the southbound lane of the highway into Slavyansk huddle under their ponchos like drowned rats. \n \n But they still manage to flash victory signs at their comrades manning roadside checkpoints. For this is an army on the advance, and the city they are entering was until 48 hours ago their enemies\u2019 most important redoubt. \n \n Ukrainian forces established a ring of checkpoints around Slavyansk in early May, effectively laying siege to the city in an attempt to contain the rebel expansion. \n \n But the blockade was fractured and the isolated checkpoints vulnerable to attacks by rebel forces based in the city. \n \n A little over a week earlier, rebels used tanks to surprise and destroy a checkpoint to the north of the city, in a demoralising blow to government forces. \n \n It was one strike in a scrappy war of raid and counter-raid at which the highly motivated pro-Russian fighters excelled \u2013 and which appeared to be locked in a bloody stalemate. \n \n Ukrainian soldiers look at wrecked tanks and armored personnel carriers left by pro-Russian insurgents in Slavyansk, Ukraine (Getty) \n \n That resistance crumbled suddenly and in the early hours of Saturday morning, following several days of artillery bombardment to which the rebels had no answer. \n \n Gathering their remaining tanks and fighting vehicles, Igor Strelkov, the rebel commander, and his men made a desperate dash for Donetsk, the regional capital 60 miles to the south where the self-declared People\u2019s Republic had established its government. \n \n Most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the fighters appear to have got through. With the rebel army regrouping, fears are growing of a similar, and perhaps even bloodier, siege in Donetsk, which, with a population of one million, is 10 times the size of Slavyansk. \n \n Two days after the break-out, Slavyansk \u2013 scarred by battle, but far from destroyed \u2013 is still a long way from a return to pre-war normality. Ukrainian troops are building their own pillboxes to reinforce checkpoints and sandbag bunkers once manned by pro-Russian militiamen. \n \n There is still no running water or electricity. Gas has cut out more than once and few, if any, businesses are open. The streets remain largely deserted, much of the civilian population having fled or remaining indoors. \n \n On Lenin Square, a small crowd of mostly elderly civilians waited for distribution of the \u201chumanitarian\u201d supplies \u2013 mostly food, water and medicines \u2013 promised by Kiev.

In a strange twist, they now serve alongside men of the Berkut, the elite riot police with whom they fought running battles in Kiev this winter.

But the superior numbers and resources of the Ukrainians are beginning to tell. \n \n Out-gunned, outnumbered, and with the Kremlin refusing to respond to their pleas for military intervention, the fighters of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic appear to be facing certain defeat. \n \n Yet this war is still far from over. \n \n The rebel militia may have suffered a major setback, but their dogged defence of Slavyansk and the breakout itself shows a fighting ability and level of motivation that will make any battle for Donetsk a bloody affair. \n \n On Monday, Ukraine\u2019s richest man, Rinat Ahmetov, pleaded with the government not to bomb his home city. Pro-Russian rebels put up new barricades and residents said they feared the potential battle to come.

But Vladimir Putin has been suspiciously silent, ignoring the separatists' increasingly urgent pleas for help, and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses, having already taken the real prize of Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports. Observers believe Moscow has ruled out any military intervention, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference, saying, \"A quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest.\" But one US official cautioned against declaring victory. \"There is only one person who knows what Putin is planning,\" he said, \"and that is Putin.\"",

Valery Heletey's statement, posted on the Defense Ministry website, comes amid growing confidence among government forces after they drove the insurgent militia from their stronghold of Slovyansk, the AP reports. Last week, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko promised ceasefire talks no later than that Saturday, but a series of military successes by the Ukrainian army may have changed minds in Kiev. Instead, on Saturday, Ukrainian troops routed the rebels, forcing hundreds of militants to regroup in the regional capital, Donetsk\u2014a rare and significant victory for Ukraine, which has often appeared helpless in the face of the spreading insurgency. On today, the mayor of Donetsk issued a statement after a meeting with Poroshenko, saying the president suggested talks could take place in Svyatogorsk, a town in the north of the region. \"I don't think we will go there. It's not safe,\" rebel leader Alexander Borodai told Interfax news agency. He said locations acceptable to the rebels include Donetsk, Russia, or Belarus. A 10-day ceasefire that ended in late June was punctuated by frequent clashes and \u2013 Ukraine has made good on its threat to go after the last of the pro-Russia rebels in the country's east, driving them out of the key city of Slovyansk with the help of helicopter gunships and artillery, reports the New York Times. \"The city is in the hands of the armed forces of Ukraine and we are ready to fight for it,\" said Oleksandr Turchynov, Ukraine's new prime minister, in a televised address to the nation. \"We will not allow the terrorists to leave the city. They will be destroyed,\" he said, according to the Wall Street Journal. More than 400 people have now died in the conflict, the Times notes. In other developments: Pro-Russia fighters have surrendered in the city of Slaviansk after more than a week of fighting, the BBC reports. Ukrainian forces have also taken control of the town of Horlivka, which the rebels had threatened to destroy if they didn't get their way in the east. The Ukrainian military says it will use armored vehicles, artillery, and drones to try to retake the towns in the coming days, the AP reports.

(Associated Press) \n \n \"This day will always be hard, but this place will always be strong,\" former Mayor Thomas Menino told an invitation-only audience of about 2,500 people gathered at the Hynes Convention Center, not far from the marathon finish line where three people died and more than 260 others were injured a year ago. \n \n In Washington, President Barack Obama planned to observe the anniversary with a private moment of silence at the White House. \n \n \"Today, we recognize the incredible courage and leadership of so many Bostonians in the wake of unspeakable tragedy,\" Obama said in a statement. \"And we offer our deepest gratitude to the courageous firefighters, police officers, medical professionals, runners and spectators who, in an instant, displayed the spirit Boston was built on \u2014 perseverance, freedom and love.\" \n \n Obama said this year's race, scheduled for Monday, will \"show the world the meaning of Boston Strong as a city chooses to run again.\" \n \n Vice President Joe Biden was in Boston for the ceremony, and he said the courage shown by survivors and those who lost loved ones is an inspiration for other Americans dealing with loss and tragedy. He praised four survivors who spoke before he did and said that though he's not a Boston sports fan, Boston is an incredible city. \n \n \"We are Boston. We are America. We respond. We endure. We overcome. And we own the finish line,\" he concluded, to loud applause. \n \n Earlier in the day, a wreath-laying ceremony drew the families of the three people killed \u2014 Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell and Lu Lingzi \u2014 as well as relatives of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier, who was killed in the aftermath of the blasts. \n \n Gov. Deval Patrick, Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley were among those who attended the morning ceremony held in a light rain as bagpipes played. O'Malley offered a prayer. \n \n They were also honored at the Hynes center, where the survivors who spoke included newlywed Patrick Downes and dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis, both of whom lost their lower left legs in the bombings. \n \n \"We should have never met this way, but we are so grateful for each other,\" Downes said, describing the sense of community that has developed among the survivors. \n \n Carlos Arredondo, the cowboy hat-wearing spectator who was hailed as a hero for helping the wounded after the bombings, said he came to the tribute ceremony to support survivors and their families.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died following a shootout with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and is awaiting trial. He faces the possibility of the death penalty. \n \n The Tsarnaevs, ethnic Chechens who lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the Dagestan region of Russia, settled in Cambridge, outside Boston, more than a decade ago after moving to the U.S. as children with their family. \n \n Prosecutors have said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left a hand-scrawled confession condemning U.S. actions in Muslim countries on the inside wall of a boat he was found hiding in following the police shootout. ||||| (CNN) -- A moment of silence at the finish line, the tolling of church bells and a solemn flag-raising ceremony capped the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing on Tuesday. \n \n Under a steady rain on Boylston Street, where two homemade bombs last April 15 marked the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, scores gathered in the personification of a slogan that captured the country: \"Boston Strong.\" \n \n After a stirring rendition of \"God Bless America,\" ordinary people, bombing survivors, first responders and dignitaries -- including Vice President Joe Biden -- bowed their heads in a moment of silence, saw the American flag raised, and sang the national anthem shortly before 3 p.m. on the spot where explosions, carnage, screams and smoke interrupted one of the city's most joyous and popular events one year ago. \n \n Earlier, thousands gathered to mark the anniversary of a horror that shook the nation. \n \n \"We would never wish the devastation and pain we have experienced on any of you,\" said Patrick Downes, who was among the many injured in the twin bombings at last year's Boston Marathon. \"However, we do wish that all of you, at some point in your lives, feel as loved as we have felt this last year. It has been the most humbling experience of our lives. We hope you feel all the emotion we feel when we say 'thank you.'\" \n \n Downes was a newlywed at the time of the attack. He and his wife, Jessica Kensky, each lost a leg. \n \n Before the crowd gathered Tuesday at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center, he spoke of the three people killed in the blasts and a university police officer killed days later amid efforts to catch the suspects. He called them \"guardian angels.\" \n \n \"Let's show them they live on in our bonds of family, friendship and community and in the infectious spirit we will feel on the third Monday in April for years to come.\" That's the date of the marathon. \n \n After a string of speakers, Biden began his remarks by saying, \"I've never witnessed a tribute like I heard today.\" To the survivors, he said, \"My God, you have survived and you have soared. You are truly inspiring. I've never heard anything so beautiful as what all of you just said.\" \n \n \"So much has been taken from you, but you never, never have given up,\" he said. \n \n \"You have become the face of America's resolve for the whole world to see,\" Biden said, adding that people all around the world know the pride, courage, and resolve of Bostonians. \"That's why the twisted, cowardly terrorists who acted here and in other places do what they do. They try to instill fear so that we will jettison what we value the most and what the world most values about us: an open society, our system of justice, our freedom of religion; our access to opportunity, the free flow of information and ideas.\" \n \n The terrorists, Biden said, \"wanted to make America afraid so that maybe, maybe, we'd begin to change our ways. That's the objective -- the very soul of who we are. They figured if they instill enough fear, we will change. And it infuriates them that we refuse to bend, refuse to change, refuse to yield to fear. \n \n \"You are Boston strong. But America is strong. ... That's what makes us so proud of this city and this state. What makes me so proud to be an American is that we have never, ever yielded to fear. Never.\" \n \n At the marathon, \"the whole world witnessed ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things\" to help each other, the vice president said. \n \n \"America will never, ever, ever stand down,\" he said. \"We are Boston. We are America. We respond, we endure, we overcome and we own the finish line.\" \n \n 'Boston strong' \n \n \"Next week, we will run again,\" said Tom Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association. \"But on this day, in this place, in remembrance and resolve, we gather as citizens of Boston, Boston strong.\" \n \n One year ago, \"the very fabric of this community was tested to its core,\" he said, but the city \"inspired.\" \n \n \"You are strong at this broken place,\" former Mayor Tom Menino told the crowd, adding, \"the heartbeat of Boston is a mighty force.\" \n \n To those who lost loved ones and to the many who were wounded, Menino said, \"whatever you have to do to recover and carry on, know that the people of Boston and I will be right there by your side.\" Menino was mayor at the time of the attack. \n \n On April 15, 2013, the Patriots' Day bombings killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and wounded at least 264 others. The city then underwent days of fear as the two identified suspects, the Tsarnaev brothers, were on the run. Police say they killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in the process, and then Tamerlan Tsarnaev was run over by his younger brother, Dzhokhar, as they battled police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts and is scheduled to go on trial in November. \n \n Obama: Boston will show it 'chooses to run again' \n \n \"A year ago, tragedy struck at the 117th Boston Marathon,\" President Obama said in a written statement Tuesday. \"Four innocent people were killed that week, and hundreds more were wounded. Today, we remember Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier. And we send our thoughts and prayers to those still struggling to recover... \n \n \"One year later, we also stand in awe of the men and women who continue to inspire us -- learning to stand, walk, dance and run again. With each new step our country is moved by the resilience of a community and a city. And when the sun rises over Boylston Street next Monday -- Patriot's Day -- hundreds of thousands will come together to show the world the meaning of Boston Strong as a city chooses to run again.\" \n \n David Yepez, a teen who was wounded in the attack, followed Downes at Tuesday's ceremony. He hailed the first responders, doctors and others who helped in the wake of the bombings. \"Thank you for your love, compassion and generosity,\" Yepez said. \"You have touched our hearts in a way that, many times, our gratitude could only be expressed through our tears of joy.\" \n \n Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who lost her left foot in the attack, told the crowd, \"If anyone is wondering what they can do, what you can do, I would answer: Look around. People in your community need your support. They need your patience and they need your time. ... Let April 15 be a day when we all work together to make this world a better place.\" \n \n Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said, \"We share the same fears, the same hopes, the same community,\" he said. \"We are, in the end, one community.\" \n \n He added that he hopes \"as we remember the dead and encourage the injured, that we remember community. ... The power of love itself -- that's what community is.\" \n \n A series of musical performances helped set a solemn but hopeful tone for the ceremony. The world-renowned Boston Pops orchestra performed, with singer Renese King singing both \"America the Beautiful\" and \"For Good,\" a song from the musical \"Wicked.\" The Boston Children's Chorus performed \"Up to the Mountain.\" \n \n A year after the bombings, families of the victims are struggling to come to terms with the loss. \n \n \"She had that special, I don't know what it is, that special thing about her,\" said Lillian Campbell, grandmother of bombing victim Krystle Campbell, 29. \"And you felt happy around her because she was always laughing and bubbly. I loved her.\" \n \n Some victims injured in the attack are showing their perseverance by planning to take part in this year's marathon, scheduled for Monday -- even victims who suffered severe injuries. \n \n \"Last year, I was on the ground at the finish line. This year, I'll be running across it,\" said Kevin White. \"It kind of proves to people that evil isn't going to win.\" White, then 34, had shrapnel through his legs a year ago. His 71-year-old father, Bill, lost a leg. \n \n Authorities have announced extensive security plans for this year's marathon, which is expected to bring in $176 million for the Boston area's economy. \n \n Brothers Paul and J.P. Norden each lost a leg in the attack last year. On Tuesday, they began a trek: walking the entire 26.2-mile marathon route, along with family and good friends. \"I feel so blessed,\" their mother, Liz, said in a Facebook post, adding that she couldn't be prouder. \n \n Police investigate bags near finish line \n \n Hours after Tuesday's anniversary event, a police bomb squad investigated two backpacks near the marathon finish line, cordoning off the area. They \"disrupted and rendered safe\" both bags, police spokesman David Estrada said. In a Twitter post, police said the detonations were \"precautionary measures.\" \n \n The bags were found around 6:50 p.m., police said. One bag was unattended, while the other one was worn by an individual. \n \n A Boston police officer noticed a man walking down Boylston Street barefoot in the rain and wearing a backpack, \n \n The officer asked him what was in the backpack. The man said there was a rice cooker in the backpack, Boston Police Superintendent Randy Halstead said. \n \n \"Training kicked in. We looked into the backpack, saw that it was what appeared to be a rice cooker, had the individual take the knapsack off, drop it on the street, and he was taken into custody,\" Halstead said. \n \n Police spokesman Mike McCarthy said the man \"got very vocal. He was yelling something.\" \n \n The man, in his early 20s, has not been publicly identified. \n \n He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device, Halstead said. The bag was inspected and deemed safe. \n \n The second bag, which was abandoned, belonged to a media outlet, a law enforcement source said. \n \n An FBI spokeswoman said the agency was assisting police. \n \n Earlier Tuesday, police responded to a report of a possible pipe bomb near Boston's South Station. Investigators determined it wasn't an explosive, but rather a high-voltage fuse that didn't pose a threat, state officials said. \n \n Authorities seemed to be bracing for the possibility of more bomb scares. \n \n \"To ease fears & concerns relating to backpacks,\" Boston Police said in a Twitter post Tuesday night that they were \"discouraging their use\" at this year's marathon. \n \n CNN's Susan Candiotti, Haimy Assefa and Holly Yan contributed to this report.",

He concluded, to loud applause, \"We are Boston. We are America. We respond. We overcome. And we own the finish line.\" Vice President Joe Biden was in Boston for the ceremony, and he said the courage shown by survivors and those who lost loved ones is an inspiration for other Americans dealing with loss and tragedy. \"Today, we recognize the incredible courage and leadership of so many Bostonians in the wake of unspeakable tragedy,\" said President Obama in a statement. \"And we offer our deepest gratitude to the courageous firefighters, police officers, medical professionals, runners, and spectators who, in an instant, displayed the spirit Boston was built on\u2014 perseverance, freedom, and love.\" This year's race, scheduled for Monday, will \" \u2013 Survivors, first responders, and relatives of those killed or injured in the Boston Marathon bombing gathered today at the site of the attack to mark the one-year anniversary.

The two explosions at the marathon finish line last year killed three people and injured more than 260. (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is facing the death penalty.) \"We should have never met this way, but we are so grateful for each other,\" said a survivor who lost both legs. \"You can see how the whole community gathered together to support them and remember,\" said Carlos Arredondo, the man who was hailed as a hero for helping the wounded. \u2013 Boston marked the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing with a ceremony that included a moment of silence, the raising of the American flag on Boylston Street, and the singing of the national anthem, CNN reports. \"We would never wish the devastation and pain we have experienced on any of you,\" said a survivor. \"However, we do wish that all of you, at some point in your lives, feel as loved as we have felt this last year. It has been the most humbling experience of our lives. We hope you feel all the emotion we feel when we say 'thank you.'\" Vice President Joe Biden paid tribute to the three people killed and the more than 260 injured, calling them \"guardian angels.\" \"You have become the face of America's resolve for the whole world to see,\" he said. \"That's why the twisted, cowardly terrorists who acted here and in other places do what they do. They try to instill fear so that we will jettison what we value the most and what the world most values about us: an open society, our system of justice, our freedom of religion; our access to opportunity, the free flow of information and ideas.\" \u2013 Vice President Joe Biden joined survivors, victims' families, and officials from the city and state to honor the three people killed and 264 injured in the Boston Marathon bombing a year ago today. \"You are Boston strong,\" Biden told the crowd. \"But America is strong. ... That's what makes us so proud of this city and this state. What makes me so proud to be an American is that we have never, ever yielded to fear. Never.\" At the marathon, \"the whole world witnessed ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things\" to help each other, he said. \"We are Boston. We are America. We respond, we endure, we overcome, and we own the finish line.\" Former Mayor Tom Menino also praised the city's resilience. \"The heartbeat of Boston is a mighty force,\" he said, according to the Boston Globe. \"Whatever you have to do to recover and carry on, know that the people of Boston and I will be right there by your side.\" Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who lost her left foot in the attack, said, \"If anyone is wondering what they can do, what you can do ...

They need your \u2013 Today is the one-year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing, and the city is honoring the three people who died and more than 260 who were injured with a solemn ceremony at the site of the attack.

Deval Patrick. A haunting rendition of \"America the Beautiful\" by Renese King was performed by the Boston Pops, while the children's chorus sang \"Up to the Mountain.\" \"As we remember the dead and encourage the injured, that we remember community,\" said Patrick. \"The power of love itself\u2014that's what community is.\" A second ceremony will be held today at 2:50pm, the time the bombs went off a year ago today, the AP reports.

They let me touch Poppie. I kissed her on the head. \n \n \"But it was so frantic. I heard another cry, that was number two, Mollie. It was very emotional, the reality sunk in as they were rushed to the special baby unit.\u201d \n \n Poppie, Hollie and Evelyn weighed 1lb 9oz, 1lb 7oz and 1lb 6oz respectively and were put in incubators and on ventilators as their lungs were so tiny. \n \n Speaking before Christmas, Rachel recalled her first sight of them. \n \n \u201cThey wheeled me down.
