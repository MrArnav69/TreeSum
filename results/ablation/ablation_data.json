You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ||||| One tweet too many \n \n X marks the spot where Denis Finley, editor of the paper in Bernie Sanders' hometown, screwed up. If Oprah Winfrey was the media's Big Winner for her Golden Globes peroration on sexual harassment, Finley was a (fortunately less-publicized) Big Loser due to ham-handed tweets. \n \n Even the most sober of mainstream media get bollixed up over page views and reader engagement as they seek to be more refined P.T. Barnums of a digital age. Being provocative for provocation's sake is increasingly rationalized as a way to promote your handiwork, no matter how tenuous and fleeting the actual loyalty manifested (perhaps with help from a Drudge Report link) might be. \n \n But, as Finley, executive editor of the Gannett-owned Burlington Free Press, unwittingly reminds us, there's a difference between being responsibly provocative and perhaps tone deaf to your audience \u2014 especially in the digital age. \n \n Vermont plans to join Oregon and Washington, D.C., in offering drivers a third option in listing gender on licenses. So M, F or X. In liberal Burlington, where Sanders was mayor, it's not unpopular. And it just prompted one citizen's tweet, \"This is awesome! // #VT Is One Step Closer To Offering A Third Gender On Driver's Licenses.\" But Finley, who came to the Free Press from Virginia in 2016 after a long stint as Norfolk Virginian-Pilot editor (and, briefly, as publicist for a Norfolk museum), felt compelled to respond: \"Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse.\" \n \n If Winfrey played brilliantly to her audience, Finley fumbled in recognizing his. The Vermont online universe is now filled with mostly outrage, and claims of canceling subscriptions. In fact, it was only the third in a succession of curious tweets by Finley. They underscored the tempting perils of journalists, even newsroom bosses, who feel compelled to opine on, well, just about anything.Thus, Finley saw an Associated Press tweet on how fans of Frank Lloyd Wright are seeking to prevent the demolition of a Montana office building designed in 1958. This inspired a response: \"I don't care who designed them, destroy all office buildings.\" \n \n Fine. Chalk that up to lame humor. Then, after word from none other than The New York Times that \"Former President Barack Obama is to be the first guest on David Letterman's new monthly Netflix talk show,\" he sought to exhibit his inner Jimmy Kimmel with this: \"Another reason not to subscribe to Netflix.\" That was lame, with a smidgen of the obtuse. \n \n As outrage quickly manifested itself over the gender matter, Finley seemed to dig a deeper hole. A Tim Sinnott tweeted that the state policy was awesome \"because recognition is awesome\" and Finley responded, \"All recognition? Any recognition, Tim? What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking. Not all recognition is awesome.\" \n \n Finley was either high-mindedly engaged in a Socratic inquiry, as if teaching a constitutional law seminar, or manifesting Jonesean (as in Alex Jones, of InfoWars) subtlety cum derision. If I'm a top Gannett official, I might now be wondering if a second bomb cyclone affecting New England is actually on my payroll. \n \n \"So you think trans people are the equivalent of pedophiles?\" Anderson asked. \n \n When tracked down by Vermont's Seven Days about the flap (He declined comment when I contacted him, saying, \"Maybe in a few days\"), Finley said, \"I really just wanted to ask the question: 'Why is that awesome? And why is that necessary?' That\u2019s all, and I think any journalist would ask that question.\" He said use of the word apocalypse was inspired by a Sports Illustrated feature, \"Signs of the Apocalypse.\" \n \n When I passed through Burlington last summer, there were still Sanders T-shirts in store windows. How long before some retail outlets offer a tie-dyed image of Finley with a big, fat \"X\"? \n \n \"Denis Finley doesn't seem to care that, when he enters the arena as executive editor, he carries the reputation of his news organization with him. 'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,\" says Tom Kearney, deputy managing editor of the Stowe Reporter, Waterbury Record and News & Citizen of Morrisville, and executive editor of the Shelburne News and The Citizen, which serves Charlotte and Hinesburg. \n \n Then there's Jon Margolis, who was an A-list national political writer during his heyday with The Chicago Tribune. That was a pre-internet world where reporters and editors weren't tweeting their views on everything from whom they'd seen at lunch, a referee's call in the NFL game they were watching or, of course, every breathing moment of Donald Trump. \n \n \"Why this urge to tweet so often?\" asks Margolis, who is retired in South Burlington, a few blocks from the Burlington city line. \"I do not think the world breathlessly awaits my latest witty aphorism or my personal take on what happened today. If I have something to offer that\u2019s worthwhile, I\u2019ll write a piece about it. That means reporting \u2014 online, on the phone, at somebody\u2019s office. And then writing, as well as possible, which means as succinctly as possible but always more than 280 clicks of the keyboard.\" \n \n \n \n \"Tweeting is like artificial turf. The technology makes it possible, not advisable. That would apply even where the tweet is not as aggressively ignorant as Finley\u2019s. But just think: Were he writing an article instead of a blurt (essentially what a tweet is) he might have read it over and then altered (or deep-sixed) it. Or had somebody else edit it, which even the boss should always do. Amazing how the conventional processes of newspapers can save us from ourselves.\" \n \n Jake Tapper vs. Stephen Miller \n \n Jousting between cable TV hosts and guests is now a performance fixture. Bill O'Reilly rode it to riches before his sexual harassment self-immolation. In its most pedestrian post-O'Reilly form, it brings some well intentioned but weak liberal saps served up as red meat for Fox's Tucker Carlson. \n \n In a fairer tussle, it brought us CNN's Jake Tapper and White House aide Stephen Miller. And Tapper giving him the boot. \n \n Tapper is evolving into his network's prime skeptic of all things Trump and, unlike Carlson, not reflexively given to pillorying lightweight guests. And Miller is the unbridled partisan who has reveled in public combat ever since his high school days at a largely liberal Los Angeles high school \n \n As The New York Times' Matt Flegenheimer has put it in a profile of Miller, his life \"is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.\" \n \n \"These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House \u2014 and many former peers fear.\" \n \n This all began with the equally pro forma, and dungeon's host salutation, \"Stephen, thanks so much for joining us and happy new year, good to see you.\" \n \n On Sunday, Miller called Michael Wolff the \"garbage author of a garbage book,\" a rather mediocre pre-meditated line for someone of his acerbic and calculating essence. He called Trump a \"political genius.\" He called it a \"work of pure fiction.\" And \"a pile of trash.\" \n \n It was mostly solid, fair-minded inquisition by Tapper for about six minutes, until it first got a tad personal and each started cutting off the other. Miller referred to CNN's Trump coverage as hysterical, and Tapper suggested it was Miller who was being hysterical. As if Miler were a child, Tapper asked him to \"settle down, settle down.\" \n \n At the nine-minute mark, what had seemed a small lull turned sour as Tapper brought up a letter that Miller wrote on the subject of firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Miller stumbled a tad before Tapper broached the president's bizarre Saturday tweet on his own purported genius. \n \n Tapper correctly persisted in broaching the public discourse on Trump's rationality, as Miller sought to divert the topic to his theme of CNN being out of touch with a working America that his boss understands and CNN doesn't. \n \n Then, Tapper had enough. He said that Miller was being \"obsequious,\" playing to an audience of one (Trump) and not answering his question. He simply cut him off. It was rather abrupt and could have been executed in a less peremptory manner. It came off as a host losing control, as much as Trump critics loved the scene and think Miller deserved it. But if you don't want to fight the lions, stay away from their pen. \n \n Regardless, both Miller and Tapper surely came away thinking they'd won (maybe all the more so as Miller was escorted out by security). Predictably, Trump soon tweeted some venom Tapper's way: \"Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!\" \n \n New York Times unveils ad on Golden Globes \n \n Truly salute The New York Times for actually trying to market excellence in a way that's about 20 years late for most of the newspaper industry. It unveiled the next part of its \"The Truth is Hard\" brand campaign during NBC's Golden Globes broadcast. \n \n Similar to its first ad on last year's Oscars, the ad features black type against a white background. \"He said, she said\" are the first words you see. Then they are repeated multiple times until it's just, \"She said, she said, she said, she said,\" with the ad ending \"The truth has power. The truth will not be threatened. The truth has a voice.\" \n \n The \"truth has a voice\" is a simple and potent notion. But, as a TV spot, it falls a bit flat. As one top advertising executive told me, it's unlikely that most viewers connected the paper's incredible sex harassment reporting, including on Harvey Weinstein, and the ad. For those who who did \u2014 the event was filled with unavoidable talk of sex harassment in Hollywood, including Seth Meyers' opening monologue \u2014 the ad was preaching to the choir. \n \n Potency of advertising involves melding the right media and the right audience. In a narrow sense, the Golden Globes might seem a good target \u2014 but only in a narrow sense. The Times has a great narrative to spin as to why it should be trusted, including its admirable attention to fact-checking and precision (even with some hotly disputed cuts in the copy editing force). Perhaps a larger campaign can include such factors. \n \n It's because the challenge for quality media involves more than the mere declaration of virtue. As with changing the attitudes of Americans toward sex harassment, changing attitudes toward even the best of media \u2014 especially when it comes to people paying for content \u2014 will involve a military-like campaign, with no one-size-fits-all-messages and the unavoidable (and very expensive) need to make the case with unprecedented regularity and persistence. \n \n TV news viewing continues to head south, Trump aside \n \n As Poynter reports, \"Until now, local TV news viewership has been declining slowly. But a new Pew research study shows that from 2016 to 2017, the decline picked up speed.\" \n \n Younger Americans' turn from TV news is important. But, somewhere in the mix, is surely ideology, though the study does not point explicitly to what's been previously shown to be the sharp decline in Republicans' confidence in \"mass media.\" \n \n A revealing photo history \n \n The Associated Press put together a gallery of photos of what actresses have tended to wear at the Golden Globe Awards over the years, as opposed to the black dresses they pointedly wore last night. \n \n The morning Babel \n \n CNN opened with Trump defending his mental fitness and, no surprise, a very brief take at colleague Tapper's spat with Miller. It gave rather more time to social media hurrahs about Winfrey's Golden Globes speech and the notion of her running for president. \n \n \"When you think of the Democratic lineup for 2020 ... you pretty quickly run out of star power,\" said Brian Stelter, media reporter cum political analyst. \"If you want to fight fire with fire, Trump is a reality TV star and Oprah Winfrey has been on TV in some ways longer than he has. There are a lot of reasons why this might make sense to Democratic insiders. That speech if anything, gave people more reason to dream it up.\" For sure, there was a smattering of speculation. But, one might hope, it quickly encounters recognition of what's playing out before us: the obvious limits of electing somebody with no experience in the arena. \n \n MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" backed Tapper's performance (\"I would have cut it short after the second answer,\" said Mika Brzezinski) and was the latest to get time with author Michael Wolff. And, before then, there was Axios' Jonathan Swan on what appears to be Trump's shrinking work schedule and also the co-hosts' riff on Trump's insecurity. The latter included the co-hosts venturing into the topic of TV stars, no names mentioned, being self-absorbed (\"We've met a lot of people in television who are narcissistic and stupid,\" Brzezinski said). Hmmm. \n \n But it was a different tone on Trump's favorite morning show, \"Trump & Friends,\" where co-host Brian Kilmeade surfaced at Pancake Pantry in Nashville, Tenn., for breakfast and generally supportive Trump chat. Oh, he was also giving away free to diners copies of new books both by himself and co-host Ainsley Earhardt. Call it a celebration of American commerce. \n \n Sending individuals back to harm \n \n Sarah Stillman, who heads the Global Migration Project at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has been compiling a database of individuals essentially deported to harm, even death in Central America. With the help of a dozen students, and lots of activists involved in immigrant rights, humanitarian aid and other organizations, she's now uncovered patterns of awful consequences to what can at times seem almost frivolous infractions and, too, insufficient government due diligence and articulation to individuals of their rights. The melancholy bottom line is underscored in this New Yorker piece. \n \n Terrific women in a mostly male soccer universe \n \n Watching loads of English soccer over the past week, I was reminded of the terrific in-studio hosting work of Brit Rebecca Lowe for NBC's fine coverage of Premier League matches, as well as Brit Kate Abdo (who is also fluent in Spanish, German and French) for Fox Sports' solid (not quite as strong and measured as NBC's) coverage of the related FA Cup tournament. The latter is one in which the top rank teams are thrown into a mix with lower division ones in frequent David vs. Goliath contests (often at the very quaint fields of the Davids). Sunday, mighty Arsenal was such a victim. \n \n And yet, they are surrounded by a sea of men, in studio and out, with all the match announcers men and, with a single seeming exception, glimpsed in an Arsenal-Nottingham Forest match yesterday, all the refs and linesman are male (there was a female linesman). \n \n New England hoopla \n \n New England Patriots fans have reason to be suspicious of ESPN, as Boston.com columnist Chad Finn, underscores. An us-versus-the-world mindset is partly fueled by some inaccurate reporting on the Patriots by ESPN. But when it comes to its chronicle of rising tensions among the owner, coach and star quarterback, Finn defends reporter Seth Wickersham \n \n The reflexive doubts are too bad, he writes, since \"if the story is read with clear eyes and all rooting interests aside, it\u2019s far more illuminating than it is salacious.\" \n \n Are we so sure that Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction? \n \n Writing in the excellent Lawfare blog, Harvard Law's Jack Goldsmith raises the possibility that the seeming lack of recusal by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the Mueller Russia investigation might suggest that there's not the obstruction investigation that folks assume (speculation fueled further by a Michael Schmidt opus in The New York Times last week). \n \n \"One possibility is that Rosenstein has no conflict because Mueller is not actually investigating the president for obstruction. It has been widely reported for months in multiple reputable outlets that Mueller is conducting such an investigation. Schmidt\u2019s story implies that he is, and reports that Mueller has evidence in his possession that appears relevant only to an obstruction investigation.\" \n \n The reader over your shoulder \n \n There's unavoidable counsel to journalists in a blog in the Paris Review, the literary bastion founded by the late George Plimpton, as Patricia O'Conner an author and former staff writer at The New York Times Book Review, discusses a 1940s work by poet-novelist Robert Graves, \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose.\u201d \n \n The book turned on the notion that writers should imagine a bunch of readers standing over their shoulder, in the process laying out 41 core principles and, then, annealing 50 excerpts of writing from famous authors to school headmasters. Graves was pretty fearless in underscoring lack of clarity. \n \n As O'Conner puts it, \"Those forty-one principles work both ways; they make for better reading as well as better writing. They can show a reader what\u2019s wrong with something that rings false or doesn\u2019t make sense or leaves questions unanswered. In a climate where rumors, impressions, and outright lies are sometimes treated as fact, informed readers are more important than ever. No democracy can afford to be without readers who can ask the right questions, who can critically judge what they read, who can mentally peer over an author\u2019s shoulder.\" \n \n And tonight's big college football championship game \n \n It's Alabama versus Georgia and, reports The Wall Street Journal this morning, \"ESPN, armed with new data about its viewers, is more aggressively selling its female audience, starting with the College Football Playoff, which culminates in Monday\u2019s championship game. The timing couldn\u2019t be better. Advertisers are looking for new ways to reach women, and more efficiently reach broader audiences, as consumer viewing habits change.\" \n \n \"Financial services firm Northwestern Mutual is among the advertisers using college football to reach women and families. The company wasn\u2019t new to the playoff, and knew that the sporting event reached a 'healthy mix of men and women and families,' but a new pitch and compelling data from ESPN helped the company 'come up with different ad spots' targeting women and families, said Aditi Gokhale, Northwestern Mutual\u2019s chief marketing officer.\" \n \n Corrections?

    "summary": "\u2013 Denis Finley has taken to Twitter to call Politico a \"whore,\" sniff about David Letterman's upcoming Netflix show featuring Barack Obama, and call for the destruction of all office buildings, but it was his tweets about a potential change to Vermont's driver's licenses that cost him his job as editor of the Burlington Free Press. The paper reports Finley was fired by honchos at parent company Gannett on Monday evening after he was found to have repeatedly flouted its social media rules. \"We encourage our journalists to engage in a meaningful dialogue on social media, but ... the conversation [should] adhere to our overarching values of fairness, balance, and objectivity,\" says an exec from the USA Today Network, Gannett's main brand. Poynter explains Finley's demise came after he reacted to Vermont's proposal to add the gender option \"X\" to \"F\" and \"M\" on driver's licenses. The Washington Post documents the Twitter exchange between commenters who were lauding Vermont's decision and Finley. After one user noted the news was \"awesome,\" Finley replied: \"Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse.\" When someone else tweeted the recognition of different genders was awesome, Finley wrote: \"All recognition? \u2026 What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking.\" Poynter notes some readers threatened to cancel their Free Press subscriptions over the tweets. \"'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,\" an editor for a string of other local Vermont papers says. Emilie Stigliani, the Free Press' planning editor, will temporarily step in as Finley's replacement."

    "document": "CNN host Piers Morgan just called to discuss his interview last night with Alex Jones, the conservative radio host and gun advocate who went on a tirade against Morgan, gun control legislation, and a litany of government conspiracies. \n \n \"He was the best advertisement for gun control you could wish for,\" Morgan told POLITICO. \n \n (VIDEO: 6 explosive interviews) \n \n \"That kind of vitriol, hatred, and zealotry is really quite scary. I didn't feel threatened by him, but I'm concerned that someone like him has that level of influence,\" Morgan said. \"There's got to be a level of discourse that can rise above what happened last night. It was undignified, unedifying.\" \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Alex Jones, creator of 'Deport Piers Morgan' petition, blows up on CNN) \n \n In what Morgan described as a \"big, long rant,\" Jones -- the man who started the White House petition to deport Morgan -- shouted questions about gun control legislation, gave premonitions of a 1776-like rebellion, and pronounced conspiracy theories -- including his belief that 9/11 was an inside job -- while Morgan tried calmly and in vain to conduct a civil interview. \n \n \"Sometimes it's better to let somebody have the rope they need to tie themselves in knots,\" Morgan told POLITICO, noting that he had been far more vocal and more passionate in previous interviews with gun advocates. According to Morgan, Jones continued ranting straight through the commercial break that divided the two-segment interview. \n \n (PHOTOS: Celebrities call for gun control) \n \n Morgan said he anticipated such a performance: \"I knew what we were going to be getting into with him,\" he said. \"I know about his background and his reputation, so I know he's kind of shock jock.\" \n \n But Jones is also influential among conservatives, Morgan said, which is why he had him on CNN. \n \n \"He said last night that his show now airs in 140 networks, he has a huge online presence -- every day his message gets sent out to millions of Americans,\" Morgan said. \"Through vitriol and rhetoric he is able to spur heavy gun sales and ammunition sales. He works off of fear.\" \n \n Jones is the host of The Alex Jones Show, based in Austin, Texas, and the creator of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, two websites that promote a worldview the Southern Poverty Law Center described as being \"governed by logic-leaping deductions and heedless pronouncements.\" \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Alex Jones detained by TSA en route to Piers Morgan interview) \n \n But Jones has made a success of those websites, of his show, and -- most recently -- of the petition to deport Morgan, which has over 100,000 signatures. Last night, White House spokesman Jay Carney issued a response to the petition, citing \"the freedom of expression\" as \"a bedrock principle in our democracy\" \n \n \"He is clearly a smart guy under the craziness,\" Morgan said. \"Look, you could tell from the way he ranted that he's not a stupid man. But that makes him more dangerous. There will be lots of people who follow him avidly who are not so intelligent, who believe everything he says.\" \n \n Morgan added that the petition to deport him was \"not an insignificant issue.\" \n \n \"There is a pattern of British people who espouse peace or want more peace being gagged in this country,\" he said, citing John Lennon and Charlie Chaplin. But Morgan said that Carney's nod to the First Amendment was promising. \n \n \"They were making the point I've been making: You can hardly accuse me of attacking the Second Amendment by attacking the First Amendment,\" he said. \"I am merely representing my opinion, and that is protected.\" \n \n (PHOTOS: Pols speak out on gun control) \n \n Though the media seems to have all but forgotten the gun control debate, and though chances for gun control legislation are starting to look dim, Morgan vowed to continue addressing the issue until government takes action. \n \n \"After every shooting, America goes back to normal. The media come off the story, nothing gets done, the pressure on politicians dissipates,\" he said. \"But you and I both know there's going to be another shooting in months, or even weeks. My intent is simply to keep this issue boiling along until the politicians act on it.\" \n \n \"I think America is getting diluted to the horror of these things: it's become too casual, too widespread, too indiscriminate, and incredibly dangerous,\" he said. \"Something has to be done.\" \n \n Read more about: Piers Morgan, Alex Jones ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was: \n \n - Slash pages from every domain on the web: \n \n \n \n \n \n -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links) \n \n \n \n -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain \n \n - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph ||||| Moments after radio host Alex Jones taped an explosive interview with CNN host Piers Morgan, Jones took to YouTube where he expressed his fear that he would be harmed by the New York Police Department or members of the mafia hired by NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg. \n \n \n \n RELATED: \u2018Deport Piers Morgan\u2019 Creator Flips Out On Morgan\u2019s Show: 1776 Will Commence Again If Guns Taken Away \n \n Jones said that he was accosted by a member of the NYPD moments before he entered CNN headquarters in New York City.

    "document": "White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci took a page out of President Trump\u2019s playbook Wednesday night with a tweet threatening to sic the FBI on a supposed information leaker. \u201cIn light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting the FBI and the Justice Department,\u201d Scaramucci wrote, inexplicably tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci did not specify what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director\u2019s required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge. Scaramucci appeared to delete the tweet, but in a subsequent post said Priebus was among the senior White House officials helping to crack down on leaks. ||||| The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Scaramucci still stands to profit from SkyBridge from the White House The newly named White House communications director has earned millions from ownership stake since last year, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n Anthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital. \n \n The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn\u2019t been previously reported. \n \n The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career \u2014 much like many of Trump\u2019s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries \u2014 and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose. \n \n Scaramucci\u2019s financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \u201cthe agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\u201d according to the filing. \n \n Bloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s black and white that he\u2019s going to get money,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. \n \n The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company\u2019s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. \n \n The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group.

(Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) Story Highlights During the 'starving time,' only 60 of 300 colonists survived \n \n Researchers: Skull shows signs of cannibalization \n \n Final blow split the cranium open \n \n WASHINGTON -- Jamestown's colonists resorted to cannibalism during the \"starving time\" winter of 1609-10, archaeologists confirmed Wednesday. \n \n In a briefing at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, archaeologist Doug Owsley presented the reconstructed skull of a 14-year-old English girl, named \"Jane\" by the researchers, discovered at the site of the fort and bearing the marks of butchery. \n \n \"The skull was split in half, most likely with a lightweight ax or quite possibly, a cleaver,\" Owsley said at the briefing. Cut marks crisscrossing the skull and jaw of the girl indicate her flesh, tongue and brains were removed from the skull, Owsley said. Those were traditional cuts for animal butchery of the time, \"all parts of the cuisine of the 17th century,\" he said. \n \n Jamestown was founded in 1607 by English colonists. The starving time was a period two years later in which 80% of the colonists died. Besieged by Powhatan Indians in their wooden fort, the settlers had been joined by new colonists late that summer, among them women and children, whose main supply ship had disappeared in a storm, leaving them without food. Only 60 of 300 people survived the winter. \n \n \"They were so emaciated when they were rescued that they were described as resembling skeletons,\" says historian James Horn of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, who spoke at the briefing. Records kept by the colony's governor, George Percy, make clear references to cannibalism during the winter, Horn says. \"The English would have only resorted to cannibalism under the most severe circumstances,\" he added. \n \n VIDEO: Cannibalism at Jamestown confirmed \n \n Owsley reported on the forensic analysis of 17th century human remains and a reconstruction of her appearance made by forensic scientists. The remains had been excavated by Jamestown archaeologists led by William Kelso of the Jamestown Recovery Project in 2012 as part of a 20-year excavation of the James Fort site. \"We don't believe Jane was a lone case,\" Kelso said. \n \n This April 2013 photo shows a forensic facial reconstruction produced by StudioEIS of Brooklyn, N.Y., in consultation with William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) \n \n \"This is amazingly interesting, but it also confirms stories of cannibalism from the settlers themselves,\" says Charles Mann, author of 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. \"Things were indeed terrible during those early years,\" Mann says, by email. \n \n While not all colonial-era historians agreed that cannibalism took place at Jamestown, most modern ones generally credited the accounts (one man was executed for eating his wife) as reliable. Horn and Owsley argued the butchery marks on Jane provide stronger evidence for the practice. \"No one can say with authoritative certainty exactly why this young lady was cut up, but given the context, it looks like butcher's marks,\" Owsley said. \n \n In the briefing, he identified a number of features on the skull and a shin bone that indicated that Jane was cannibalized. Four shallow chops to the forehead were attempted in a first, failed attempt to open the skull. The back of the head was then split open. The final blow split the cranium open. \n \n \"The person doing this was not a very good, or experienced butcher,\" Owsley said. Chop marks on the shin bone resemble more conventional butchers' marks seen on animal bones from the time, indicating that more than one person may have been involved in cannibalizing the girl. She was doubtless one of the newly arrived settlers, though still not definitively identified. An exhibition devoted to the discovery will open this Friday at the Historic Jamestowne site, and her reconstructed face will be displayed at the Smithsonian museum. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/18cNUHU ||||| Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of \"Jane,\" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. \n \n May 1, 2013 Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of \"Jane,\" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.

The next set, after the body was rolled over, was more effective. One cut split the skull all the way to the base. \n \n \u201cThe person is truly figuring it out as they go,\u201d said Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution. \n \n In the meantime, someone \u2014 perhaps with more experience \u2014 was working on a leg. The tibia bone is broken with a single blow, as one might do in butchering a cow. \n \n That\u2019s one possible version of an event that took place sometime during the winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown. What\u2019s certain is that some members of that desperate colony resorted to cannibalism to survive. \n \n That cannibalism occurred during the colony\u2019s \u201cstarving time\u201d was never in much doubt. At least a half-dozen accounts, by people who lived through the period or spoke to colonists who did, describe occasional acts of cannibalism that winter. They include reports of corpses being exhumed and eaten, a husband killing his wife and salting her flesh (for which he was executed), and the mysterious disappearance of foraging colonists. \n \n This 14-year old girl was eaten. She has been reconstructed after archaeologists found her bones in Jamestown, Virginia. Her remains show that she died during the \u201cstarving time\u201d period and bare the telltale signs of cannibalism. (The Fold/The Washington Post) \n \n The proof comes in the form of fragments of a skeleton of a girl, about age 14, found in a cellar full of debris in the fort on the James River that sheltered the starving colonists. The skull, lower jaw and leg bone \u2014 all that remain \u2014 have the telltale marks of an ax or cleaver and a knife. \n \n \u201cHistorians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,\u201d said Owsley, who has examined thousands of skeletal remains, both archaeological and forensic. \u201cI think that it did. We didn\u2019t see anybody eat this flesh. But it\u2019s very strong evidence.\u201d \n \n James Horn, head of research at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and a historian on the colony, said the discovery \u201cadds a significant confirmation to what was reported to have occurred at Jamestown.\u201d Further, it\u2019s the only physical evidence of cannibalism of Europeans in any New World colony, although, as with Jamestown, there are written accounts of the practice in others. \n \n \u201cI tend to be sparing in the use of words like \u2018unique.\u2019 But I think this is one of those finds that literally is,\u201d Horn said. \n \n About 300 people inhabited the fort in November 1609. By spring, there were only 60. The girl, most likely a maidservant but possibly the daughter of a colonist, was one of the casualties. \n \n Her bones were unearthed last August as part of the Jamestown Rediscovery archaeological project begun in 1994. About 18 inches of fill remain in the cellar, so it\u2019s possible more of her skeleton will be found. Enough of her skull exists, however, to imagine what she might have looked like, using CT scanning, computer graphics, sculpture materials and demographic data. \n \n The bones, the reconstruction of her head and the story were presented Wednesday at an event at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History. The remains will be displayed at the Archaearium, the museum at the Jamestown fort archaeological site, starting this weekend. A warning sign at the room\u2019s entrance notes that human remains are on view. There are no depictions of bodies being butchered, cooked or consumed. \n \n The starving time nearly ended the colony, which was riven by internal dissent, under attack by Powhatan Indians and short of food almost from its founding in 1607. A resupply fleet of nine vessels had left Plymouth, England, on June 2, 1609. Aboard, including crew, were 500 people, of which perhaps three dozen were women and girls. The fleet was struck by a hurricane on July 23, 1609. One ship sank. The flagship, Sea Venture, wrecked on Bermuda. Most of the passengers and crew escaped to the island, an event that became the kernel of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d Among the survivors was the colony\u2019s incoming lieutenant governor, Thomas Gates. (The marooned fashioned two boats from the wreck\u2019s remains and miraculously sailed into Jamestown the next May.) \n \n The seven other ships, scattered and damaged, sailed on. Six arrived in mid-August, with the girl, whom the researchers have named \u201cJane,\u201d almost certainly on one of them. The seventh ship arrived in October. \n \n The new arrivals \u2014 about 300 people \u2014 proved to be as much a drain on the colony as a relief. \n \n The ships\u2019 crews hoarded provisions. The summer corn crop was enough to feed only about 50 people for a year. The colony\u2019s military leader, Capt. John Smith, sent two groups of colonists upstream and downstream to fend for themselves. He was badly wounded in what was probably an assassination attempt and in October sailed home with the ships. By then, people were already going hungry. \n \n The girl\u2019s bones were found mixed with those of a horse, dogs and squirrels \u2014 testament to the extreme food sources the colonists turned to that winter. They were part of the trash collected in a fort-wide cleanup and dumped in the cellar before the arrival of the colony\u2019s governor, Lord De La Warr, the following June. \n \n The cause of her death isn\u2019t known. The tentative cuts to the front of the skull and the deeper ones to the back are close together \u2014 evidence that she was dead, not squirming, when they were made. The temporal bone was pried off to reach the brain. There are dozens of cuts to the jaw, suggesting that muscle was stripped from it. \n \n Could the marks have been left by animals? \n \n \u201cNot a chance,\u201d Owsley said. \u201cI deal with this all the time. Not a chance.\u201d In fact, he says with confidence that the dissector or dissectors were right-handed. \n \n Chemical analysis of the bone reveals an enriched \u201cnitrogen profile,\u201d evidence of lots of protein in the girl\u2019s diet. That, in turn, suggests she was a member of a high-born family or at least lived in such a household for much of her life. \n \n She wouldn\u2019t have gone to Jamestown alone. Whoever accompanied her was probably dead by the time she became food for the starving. \u201cIf she\u2019d had a family to protect her \u2014 after death as well as before \u2014 this probably wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Horn said. \n \n Learning who she was will be difficult. Complete passenger lists for the voyages don\u2019t exist. Research into the Virginia Company\u2019s sponsors in Plymouth might reveal a family with a girl born in 1595 or 1596 who went to America. There may be extractable DNA in the bone fragments, but at this point, there are no descendants to compare it with. \n \n Even the appearance that Owsley and his collaborator, Kari Bruwelheide, gave the girl is to some extent guesswork. \n \n They used the thickness of facial tissue seen among girls in contemporary southern England to gauge Jane\u2019s. They gave her consensus hair \u2014 light brown \u2014 not the red or blond of other latitudes and regions. They also chose not to depict her as she undoubtedly was before death \u2014 gaunt and emaciated. \n \n \u201cBut I didn\u2019t make her look like a healthy, plump teenager either,\u201d Owsley said. \u201cI\u2019m putting her in her circumstances.\u201d \n \n Those include dirt on her face and a thousand-yard stare, but not, alas, her name.",

The fact that this is a compound that can be given orally, that gets into the brain and prevents brain disease, is a first in itself\u2026 We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.\u201d \n \n In debilitating brain diseases like Alzheimer's, the production of new proteins in the brain is shut down by a build-up of \u201cmisfolded proteins\u201d or amyloids. This build-up leads to an \u201cover-activation\u201d of a natural defence mechanism that stops essential proteins being produced. Without these proteins to protect them, brain cells die off - leading to the symptoms of diseases like Alzheimer's. \n \n The compound used in the study works by inhibiting an enzyme, known as PERK, which plays a key role in activating this defence mechanism. In mice with prion's disease, it restored proteins to protect brain cells \u201cstopping the disease in its tracks\u201d, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss. \n \n Although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice, including weight loss and mild diabetes, which was caused by damage to the pancreas, Professor Mallucci said it would \u201cnot be impossible\u201d to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been \u201cvery promising\u201d. \n \n The breakthrough was greeted with excitement by scientists, who nonetheless cautioned that it remained a significant proof of principle and a possible basis for new treatments, rather than a guarantee of an Alzheimer's cure in the near future. \n \n Computer graphic of a vertical (coronal) slice through the brain of an Alzheimer patient (credit: Science Photo Library) \n \n Professor Roger Morris, acting head King's College London's department of chemistry, said: \u201cThis is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer's disease. True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer's, that has been cured. However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer's disease in patients.\u201d \n \n \u201cFrom finding the first effective drug in a mouse, to having an effective medicine in man, usually takes decades to bring to fruition, in the very few cases in which it is successful. So, a cure for Alzheimer's is not just around the corner. However, the critical point of principle made by Professor Mallucci's study is that a drug, given orally, can arrest neurodegeneration caused by amyloid in the brain. \n \n \u201dThis finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease.\u201c \n \n David Allsopp, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University said that the study had thrown up \u201dvery dramatic and highly encouraging results\u201c, but said that more research was needed to overcome the \"problematic side-effects\" and to prove the technique would be effective against other disease like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. \n \n There are currently 800,000 people in the UK with dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause. The number of people living with the condition is set to break one million by 2021, and represents an enormous health burden for the NHS and the social care system. Parkinson's affect 1 in 500 people and around 127,000 people suffer from the condition. \n \n Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage. It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. While Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, other diseases that cause dementia are also characterised by the abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain. \n \n \u201cIf this process is also working overtime in these conditions too, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation. However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases.\u201d ||||| Scientists are hailing a landmark British study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by stopping the death of neurons. \n \n The Medical Research Council (MRC) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres. \n \n When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. \n \n Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \n \n But this research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. \n \n Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from \"off\" to \"on\" to prevent neurons dying. \n \n Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes and limb dragging. \n \n They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. \n \n During the study, a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice. \n \n Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause - misfolded proteins - as more common conditions such as Alzheimer's. \n \n Lead scientist Professor Giovanna Mallucci, from the MRC Toxicology Unit, said: \"We were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice.\" \n \n The scientists stress human trials are a long way off and point out that the mice suffered serious side effects, including significant weight loss and raised blood sugar. \n \n But they also believe the research demonstrates in principle the possibility of developing an oral treatment - a pill or swallowed liquid - that can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease. \n \n The research is at a very early stage and it could be a decade or more before the medicine is actually developed. \n \n But experts said the findings were highly significant. \n \n Professor Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: \"This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer's disease. \n \n \"True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer's, that has been cured. \n \n \"However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer's disease in patients.\" \n \n He added: \"This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease.\" \n \n Professor David Allsop, from the University of Lancaster, said: \"Inhibiting this pathway has produced some very dramatic and highly encouraging results in mice infected with prion disease. \n \n \"The main caveats of the research, however, are that prion disease is very rare in humans, and it is not yet clear if the same approach will be viable for much more common neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. \n \n \"More research is needed to determine if this approach is valid for any condition other than prion disease, and also to find ways of getting around these problematic side-effects.\"",
    "summary": "\u2013 Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \"shutdown,\" thus basically flipping the switch from \"off\" back to \"on.\" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes.

In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons (11.1 million metric tons), followed by the U.S. with about 11 million tons (10 million metric tons). \n \n However, the United States eclipses China in e-waste generation, because more products previously put on the market in the U.S. are likely to be retired. In 2012, the U.S. produced about 10.4 million tons (9.4 million metric tons), versus China's 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons). \n \n The U.S. generated the seventh highest amount of e-waste per person \u2014 about 66 lbs. (30 kg) per capita. (The country with the highest per capita e-waste was Qatar.) \n \n E-waste in the U.S. \n \n The U.S. National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER) and MIT have released a detailed report on U.S. generation, collection and export of used electronics in conjunction with the e-waste map. \n \n The U.S. generated about 258.2 million units of used computers, monitors, TVs and cellphones in 2010, 171.4 million of which were collected for recycling, and 14.4 million were exported, according to the report. [Green Guide to Holiday Electronic Gifts (Op-Ed)] \n \n The U.S. is a major exporter of used electronics. The U.S. exports more CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors by weight than any other product, and more cellphones than any other electronics product in terms of numbers. \n \n However, export numbers could be an underestimate, because exporters want to keep them quiet in order to bypass restrictions or bad press, said Jason Linnell, executive director of NCER. \n \n In terms of recycling, \"We are a little bit behind compared with countries in the European Union,\" Linnell told LiveScience.European countries have had established e-waste recycling programs for more than 10 years, whereas only 25 U.S. states have started similar programs, Linnell said. \n \n But recycling of e-waste is on the rise. \"We're seeing more recycling programs, and a lot of states are collecting 5 to 6 lbs. (2.3 to 2.7 kg) of e-waste per person per year,\" he said. \n \n \"It's better than the past, but we we still have a ways to go,\" Linnell said. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+.

Original article on LiveScience. ||||| It has been called the \u201cdirty underbelly\u201d of electronics. \n \n E-waste \u2014 all those discarded electrical or electronic devices, from cell phones and TVs to tablets and computers. \n \n The numbers are staggering. And now, a world e-waste map \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 shows just how staggering. \n \n The average Canadian, for example, generated about 24 kilograms of e-waste in 2012. That\u2019s more than 860,000 tonnes for the entire country, roughly equivalent to the weight of about 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s at take off. \n \n But the biggest producer of e-waste is the United States, with an astonishing 9,359,000 tonnes produced in 2012, about 29 kilograms per person, according to the map, which was created by a number of agencies through their \u201csolving e-waste problem\u201d (StEP) initiative. \n \n The numbers are mind-boggling, said Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University in St. John\u2019s, N.L., and a member of StEP. \n \n \u201cThe main purpose (of the map) is to give a sense how much electronic waste is present in any given any country,\u201d said Lepawsky. \n \n It also allows a comparison between purchasing power in different countries, which is a measure of wealth, he said. \n \n (The richer the country, the more e-waste it generally generates.) \n \n By 2017, the volume of discarded e-products worldwide is expected to be 33 per cent higher than in 2012 and weigh the equivalent of eight of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n Haiti is among the lowest producers of e-waste in the world, with less than 8,000 tonnes produced in 2012, or less than one kilogram per person. \n \n Afghanistan, too, was among the lowest in the world, with less than 19,000 tonnes of e-waste for the country, or 0.58 kilogram per person. \n \n The map is surprising in parts, said Lepawsky. \n \n Singapore is much wealthier than Canada, he said, \u201cwhen you look at e-waste generated.\u201d In Singapore, a tiny country, the average person generated about 36 kilograms in 2012. \n \n \u201cThe world is changing quite quickly,\u201d he said. \n \n Luxembourg is another example. \n \n It has a much smaller population than the U.S., 520,000, compared to more than 314 million, but more new electrical and electronic equipment comes to the market in Luxembourg per capita. \n \n (The U.S. is the largest consumer in absolute terms but it is behind Luxembourg in per capita terms.) \n \n It is a disheartening number, said Miriam Diamond, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of Toronto, referring to the e-waste that emanates from Canada. \n \n \u201cIt represents throwing away a tremendous amount of energy that went into making it in the first place.\u201d \n \n Used electronics often make their way to the developing world where some are reused. \n \n But, Diamond says, \u201cIn a lot of the recycling sector, they are dismantled by hand. That is a serious threat to health and the environment.\u201d \n \n Innovation is a trademark in the world of electronics, especially in the world of cellphones, laptops and computers, where engineers come up with distinct, sleek styles to lure people to buy more. \n \n \u201cWhy won\u2019t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?\u201d she asked. \n \n The cost of mining new resources is also staggering. \n \n \u201cThese minerals that we mine are scarce. . . is it worth it? Mining, too, has negative impact on people and places.\u201d \n \n For Lepawsky, the solution to the tonnes of e-waste is relatively simple. \n \n \u201cStop buying new electronics; use what you have for longer,\u201d he said, adding that sometimes buying new products is about fashion more than anything else. ||||| An employee holds circuit boards at the Coopermiti warehouse of electronic waste in Sao Paulo March 6, 2013. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brazil generates the greatest amount of electronic waste (e-waste) per capita among emerging countries. \n \n OSLO (Reuters) - China and other emerging economies have overtaken Western nations in dumping old electronic goods, from TVs to cellphones, and will lead a projected 33 percent surge in the amount of waste from 2012 to 2017, a U.N.-backed alliance said on Sunday. \n \n The report, the first to map electronic waste by country to promote recycling and safer disposal of often toxic parts, shows how the economic rise of developing nations is transforming the world economy even in terms of pollution. \n \n \"The e-waste problem requires attention globally,\" Ruediger Kuehr of the U.N. University and executive secretary of the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) initiative, told Reuters. StEP is run by U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists. \n \n The weight of electronic goods discarded every year worldwide would rise to 65.4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48.9 million in 2012, with most of the growth in developing nations, StEP said. \n \n By 2017, it would make the annual piles of old washing machines, computers, fridges, electronic toys and other goods with an electric cord or battery the weight equivalent of 200 Empire State Buildings or 11 Great Pyramids of Giza, it said. \n \n Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it. \n \n Waste from emerging countries, as well as Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations, overtook totals from Western nations such as the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia around 2012, StEP data showed. \n \n In that year, the West produced 23.5 million tonnes of waste and all others 25.4 million, a shift from the previous estimates for 2007 when the West accounted for most, StEP said. \n \n MOUNTAINS OF TRASH \n \n By 2017, trash from the West would rise to 28.6 million tonnes, far less than the 36.7 million from other countries, a side-effect of the economic rise of emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa. \n \n \"Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,\" Kuehr said in the report. \n \n Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said. \n \n Waste can be valuable if recycled. One study estimated that a million cellphones can yield 24 kg (53 lb) of gold, 250 kg of silver, 9 kg of palladium and more than 9 tonnes of copper. \n \n Sunday's report also showed that the average person on the planet produces 7 kg of electronic waste every year. Americans were among the highest with 29.8 kg each. \n \n Separately, U.S.-based experts trying to track the fate of waste said that about two-thirds of U.S. electronics waste is collected for re-use or recycling and that only 8.5 percent of the collected units are exported. \n \n Bigger electronic items, especially TVs and computer monitors, were exported to nations including Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay and China, it said. Smaller items often went to Asia. \n \n Jeremy Gregory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report, told Reuters it was hard to track trade because the waste is often merely described as \"mixed metals\" on import documents. \n \n StEP urged nations to adopt clearer trade descriptions. \n \n For StEP maps, click here: here \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams)",
    "summary": "\u2013 Electronic waste is growing at a staggering rate\u2014Americans alone chucked an average of 65 pounds of old electronic goods each last year\u2014and it is set to surge another 33% within five years unless consumers and producers change their ways, LiveScience reports. Most of the waste ends up in developing nations, and those countries plus the former Soviet bloc now produce more electronic waste of their own than Western nations, according to a new map that tracks the problem worldwide for the first time. The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable\u2014a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes\u2014recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health.

    "document": "\"Tonight Show\" host Jay Leno is taking a significant reduction in pay and roughly two dozen staffers are being let go as part of a major budget restructuring at the late-night talk show. \n \n Although \"The Tonight Show\" remains the top-rated late-night program, from a financial standpoint it is only break-even, according to a person familiar with the economics of the show. One reason for that is that the production budget of the show was not reduced when Leno moved back to late night after his ill-fated stint in prime time during the 2009-10 television season. \n \n Leno's current salary is between $25 million and $30 million and he volunteered to take a cut if it would save some jobs. A person close to the network thought Leno's new salary is likely around $20 million. Bruce Bobbins, one of Leno's spokesmen, declined to comment. \n \n [Updated at 10:49 a.m., Aug. 18: In a statement later Bobbins said, \"Jay's foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for 'The Tonight Show.' He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.\"] \n \n While an NBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the situation, the job losses are said to be between 20 and 25 people and many other senior staffers also agreed to pay cuts. \n \n The weekly budget for Leno's prime time show was approximately $2.3 million and it stayed there when he returned to late night and Conan O'Brien was sent packing. The budget now will be closer to $1.7 million, which is in the range of what it was during Leno's previous late-night stint. \n \n Leno is not the first late-night host to agree to a salary reduction. In 2009, CBS restructured David Letterman's deal and reduced his salary and the budget of the show. \n \n Whether NBC will look to other areas to make additional cuts is yet to be determined. Earlier this year, the network trimmed its marketing and promotions staff. \n \n News of the cuts were first reported by Deadline Hollywood. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Movie review: 'Cosmopolis' \n \n Moviegoers still wary of theaters after Aurora shootings \n \n Robert Pattinson tries to separate professional and personal lives ||||| Related: Tonight Show Cuts Latest In Wave Of NBC Layoffs & Cost Trims Imposed By Comcast \n \n SATURDAY UPDATE: Jay Leno\u2019s spokesman has now issued this statement: \u201dJay\u2019s foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for The Tonight Show. He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.\u201d \n \n BREAKING\u2026 EXCLUSIVE\u2026 FRIDAY 8:30 PM: NBC insiders tell me The Tonight Show went through \u201ddownsizing\u201d today and that 20 staffers lost their jobs. Others tell me the number is more like 25, and producers were forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs. I\u2019ve also learned that Jay Leno took what is being described as a \u201ctremendous\u201d pay cut to \u201csave as many people\u2019s jobs as he could\u201d. Leno\u2019s Tonight Show is consistently the #1 late night talk show in both households and demographics, except for some anomalies when Leno does get beaten. And that\u2019s despite the fact that the network\u2019s primetime ratings have been dismal for many years or that Leno himself was harshly criticized by the media for that January 2010 standoff with Conan O\u2019Brien. Even so, The Tonight Show has been and still is a cash cow for NBC. So what happened to merit the downsizing? \u201cI don\u2019t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,\u201d an NBC insider tells me. \u201dIt\u2019s hard to go through those kinds of cuts. It\u2019s more a network issue than a late-night issue. And I would say that Jay doesn\u2019t get credit for digging out of a gigantic hole every single night. He\u2019s a very valuable guy to NBC and someday everyone will understand that. He does a great job.\u201d \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 A Bump \n \n The downsizing also comes just 5 days after First Lady Michelle Obama appeared as a guest for the third time on The Tonight Show: high unemployment, job creation, and taxing the rich vs the poor all are issues in the 2012 president campaign. Leno has said publicly that he\u2019s able to bank his entire Tonight Show salary and live on the hefty fees he makes from his hectic personal appearance schedule. Leno\u2019s new salary is reportedly $27M-$30 million a year. He reportedly brings home another $15M-$20M a year from his other gigs. \n \n Leno replaced Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show in 1992 after having been a regular substitute host since 1987. He \u201cofficially\u201d ended hosting of The Tonight Show in 2009 when Conan O\u2019Brien started on June 1st. Leno was going to be paid for all of 2009 by NBC even though he was only working six months of it. When his ratings dipped, O\u2019Brien was asked to move The Tonight Show\u2018s time slot later to make room for Leno\u2019s return at 11:30 PM. O\u2019Brien refused. NBC gave Conan a $40M payoff (including salaries for his staff) to leave The Tonight Show hosting job which Leno resumed in 2010. \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 A Bump \n \n Jay Leno Celebrates 20th Anniversary Hosting \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 \n \n Jimmy Kimmel Bests Leno & Letterman \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Jay Leno has long said he lives off his standup money and takes the millions he gets paid for hosting the Tonight Show and sticks it right in the bank. So the news that Nikki Finke at Deadline Hollywood broke last night might not sting quite as much for him: One source tells her that Leno took a \"tremendous\" pay cut, and the LA Times confirms it was indeed \"significant.\" The numbers require some guesswork, but the LAT thinks he went from somewhere between $25 million and $30 million down to about $20 million. Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around. She says the show is still a \"cash cow.\" The LAT, meanwhile, says Leno's prime-time budget never got shaved when he moved back to later hours."

These really do appear to be quite specific to Alzheimer's,\" Kodadek said. \n \n They also used the test on blood from 200 elderly people not suffering from dementia and found 8 percent had elevated concentrations of the same antibodies found in Alzheimer's patients, which suggests the test may work as an early predictor of disease. ||||| Executive Health \n \n Early Steps Toward an Alzheimer's Blood Test \n \n Different immune system proteins exist in the blood of people with the disease, study finds \n \n THURSDAY, Jan. 6 (HealthDay News) -- A blood test that screens for antibodies, a protein produced by the immune system, may one day be used to detect Alzheimer's and other diseases, new research suggests. \n \n Though the research is still in its infancy, being able to detect Alzheimer's via antibodies would be a simpler and less invasive method of diagnosing the disease, researchers said. \n \n But the study's lead author stressed that the true benefits of such a test for Alzheimer's patients won't really arise until scientists develop effective treatments against the disease. \n \n \"It's unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get Alzheimer's if they can't do anything about it,\" said Thomas Kodadek, a professor of chemistry and cancer biology at The Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Fla. \"But I can say with some certainty that we will never get a good therapy for Alzheimer's without early diagnosis.\" \n \n The study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is published in the Jan. 7 issue of Cell. \n \n Typically, in developing blood tests for diseases, researchers have searched for antigens -- that is, proteins from a virus, bacteria or other disease process such as cancer or neurological conditions like Alzheimer's -- that set off an immune response. \n \n Only after identifying the antigen would researchers then search for antibodies to that antigen, or signs that the immune system had picked up on the problem and mounted a response. \n \n But antigens can be difficult to find, Kodadek explained. \n \n \"In Alzheimer's, or in a disease such as cancer, it's not at all obvious what the initiating event is,\" he said. \"We just don't know what are those first weirdly modified proteins that are unique to the disease process that the immune system 'sees.'\" \n \n The new research went about things differently. Rather than search for the elusive antigen, researchers did \"high throughput\" screening using thousands of synthetic molecules, called peptoids, that would bind with the antibodies. \n \n Comparing blood samples from six Alzheimer's patients, six healthy people and six Parkinson's disease patients, the researchers found that two of the thousands of synthetic molecules \"captured\" at least three-fold more immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies from all six of the Alzheimer's patients than from either the healthy controls or the Parkinson's patients. \n \n The synthetic molecules, in effect, acted as a lure for the antibodies -- enabling the researchers to spot biomarkers in the blood unique to those with Alzheimer's. \n \n This process could be repeated to test for antibodies associated with other diseases as well, Kodadek theorized. \n \n \"The big advance from what people have been doing before is that this method completely removes the requirement of knowing the native antigens that triggered the immune response,\" Kodadek said. \"The real excitement is it should allow us to identify biomarkers for any disease for which the immune system reacts.\" \n \n The synthetic molecules are easily modifiable and can be produced quickly in large quantities at lower cost, Kodadek said. \n \n However, while promising, the results are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger numbers of patients, noted Dr. Jeremy Koppel, an Alzheimer's research scientist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y. He was not involved in the new research. \n \n \"This study represents a novel approach to the development of a noninvasive screening instrument for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, which currently lack definitive diagnostic biomarkers,\" Koppel said. \"Beyond diagnostics, the future identification of the biomarkers detected in this study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the disease process itself.\" \n \n Another caveat is that the study was done in people who already had Alzheimer's, not those merely at risk for the disease. Further research needs to be done to determine how soon into the progression of the disease the abnormal antibodies can be detected. \n \n Right now, there are a few medications that can help with the symptoms of Alzheimer's, but there are no treatments that slow the progression of the disease. \n \n So for many patients, early diagnosis may not necessarily be something they want, Kodadek said. But from a research perspective, early diagnosis is a key to developing better treatment, he added. \n \n With neurodegenerative diseases, the hope is that drugs could block further decline, making it crucial to know if a person has the disease before they begin having significant symptoms, he said. \n \n More information \n \n The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more on Alzheimer's. \n \n SOURCES: Thomas Kodadek, Ph.D., professor, chemistry and cancer biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, Fla; Jeremy Koppel, M.D., Alzheimer's research scientist, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, N.Y.; Jan. 7, 2011, Cell \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2011 HealthDay.

It says Bishop Burns was \u201cprepared to announce the allegations in March\u201d but there was \u201cconcern for the victims\u201d who asked that it not be made public. \n \n The statement goes on to say Bishop Burns tried to be sensitive to the victim\u2019s request.

(Photo by Todd Williamson/Invision for LA friendly House/File) (Associated Press) \n \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 Author and actor Christopher Kennedy Lawford, who was born into political and Hollywood royalty, sank into substance abuse and addiction and rose to become a well-known advocate for sobriety and recovery, has died. \n \n Lawford died of a heart attack Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, his cousin, former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, told The Associated Press. He was 63. \n \n Lawford was in Vancouver living with his girlfriend and working to open a recovery center. He had been doing hot yoga, which he did often, but the strain of it \"must have been too much for him at that point,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was the only son and oldest child of Patricia Kennedy \u2014 sister of John, Robert and Ted Kennedy \u2014 and Peter Lawford \u2014 the English actor and socialite who was a member of Frank Sinatra's \"Rat Pack.\" \n \n \"I was given wealth, power and fame when I drew my first breath,\" Lawford wrote in his 2005 book, \"Symptoms of Withdrawal: A Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption,\" the first of several books he wrote about his substance struggles. \n \n He wrote that his parents got telegrams predicting big things for him from Bing Crosby and Dean Martin and said he once got a lesson in doing \"The Twist\" from Marilyn Monroe. The cover of his books shows him sitting poolside as a child with his uncle and soon-to-be-president John F. Kennedy looming behind him. \n \n He spent his youth frolicking with Hollywood stars on one coast and rubbing shoulders with political stars on the other, living between libertine Los Angeles and the hyper-competitive Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where he was a big-brother figure to John F. Kennedy Jr. \n \n \"You can't get much more fawned over than being a Kennedy male,\" Lawford wrote. \n \n His life with drugs began with LSD while at boarding school at age 14. In the years before he had experienced the assassinations of his two uncles and his parents' divorce in 1966. \n \n With heroin and other opioids as his substances of choice, Lawford leapt into deeper substance abuse in drug-heavy 1970s Hollywood, where his father also abused drugs and alcohol as his career faded. Peter Lawford died in 1984. Patricia Kennedy died in 2006. \n \n In his memoir, Christopher Lawford told tales of mugging women for money, panhandling in Grand Central Station and getting arrested twice for drug possession before getting sober at 30. \n \n \"There are many days when I wish I could take back and use my youth more appropriately,\" Lawford told The Associated Press in 2005. \"But all of that got me here.

Kennedy, said his cousin \"did something very difficult,\" airing family secrets and temporarily hurting his relationships within the Kennedy clan when he wrote his book. \n \n \"He had the courage to know that he had to find himself, and he wasn't going to be able to do it while holding on to the old family narrative,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was \"tormented by the fact\" that for a time he was estranged from his sisters, Patrick Kennedy said. \n \n \"Over the years of recovery, he ended up reconciling with his sisters, happiest I ever saw him,\" Kennedy said. \n \n His life's work became helping others recover \u2014 including his cousin. \n \n \"He was the absolute cornerstone to my sobriety, along with my wife,\" Patrick Kennedy said (the former politician had been addicted to drugs and alcohol). \"He was the one who walked me through all the difficult days of that early period.\" \n \n After his memoir, Lawford authored several more books on addiction and recovery, most recently 2015's \"What Addicts Know.\" \n \n He worked steadily as an actor, with moderate success. He had a small part in 2003's \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\" made appearances on TV shows including \"Frazier\" and \"The O.C.\" and had recurring roles on the soaps \"All My Children\" and \"General Hospital,\" playing a senator in the latter. \n \n He told the AP in 2005 that his famous dual identities both helped and hurt him in Hollywood. \n \n \"The names give you entree, absolutely, but it's a kind of a double-edged sword,\" he said. \"People do pay attention to you, but nobody gets ahead in Hollywood unless they are really lucky or they deserve it.\" \n \n He is survived by his sisters, Sydney, Victoria and Robin, and his children, David, Savannah and Matt. \n \n ___ \n \n Dalton reported from Los Angeles. ||||| JFK's Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n JFK's Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n 10:45 AM PT: Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Lawford was at a yoga studio Tuesday night when he had a medical emergency and later died.

    "document": "Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement \u2014 coming on the heels of the chaotic, ugly realpolitik that followed Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death \u2014 is a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is. \n \n In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia\u2019s death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the Supreme Court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50 percent of the time. \n \n Democrats, infuriated by the GOP\u2019s treatment of President Obama and Merrick Garland, filibustered Neil Gorsuch \u2014 the kind of broadly qualified nominee who would\u2019ve passed easily in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \n \n What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls \u201cSenate syndrome\u201d: One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins. That\u2019s now happened with Supreme Court nominations. \n \n Here, in truth, is where the past few years have left us. The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power over Supreme Court picks. The majority party can and will jam whomever they want onto the Court, where that person will serve for life. But in times when the Senate and the White House are controlled by different parties \u2014 which happens fairly often \u2014 there\u2019s almost no chance that any seat on the Court will be filled. \n \n Imagine, for a minute, that Democrats win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires in 2019. What are the chances, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats will permit Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court? I\u2019d guess somewhere between zero and zero. \n \n This is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful institutions in American life. But the decorous, gentle equilibrium of yesteryear was also nonsensical. There\u2019s always been something bizarre about the idea that a position as important, as long-serving, and as irreversible as Supreme Court justice should be made based on qualifications rather than ideology. \n \n Politics isn\u2019t a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 competition, it\u2019s a contest for power, and the wielding of that power has real consequences. In practice, the Supreme Court decides how elections are funded, whether abortions are legal, whether millions of people will continue to have health insurance \u2014 if elected politicians and activist groups see its composition as a matter of life and death, that\u2019s because it often is. \n \n Yes, Garland was relatively moderate, but if he had replaced Scalia, he would\u2019ve swung the Court to a 5-4 liberal majority, leading to a slew of transformative rulings Republicans would find abhorrent. Yes, Gorsuch was qualified, but he has ruled in ways Democrats find awful, and the clarity of his opinions will not soften their effects. \n \n For that reason, I don\u2019t blame Republicans for blocking Garland. Nor do I blame Democrats for filibustering Gorsuch. And I do not expect Republicans to give Democrats a sliver of oversight over Kennedy\u2019s replacement. \n \n But the result of both sides taking SCOTUS nominations as seriously as they deserve to be taken is disastrous \u2014 it will become common for seats on the Court, perhaps multiple at one time, to remain open for years, and when they are filled, they will be filled with more extreme candidates. \n \n The core problem here is the stakes of Supreme Court nominations: They\u2019re too damn high. Candidates serve for life \u2014 which, given modern life spans and youthful nominees, can now mean 40 years of decisions \u2014 and no one knows when the next seat will open. President Jimmy Carter served four years and saw no open seats. President George H.W. Bush served four years and filled two. Barack Obama served eight years and named two justices. Donald Trump isn\u2019t even two years into his presidency and he\u2019s already been given two vacancies. \n \n The result isn\u2019t merely an undemocratic branch of government but a randomly undemocratic branch of government. And that randomness, and the stakes of seeing it play out in your side\u2019s favor, makes it necessary to turn Supreme Court nominations into bloodsport. It creates incentives for justices to stay on the bench long after the point at which they should\u2019ve retired, in the hopes that they can outlast an ideologically unfriendly administration \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, is 85, but it\u2019s hard to imagine she won\u2019t do everything in her physical power to hang onto her seat until a Democrat can replace her. It biases presidents toward nominating the youngest qualified jurist they can find, rather than the best jurist they can find. \n \n We need to deescalate Supreme Court fights. The most obvious way to do that is to limit terms. Holding justices to a 10-year, nonrenewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination as well as make the timing of fights more predictable. An idea like this could have bipartisan support \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry proposed 18-year terms in the 2012 campaign, making an argument that I think sounds even more persuasive today: \n \n Doing this would move the court closer to the people by ensuring that every President would have the opportunity to replace two Justices per term, and that no court could stretch its ideology over multiple generations. Further, this reform would maintain judicial independence, but instill regularity to the nominations process, discourage Justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics, and will stop the ever-increasing tenure of Justices. \n \n Implementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws. ||||| The fight over President Trump Donald John TrumpScaramucci warns Trump must 'change tactics now' on trade Trump sought to purchase historic Scottish building for hotel: report Republican wins right to replace Farenthold in Congress MORE\u2019s next nomination to the Supreme Court began almost immediately after the news broke of the opening on Wednesday. \n \n Moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would retire, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSunday shows preview: Supreme Court fight in the spotlight Appeals court nominees languish in Senate as Flake demands tariff vote Gillibrand incorrectly claims no Democrats voted for Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee MORE (R-Ky.) said the Senate would act before the midterm election to confirm Trump\u2019s next nominee. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n \u201cWe will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy\u2019s successor this fall,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \n \n Democrats immediately cried foul, arguing the nomination fight should come next year. \n \n Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOvernight Health Care: Judge blocks Kentucky Medicaid work requirements | Trump officials consider cuts to ObamaCare outreach | House probes HHS office in charge of migrant children Overnight Health Care: Amazon enters the pharmacy business | Two Republicans to play pivotal role in Supreme Court abortion fight | Senate panel approves medical research boost Lewandowski: Pelosi is not the leader of the Democratic Party MORE (N.Y.), recalling the bitter fight over Merrick Garland Merrick Brian GarlandBattle over Trump court pick to be most expensive ever Mitch McConnell\u2019s gamble is about to pay off \u2014 big time Dem senator: No argument will 'lay bare' GOP's hypocrisy on Supreme Court MORE\u2019s nomination to the court in 2016, demanded that McConnell hold off until a new Congress is seated in 2019.

    "summary": "\u2013 The fallout from Anthony Kennedy's bombshell decision to retire from the Supreme Court continues to resonate, with President Trump saying he's \"honored\" that Kennedy has given him an opportunity to pick a successor. Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions."

    "document": "Image copyright PA Image caption Police said the suspected drone had struck an inbound Airbus A320, similar to this one \n \n A police investigation is under way after a passenger plane approaching Heathrow Airport flew into what is believed to have been a drone. \n \n The British Airways flight from Geneva, with 132 passengers and five crew on board, was hit as it approached the London airport at 12:50 BST on Sunday. \n \n If confirmed, it is thought it would be the first such incident in the UK. \n \n BA said it would give the police \"every assistance with their investigation\". No arrests have been made, police say. \n \n The Metropolitan Police said the plane was hit by the drone at about 1,700ft (580m) while flying over the area of Richmond Park, in south west London. \n \n No debris has been found and police have asked for anyone who finds drone parts in the Richmond area to come forward. \n \n The force's aviation security unit, based at Heathrow, is leading the investigation. \n \n 'Very real danger' \n \n After safely landing the plane, the pilot reported an object had struck the front of the Airbus A320. \n \n A BA spokesman said: \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight.\" \n \n Chief Superintendent Martin Hendy, head of the Met's aviation policing command, said the incident highlighted \"the very real dangers of reckless, negligent and some times malicious use of drones\". \n \n A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesman said it was \"totally unacceptable\" to fly drones - which are generally used to capture aerial film or photographs - close to airports. \n \n Steve Landells, from the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said it had been \"only a matter of time before we had a drone strike\". He called for greater enforcement of existing rules. \n \n Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? \n \n London music video drone footage draws criticism \n \n The rules for flying domestic drones \n \n Analysis \n \n Image copyright PA \n \n Leo Kelion, Technology editor \n \n Flying a drone near an airport can already be punished with up to five years in prison, and rules also forbid flying them \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of the operator or near buildings and crowds of people. Drones may not fly above 400ft (122m). \n \n But the latest incident will only add to the pressure for further steps to be taken. \n \n The US recently introduced a compulsory registration scheme so any drone recovered from an accident can be traced back to its owner. \n \n In addition, officials could make it mandatory for drones to run geo-fencing software - that would prevent them flying in restricted areas. \n \n The Department for Transport has promised to publish a strategy for unmanned aircraft this year. \n \n Pilots have also called for it to fund tests into what would happen if a drone got sucked into an engine or crashed into a plane's windscreen. \n \n Last month, the British Airline Pilots Association noted that while the threat of bird strikes had been well researched, there was little data about how much damage a drone could cause a plane. \n \n The incident follows a warning earlier this year by the head of the International Air Transport Association Tony Tyler that drones flown by the general public are \"a real and growing threat\" to civilian aircraft. \n \n The UK Air Proximity Board - which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace - said there had been a number of serious near-misses at UK airports involving drones. \n \n David Black, from Blackwing Aerial Services - a company that specialises in licensed commercial drones - said education and enforcement of the current rules were important, particularly for hobbyists. \n \n \"I think a register is a good idea,\" he said. \n \n \"With firearms it has shown it's a good thing... but it has not stopped bad guys from getting guns. If you're going to use them as weapons, bad guys can build them themselves. \n \n \"You need enforcement, but the problem with enforcement is that it costs money and people to carry it out.... There needs to be better technology for detection and avoidance.\" \n \n Geo-fencing is available in some drones - a database within the drone will not let it take off if it is near an airport so that operators cannot accidentally fly into trouble. \n \n Mr Landells from Balpa added: \"The law as it stands says you're not supposed to go above 400ft (122m) or 500m away from the base unit, depending on the drone you're using, but we've been seeing incidents up at 8,000 feet, where drones just have no place to be, so we've got to do something. \n \n \"That's a registration process, some sort of tracking, some sort of electronic security - we've got to do something about this.\" \n \n Drone incidents at UK airports \n \n Image copyright BAA \n \n 17 April 2016 - A British Airways plane approaching Heathrow is believed to have hit a drone while in midair \n \n 28 November 2015 - The pilot of an A321 plane narrowly missed a drone hovering at 100ft above a runway at Gatwick Airport \n \n 30 September 2015 - A small drone helicopter passed within 30ft of the cockpit of an A319 plane while on the approach to Heathrow \n \n 22 September 2015 - A \"quadcopter-type drone\" missed the right-hand side of a B777 plane by about 25m while at 2,000ft after it left Heathrow Airport \n \n 13 September 2015 - A silver drone with a \"balloon-like\" centre missed an E170 aircraft by about 20m, while the plane was approaching London City Airport over the Thames \n \n 13 September 2015 - A drone flew over the top of a B737 aircraft while at 4,000ft, missing it by about 5m, shortly after it left Stansted \n \n 27 August 2015 - A DO328 aircraft flew within 50ft of a drone while approaching Manchester Airport at 2,800ft \n \n Source: The UK Airprox Board ||||| Story highlights London police seek public's help in finding operator of drone that may have struck airliner \n \n No one was hurt and the plane wasn't damaged, but authorities worry about potential for catastrophe \n \n London (CNN) Did a drone hit an airliner trying to land at London's Heathrow Airport? \n \n The pilot of a British Airways flight certainly thinks so, and now authorities would like to find out who might have been behind the weekend incident. \n \n British Airways Flight BA727 from Geneva was approaching Heathrow on Sunday afternoon when what the pilot believed to be a drone struck the front of the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said.

It has been used by tens of thousands of migrants to enter the European Union's Schengen zone, which allows people to travel between countries without restrictions. \n \n The BBC's James Reynolds, at the scene, reports that migrants stranded on the Serbian side chanted \"Open open\", and threw plastic water bottles at the police, who forced the crowd back by firing tear gas. \n \n More on the migrant crisis: \n \n The refugees who chose Brazil over Europe \n \n Five 'happy refugees' pictures that went viral \n \n Crisis explained in graphics \n \n The BBC's Lyse Doucet says buses, vans and cars have been taking migrants away from the Serbia-Hungary border area towards the Serbian capital, Belgrade, and the border with Croatia. \n \n Hungary declared a state of emergency in the border area on Tuesday, with hundreds of army and police deployed to enforce new laws making it an offence to breach a razor-wire border fence. \n \n The first trials of refugees detained for illegal border crossing have been held in the Hungarian city of Szeged. \n \n Ahmed Suadi Talib, an Iraqi who was studying in Syria, was the first to be convicted under the new law, and was excluded from Hungary for one year. \n \n Speaking through a translator, he told the court he had fled Syria to escape Islamic State. He entered Hungary via a hole in the border fence, he said, and did not know crossing into Hungary was illegal. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Reynolds is at the legal crossing point from Serbia into Hungary but says the door is currently locked \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Christian Fraser on the Hungarian side of the border fence notices some weak points. \n \n The EU's border agency says more than 500,000 migrants have arrived at the EU's borders so far this year, compared with 280,000 in 2014. \n \n Many are fleeing conflict and poverty in countries including Syria, where a civil war has been raging since 2011. \n \n The migrants have been crossing from Turkey, with about 1,000 in the city of Edirne on Wednesday, waiting to organise a crossing into Greece.

Already, the migrant trail was adapting, finding new ways to reach western Europe. ||||| Refugees blazed a new pathway through Europe on Wednesday, with hundreds hiking through cornfields to reach welcoming Croatia even as others faced tear gas and water cannons from Hungarian police determined to turn them away. \n \n The contrasting scenes along the Serbian border highlighted both the make-or-break resolve of the asylum seekers and the growing friction facing Europe, which has failed to create a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx of economic migrants and war refugees from the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n \n \u201cWe hit a stone and we flow around it,\u201d said Arazak Dubal, 28, a computer programmer from Damascus, who had been on the road for 18 days. \n \n He and his three companions reached Belgrade only to discover on Facebook and WhatsApp that the Hungarian border was closed to refugees. \n \n \u201cSo I went to Google Maps, and here we are,\u201d said Dubal, huffing in the hot afternoon as he trudged across the farm fields. \n \n \n \n \n \n A two-hour drive to the northeast \u2014 along Serbia\u2019s frontier with Hungary \u2014 the route was slammed shut. \n \n Just steps from Hungary, thousands of people spent the night in the wet grass on the Serbian side of the border. Hours later, hundreds tried to punch through the cordon of razor wire and riot police massed near the Serbian border town of Horgos. \n \n But they ran headlong into security forces\u00ad who unleashed tear gas and pepper spray to drive them back. Some refugees were swatted by batons and crumpled to the ground in pain. \n \n [New threat on the refu\u00adgee trail: land mines] \n \n \u201cOpen the door!\u201d the refugees yelled as they hurled water bottles and debris at riot police. \n \n Nearby, children screamed for their missing parents. Water cannons sprayed crowds on the Serbian side, forcing refugees to retreat to a squalid squatters\u2019 camp that took root just after Hungary closed the border Tuesday. \n \n There were no major injuries, but some refugees were treated by Serbian authorities for respiratory problems from the tear gas and at least one migrant had a leg injury, the Associated Press reported. \n \n It was the first major clash between security forces\u00ad and migrants since police used stun grenades to stop refugees from crossing into Macedonia from Greece almost a month ago. \n \n \u201cWe fled wars and violence and did not expect such brutality and inhumane treatment in Europe,\u201d said Amir Hassan, who was drenched from a water cannon and tried to wash tear gas from his eyes, according to AP. \n \n \u201cShame on you Hungarians!\u201d he shouted, pointing toward the Hungarian police. \n \n At the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Hungary\u2019s border crackdowns \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \n \n \u201cAll the countries have their domestic problems,\u201d he said, \u201cbut since they are the people fleeing the wars and persecutions, then we must show our compassionate leadership.\u201d \n \n Neighboring countries continued to heap scorn on Hungary\u2019s decision to blocks its southern border. \n \n \u201cBarbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it\u2019s a threat,\u201d complained Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, in a direct jab at the blockades by neighboring Hungary. \n \n Milanovic promised that refugees would be allowed to pass through his country. \n \n He told lawmakers in Zagreb that Croatia would \u201caccept and direct\u201d the migrants to transit the country \u2014 comments that rocketed through the social media networks used by the refugees and increased the march toward Croatia. \n \n [ The limbo of the no man\u2019s land ] \n \n The river of migrants was swelling by the hour. \n \n By late afternoon, more than 600 migrants walked through fields and along small roads to cross from Serbia into Croatia, a European Union member, where officials set up posts to register names and details. \n \n Many traveled by bus from Macedonia and Hungary; others pulled up in taxis before crossing the border on foot and receiving a polite reception from authorities. \n \n \u201cWe want to keep them moving as quickly as possible,\u201d said Zdravko Helic, a civil protection officer in Tovarnik. \n \n He was proud to add, \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a single incident.\u201d \n \n Saeed, 19, a student from Damascus, called Hungary\u2019s treatment of the refugees \u201cold-fashioned racism.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re the first today,\u201d said Dubal, the Syrian refugee. \u201cThere\u2019ll be thousands tomorrow.\u201d \n \n Afterward they were taken by bus to a refugee processing camp outside the capital, Zagreb, where they would be officially registered. \n \n What happens after Zagreb was uncertain. \n \n Croatian officials said they would probably allow the migrants to continue their journeys by bus and train to Slovenia, Austria, Germany and beyond. But it was only Croatia\u2019s first day at the leading edge of the mass migration, and authorities were scrambling to coordinate their response with E.U. partners. \n \n \u201cWe will walk all the way to Germany if we have to,\u201d said Mohammad, 28, who worked in a mobile phone store in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city. \n \n \u201cShop is gone, house is gone, some of family is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I will walk.\u201d \n \n Like many in the migrant stream, he declined to give his last name out of fear of reprisals against relatives back home. \n \n The refugees had nothing good to say about Hungary. \u201cNot nice at all,\u201d said Abdullah, 24, from Aleppo, who smiled and waved at the Croatian police before they hustled him into a van. \n \n \u201cSee?

In a Sept. 8 Bloomberg TV interview, Sawiris said the proposal was something motivated by a desire \u201cto clear my conscience as a human being, and nothing more.\u201d \n \n The best way to deal with donations would be to set up a joint-stock company with a capital of $100 million, Sawiris said in his Facebook statement.

    "summary": "\u2013 More than 500 migrants have been detained for illegally entering Hungary or breaching a border fence, with nearly 50 criminal cases on the books since new laws took effect yesterday, the New York Times reports, while the BBC notes that Hungarian riot police today fired tear gas at migrants trying to break through the border with Serbia. And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into Western Europe through Slovenia and Croatia, as well as through Hungary's border with Romania. Issues remain: Hungary\u2019s poorer neighbors may be ill-equipped to handle the flow, and there are areas peppered with land mines, remnants of the Balkan Wars. While solutions are sought, thousands spent last night in a Vienna train station, per the Times, while at least 22 migrants drowned yesterday in the Aegean Sea, the Post notes\u2014a sad repeat of a similar incident a couple of days earlier. Leaders of neighboring nations are scrambling to come up with their own plans for dealing with the influx, which is no small task: The EU border agency notes a head count of 500,000 migrants at EU nations' entry points so far in 2015; last year that number was around 280,000, the BBC reports. Many are refugees fleeing high-conflict areas such as Syria and Iraq, per the Washington Post, which adds there's a noted \"absence of a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx.\" \"Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it's a threat,\" Croatia's PM says, per the Post, adding that Croatia would \"accept and direct\" migrants through his country. An Egyptian billionaire who says he wants \"to clear my conscience as a human being\" has come up with an even more creative stopgap for the Syrian refugees involved: hosting them on two available Greek islands, using a joint-stock company to accept donations, Bloomberg reports.

    "document": "Security at Bush Intercontinental Airport stand at the bottom of the escalators as police investigate a shooting near Terminal B on Thursday, May 2, 2013 in Houston. / Cody Duty,AP Photo/Houston Chronicle \n \n Updated at 11:02 p.m. ET \n \n HOUSTON A man who had fired a gun inside a ticketing area at Houston's largest airport was killed after being confronted by a law enforcement official during an incident that sent people in the terminal scrambling and screaming, police said Thursday. \n \n CBS News correspondent John Miller reported that the suspect, who is identified as Carnell Moore, walked into Terminal B at Bush International Airport, sat down, produced a pistol and began firing into the ceiling. The two rounds that were fired sent passengers scattering in panic. The shot were heard by a special agent of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The HSI office is about 150 feet from the shooting. \n \n The agent ran toward the gunfire, continued Miller, identified himself as a federal agent and ordered Moore to drop the gun. Moore turned toward the agent who fired, striking Moore in the upper body. At the same moment, Moore turned his own gun on himself and fired. Moore was dead at the scene. Inside a black suitcase next to where Moore was sitting, HSI, FBI and Houston PD found a black suitcase contains a Smith & Wesson AR15 assault weapon with a fully loaded magazine. \n \n In Moore's car, more .223 ammo for the weapon was found. Earlier in the day, Moore had posted on social media that he intended to commit a mass shooting today. A handwritten note found on Moore's body said he had changed his mind and wanted to kill himself. \n \n An autopsy will be conducted Friday. \n \n The terminal was closed immediately after the shooting. But later Thursday, parts of the terminal were reopened to passengers. The rest of the airport remained open after the shooting. \n \n Darian Ward, a spokeswoman for the Houston Airport System, said some passengers who were scheduled to leave from Terminal B were rerouted to other terminals. \n \n Dale Howard, of Tomball, was at the baggage handling area of the airport waiting for his sister to arrive on an incoming flight when he heard two shots fired from the floor above. A few seconds later, he said he heard three more shots. \n \n \"People were screaming. I knew exactly what it was \u0097 gunfire,\" Howard said. \n \n Police from an adjacent station rushed in, and Howard said he directed them to the floor above. \n \n Greg Newburn, who was in the terminal waiting for a flight to Oklahoma City, said he was sitting in a cafe area when he heard two gunshots and after a pause, several more. \n \n \"It seemed like quite a few shots. Everyone was scrambling, running left and running right, turning tables up and hiding behind tables. Nobody knew what was happening. I couldn't tell where the shots were coming from,\" he said. \n \n Newburn, from Gainesville, Fla., said it took him a few seconds to realize that the shots had come from the ticketing area, near the security checkpoint. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| Page 1 of 1 \n \n UPDATE: Houston police just released this portion of Carnell Marcus Moore's suicide note that they say was written on Hotel Derek stationery: \n \n \n \n \"Here in the last hour, I yield to mercy when this could have turned bad. Jehovah found a path to my heart, that love would conquer anger. The monster within me was getting stronger and while I could not save myself I could spare others. [redacted] Peace is within sight. I ask that authorities handle my disposal \u2013 Carnell Marcus Moore\" \n \n ________ \n \n A Beaumont man shot and killed Thursday at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport was a reserved person of few words, neighbors said. \n \n But 29-year-old Carnell Marcus Moore wrote of death on his Facebook page earlier Thursday and, according to Houston police, apparently left a suicide note that said he was having trouble controlling his \"monster inside.\" \n \n Moore was killed in gunfire about 1:35 p.m. near a Terminal B ticket counter. It is unclear who fired the fatal shot. \n \n HPD spokesman Kese Smith said an armed male in his early 30s entered the airport and fired at least once into the ceiling just inside the doors of the terminal's pre-security departure area. \n \n Hearing the gunfire, a Homeland Security Investigations agent came out of his office and confronted Moore, ordering him to put down the gun, Smith said. \n \n When Moore refused the command, the officer pulled out his weapon and the man turned toward him, Smith said. \n \n The agent fired once, and Moore shot himself - apparently at the same time, according to Smith. Moore died at the scene. No one else was injured. \n \n Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, said an autopsy was expected to be performed on Friday. \n \n Hours after the shooting, officers were at Moore's home in Beaumont, carrying out computer equipment, a neighbor said. \n \n Marietta Kidd said she looked out a window toward the duplex where Moore lived and counted seven unmarked cars in her parking lot about the time school let out on Thursday. Kidd said her father owns the home and that her sister is Moore's neighbor. \n \n Kidd, who owns a beauty salon on the same street where Moore lived, said he had been in the duplex for several years and that he never talked much. \n \n Moore spoke of death on his Facebook page three times since Wednesday. \n \n 'When I go to meet God' \n \n The first status update was posted nearly 24 hours before he was killed. \"I recently had the chance of staring death in the face, and she was beautiful,\" he wrote at 1:26 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n About 12:45 a.m. Thursday, he proclaimed that \"This Life Will Crash Tomorrow!\" \n \n And about 12:42 p.m., he posted: \"45 minutes and 59 seconds in God's Shadow and Time Stops.\" \n \n His timeline also includes a video of a strained and sorrowful spoken word piece called \"When I go to meet God.\" \n \n The lyrics include: \"What makes a mother's son decide that death is better than tomorrow?\" and \"This is not a life worth living. I already ruined it.\" \n \n According to his Facebook profile, Beaumont was Moore's hometown, though he finished high school in a Georgia community south of Atlanta. He graduated from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning program at the Lamar Institute of Technology. \n \n 'He was a good guy' \n \n Colleagues remembered Moore as an affable and kind man. \n \n \"He was a friendly guy who talked to everybody,\" said Tim Knobloch, 29, one of Moore's tech school classmates in 2004 and later his co-worker at a Beaumont air conditioning company. \"He was a good guy.\" \n \n The shooting scene was chaotic, passengers and employees reported. \n \n Tina Gellinger, a 40-year-old Kansan who went outside between flights, was coming into Terminal B when she heard shouts to \"run!\" \n \n She and others scrambled toward elevators and hid behind walls as gunfire rang out. \n \n Nearby at the McDonald's in the food court, employee Tiffany Rigmaiden heard two shots, then shouting, then three more shots. The 23-year-old said a Transportation Security Administration agent running by told her and other workers to get down. Instead, they escaped through a back door and took an elevator to a lower floor. \n \n According to Houston Airport System spokeswoman Darian Ward, Houston police and the FBI \"interviewed quite a few people.\" She added that there was no \"visible damage\" to the facility. \n \n The incident also interrupted flights. \n \n Terminal B, where mostly smaller, regional jets land and take off, was shut down for hours. Incoming passengers were rerouted to enter through terminals C and E. At one point, a ground stop prevented planes from landing at Terminal B. \n \n Mike Glenn and Cindy George contributed to this report. Guiseppe Barranco reported from Beaumont.",

His is the 2,651st tribute to celebrity on the sidewalks of Los Angeles, and during his speech, the Doggfather wanted to thank the man responsible for all of his success: Tha Snoop D-o-double g. \n \n \n \n Snoop has definitely earned some tangible appreciation for his career, selling over 23.5 million albums in the United States and 37 million albums worldwide. And since he seems to be the Susan Lucci of the Grammys with 17 nominations, an zero wins, the Walk of Fame is a big deal. So when it came time for Snoop to recognize the person whose hard work and tenacity paved the way for the honor, naturally, the artist formerly known as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Snoop Lion gave thanks to the most important member of his squad: himself. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Snoop\u2019s been having a good year: His most recent album, Snoop Dogg Presents Bible Of Love, topped the gospel charts in March, and Redemption Of A Dogg, the semi-autobiographical musical that he\u2019s starring in, has just finished up its autumn tour. His new cookbook (From Crook To Cook: Platinum Recipes From Tha Boss Dogg\u2019s Kitchen) is available wherever books are sold, his GGN news show is coming soon in adapted form to film and television, and his game show (Snoop Dogg Presents The Joker\u2019s Wild,) is returning to TBS next year. \n \n And, if that wasn\u2019t enough, earlier this year Snoop Dogg set the Guinness World Record for the largest Paradise cocktail: a \u201cGin and Juice\u201d drink measuring over 132 gallons and containing 180 bottles of gin, 154 bottles of apricot brandy and 38 jugs of orange juice. Laid back. \n \n \n \n The fact that Snoop is indeed a hard working man/bad MFer isn\u2019t the only reason he has to shout himself out. While it\u2019s true that anyone can nominate a celebrity for inclusion\u2014including fans, the public figure\u2019s manager, agent, studio, network, or the celebrity themselves, there is a stipulation that whoever does the nominating also agrees to be responsible for paying the $40,000 it costs to install and maintain the star. That\u2019s why it makes sense for talent (or their family or studio) to nominate themselves \u2014$40k is a lot of money, even if you have eleventy billion income generating projects like Snoop does. \n \n ||||| Grammy-nominated rapper Snoop Dogg received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ahead of the 25th anniversary of his debut album \"Doggystyle.\" (Published Monday, Nov. 19, 2018) \n \n Rapper Snoop Dogg, a 16-time Grammy nominee, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Monday, four days before the 25th anniversary of the release of his debut album \"Doggystyle.\" \n \n Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, record producer Quincy Jones and the rapper Dr. Dre were among those attending the ceremony in front of the El Capitan Entertainment Center on Hollywood Boulevard where Kimmel's show is taped. \n \n After thanking friends and family, Snoop Dogg ended his acceptance speech by quipping, \"I want to thank me.\" \n \n \"I want to thank me for believing in me,\" he said. \"I want to thank me for doing all this hard work.

The company is reviewing taking legal action against both KTVU-TV and the NTSB.\" \n \n \n \n Update: The NTSB has released a statement stating an intern is responsible for confirming the incorrect names. Sounds like someone's summer internship is over. \n \n KTVU has also provided further explanation into why they said these names on air: They didn't say them out loud before rattling them off during their live taping and they didn't confirm with the NTSB employee (intern) on their position within the organization. They did, however, call to verify the correct spelling of the names. \n \n \n \n Update: Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the NTSB, just confirmed to SF Weekly that the NTSB did not release the names of the pilots of flight 214 to KTVU, or any news organization, for that matter. \n \n \n \n Original Story: Local station KTVU totally screwed up the names of Asiana Flight 214 pilots when announcing them on live television today, and we're a little worried the name \"Ho Lee Fuk\" might actually go down in history. \n \n So just to correct the record: The ill-fated Boeing 777 wasn't actually being steered by Mr. Fuk and his co-pilots Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, and Bang Ding Ow. \n \n KTVU rushed to fix the blunder and issued an apology,blaming the NTSB for the fuck-up. The apology didn't do much to stop screenshots of the offensive names from making their rounds through the blogosphere. \n \n Oh, look -- here they are: \n \n And here's a video of the newscaster announcing the names with complete sincerity -- with \"Fuk\" pronounced \"Fook,\" lest you suspect the station of impropriety: \n \n Note: Asiana actually released the names of two pilots -- the ones allegedly responsible for the botched landing -- on Sunday. Junior pilot Lee Gang-guk had 43 hours of experience flying the Boeing jet; his supervisor Lee Jeong-min tried to take over to abort the crash. \n \n Someone call Ron Burgundy, this is a story for him. ||||| On today\u2019s Noon newscast on KTVU, the station claimed it had \u201cjust learned the names of the 4 pilots on board\u201d Asiana flight 214 which crashed last Saturday. But the station was given bad information that made it all the way into the newscast. If you read the names it becomes immediately clear this is a joke, which went unnoticed by the newsroom, producers and the anchor. \n \n You\u2019ll recall earlier this week, KTVU touted its coverage as being not only first, but \u201c100% accurate.\u201d \n \n \u201cBeing first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a newsroom,\u201d said News Director Lee Rosenthal at the time. Watch: \n \n About 15 minutes later the station corrected its mistake, but claimed an NTSB official had confirmed the names. \n \n Earlier in the newscast we gave some names of pilots involved in the Asiana Airlines crash. These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning. We apologize for this error. \n \n > More: Further apology from KTVU president & GM Tom Raponi: \u201cWe sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.\u201d \n \n >More: The NTSB has released a statement saying a summer intern \u201cacted outside the scope of his authority\u201d and mistakenly confirmed the fake names for KTVU Friday morning: \n \n The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6.

First of all, we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out.\u201d \n \n > More: The AAJA responds: \u201cThose names were not only wrong, but so grossly offensive that it\u2019s hard for us at the Asian American Journalists Association to fathom how those names made it on the broadcast.\u201d",
    "summary": "\u2013 There's not fact checking, and then there's ... not even using your brain. A newscast on Bay Area Fox affiliate KTVU apparently fell for a (racist and offensive) joke, incorrectly reporting that the pilots of the plane that crashed at San Francisco airport were named \"Sum Ting Wong,\" \"Ho Lee Fuk,\" \"Bang Ding Ow,\" and \"Wi Tu Lo,\" SF Weekly reports. The network later apologized, but said an NTSB official in Washington had \"confirmed\" them. It wasn't exactly an official. Per the NTSB: \"Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft.\" The kicker, as Mediabistro notes, is that KTVU had just been boasting about its \"100% accurate\" coverage of the disaster earlier this week."
