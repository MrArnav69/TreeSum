    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists say they've made a \"landmark\" breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer's disease with an experimental drug that appears to slow the disease's progress in mice. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK say the drug, called erenumab, slowed the progression of the disease in mice by blocking a protein that clogs the brain with abnormal proteins. \"This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" a professor of neuroscience tells the Telegraph. \"If this process is also working overtime in these conditions, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation,\" he adds. \"However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people, and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases.\" The drug, which is still in the early stages of development, was found to be superior to a placebo in treating mice with a type of dementia known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The next step will be testing it on people with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. \"It's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease,\" the lead researcher tells the Independent. \"We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.\"",

Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \"shutdown,\" thus basically flipping the switch from \"off\" back to \"on.\" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 A Texas priest has gone missing after being accused of molesting three teen boys and stealing between $60,000 and $80,000 from his Dallas parish, the Dallas Morning News reports. Edmundo Paredes, who had served at St. Cecilia Catholic Church for 27 years, was suspended from ministry and removed from the church in June 2017 after admitting to the financial misconduct, Dallas Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners over the weekend. \"Now that we know of his criminal sexual acts, we want to get a handle on him,\" Burns said, adding that the diocese has hired two private investigators to try to track him down. \"The allegations were found to be credible,\" a diocese spokeswoman says. The diocese wasn't aware of the sexual-assault allegation until February, Burns says, because officials didn't want to interfere with the police investigation. But after a Pennsylvania grand jury released a nearly 900-page report Tuesday detailing allegations of sexual abuse against 301 priests, the bishop says telling parishioners at the former church was necessary. Survivors of clergy abuse in the Dallas area say they're not happy with the timing of the announcement. \"Why would Bishop Burns suppress this crucial information? Was it to protect the diocese from scandal?\" asked local chapter leaders of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests in a joint statement, per the Morning News.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Catholic Church has hired two private investigators to track down a former Dallas priest who disappeared months before sexual abuse allegations against him surfaced. Pastor at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Oak Cliff for 27 years, Rev. Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims\u2019 identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash. This February, church officials also learned of sexual abuse allegations, which were reported to police and found to be credible, Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners on Sunday. \"I recognize this diocese cannot cover its ears, its eyes, its mouth. We need to look at this head on,\" Burns said. Still, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests questions the delay in releasing the information. Officials initially said the allegations weren\u2019t disclosed earlier because of a police investigation. Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA. Per the Morning News, authorities there say they are unaware of his location."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Anthony Kennedy's announcement that he's retiring from the Supreme Court isn't going over well on the right. Here's what people are saying: At the Daily Beast, Elie Mystal calls the retirement \"a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is.\" In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia's death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50% of the time. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \"What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls 'Senate syndrome': One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins,\" Mystal writes. \"The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power\u2014President Trump has until the end of the month to choose a Supreme Court nominee to replace Anthony Kennedy, and Republican Sen. John Kennedy says he wants a 'good lawyer who is whip smart, who is not a hater, who calls the balls and the strikes, who understands the way Madison meant the separation of powers to work, and who will listen to all points of view.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The fallout from Anthony Kennedy's bombshell decision to retire from the Supreme Court continues to resonate, with President Trump saying he's \"honored\" that Kennedy has given him an opportunity to pick a successor. Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions."

Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: The head of the International Air Transport Association had previously noted the \"real and growing threat\" of a drone-plane hit, while a British Airline Pilots Association rep says it was \"only a matter of time.\" A recent study by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone underscores the danger in US airspace, with 327 \"close encounters\" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between December 2013 and September 2015, and at least 28 pilots \"[maneuvering] to avoid a collision with a drone.\" Frighteningly, aviation experts say they don't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane's engine, a Civil Aviation Authority rep tells NBC.
