"– Denis Finley has taken to Twitter to call Politico a ""whore,"" sniff about David Letterman's upcoming Netflix show featuring Barack Obama, and call for the destruction of all office buildings, but it was his tweets about a potential change to Vermont's driver's licenses that cost him his job as editor of the Burlington Free Press. The paper reports Finley was fired by honchos at parent company Gannett on Monday evening after he was found to have repeatedly flouted its social media rules. ""We encourage our journalists to engage in a meaningful dialogue on social media, but ... the conversation [should] adhere to our overarching values of fairness, balance, and objectivity,"" says an exec from the USA Today Network, Gannett's main brand. Poynter explains Finley's demise came after he reacted to Vermont's proposal to add the gender option ""X"" to ""F"" and ""M"" on driver's licenses. The Washington Post documents the Twitter exchange between commenters who were lauding Vermont's decision and Finley. After one user noted the news was ""awesome,"" Finley replied: ""Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse."" When someone else tweeted the recognition of different genders was awesome, Finley wrote: ""All recognition? … What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking."" Poynter notes some readers threatened to cancel their Free Press subscriptions over the tweets. ""'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,"" an editor for a string of other local Vermont papers says. Emilie Stigliani, the Free Press' planning editor, will temporarily step in as Finley's replacement.","– President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a ""victory for the people of Israel,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday. ""The president of the United States has made a great and courageous decision."" Netanyahu, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, said the move was in line with the country's ""long history of struggle against oppression and for the right of the people to live their lives as they see fit."" Trump announced the move Thursday, saying Israel had ""proved its power"" after years of ""attempting to rewrite history."" The White House said Friday that Vermont is joining Oregon and Washington, DC, in offering drivers a third option in listing gender on licenses. So M, F, or X. In liberal Burlington, where Bernie Sanders was mayor, it's not unpopular. And it just prompted one citizen's tweet: ""This is awesome! // #VT Is One Step Closer To Offering A Third Gender On Driver's Licenses."" But Denis Finley, executive editor of the Burlington Free Press, felt compelled to respond: ""Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse."" If Winfrey played brilliantly to her audience, Finley fumbled in recognizing his.",8
"– CNN's Piers Morgan thinks gun-rights proponent Alex Jones's memorable appearance on his show last night made a fine case—for his opponents. ""He was the best advertisement for gun control you could wish for,"" Morgan tells Politico, referring to the conservative radio host. ""That kind of vitriol, hatred, and zealotry is really quite scary."" Jones is the guy who started the White House petition to get Morgan deported because of the CNN host's push for stricter gun laws. The White House last night promised to respond to the petition because it easily surpassed the threshold of 25,000 signatures, notes the Daily Caller. But ""it is worth remembering that the freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy,"" said spokesman Jay Carney, suggesting Jones better not hold his breath. Jones himself, meanwhile, posted a video after his CNN appearance, telling supporters that ""if something happens to us, or we’re killed by crackheads, it was the NYPD or mafia they hired,"" reports Mediaite. Yeah, that's right: “If you don’t know that (Mayor) Bloomberg is total mafia, you’re on another planet.""","– Piers Morgan called for a ""day of action"" on gun control last night in the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings, and he's not backing down. ""I think America is getting diluted to the horror of these things: It's become too casual, too widespread, too indiscriminate, and incredibly dangerous,"" Morgan said on his show. ""Something has to be done."" Alex Jones, meanwhile, called Morgan's idea ""ridiculous"" on his radio show, the Huffington Post reports. ""You and I both know there's going to be another shooting in months, or even weeks."" ""If something happens to us, or we're killed by crackheads, it was the NYPD or mafia they hired. This city runs white slaves, that's sex slaves, out of here all day. This is mafia central,"" said Jones. ""They're thugs. I know what they are."" Morgan told Politico that Jones was the ""best advertisement for gun control"" because of his ""vitriolic, hatred, and zealotry."" ""I didn't feel threatened by him, but I'm concerned that someone like him has that level of influence,"" he said. ""There's got to be a level of discourse that can rise above what happened last night.""",3
"– New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was not happy about what he believed was a leak of information from his financial disclosure Wednesday—though it later emerged that the form was available to the public. ""In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45,"" Scaramucci said in a now-deleted tweet, per the Daily Beast. Scaramucci later denied suggestions that his tagging of Reince Priebus was a declaration of war on the White House chief of staff. ""Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks,"" Scaramucci said in a second tweet. The disclosure information believed to have enraged Scaramucci appeared in a Politico report late Wednesday. According to the report, Scaramucci earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in the SkyBridge Capital plus more than $5 million in salary from Jan. 1, 2016, to the end of June this year, when he began a short-lived stint at the federal Export-Import Bank. The New York Times notes that Scaramucci filed the disclosure form June 23 and under federal law, it would have been available to the public 30 days later. ""They aren't in process yet,"" Scaramucci wrote to the Times after being asked why he thought the report had been leaked. He didn't respond after being told it would have been available July 23.","– Anthony Scaramucci is out as the White House's communications director after less than a month on the job. The Mooch tweeted Sunday night that he is resigning effective immediately. ""I will not be a part of the Trump administration anymore. This is not the outcome I had hoped for,"" he wrote. ""Thank you @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. I will miss you!"" He added the hashtag #swamp, reflecting President Trump's promise to drain the swamp, and then included chief of staff Reince Priebus' Twitter handle. Scarmucci's first day as White House communications director didn't go so well, Politico reports. Politico reports that a financial disclosure form the Mooch filed with the government Wednesday night showed he has assets worth as much as $85 million. The form was posted online Wednesday night and quickly went viral, with many outlets—including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and Fox News, among others—reacting to it with outrage. ""In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony, I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept,"" he tweeted. It's not clear what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director's required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge, which is based in New York.",5
"– Scientists say they have the first physical evidence of a grisly truth from Jamestown: Colonists in the brutal winter of 1609 resorted to cannibalism, reports USA Today. Anthropologists studying the partial remains of a teenage girl—including her skull, jaw, and leg bone—say they bear the unmistakable marks of a cleaver and knife, reports the Washington Post. She had been, for lack of a better word, butchered. “Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,” says one of the Smithsonian scientists who worked on the project. “I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh, but it’s very strong evidence.” It's not clear whether the girl was a servant or perhaps the daughter of a colonist, or whether she was killed to be eaten or eaten after she died. Forensic scientists have re-created her face, though she will likely remain forever unidentified.","– The starving colonists of Jamestown didn't just survive the winter of 1609-10—they ate cannibals to do so, say archaeologists. They presented the reconstructed skull of a 14-year-old girl today at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, reports USA Today. ""The skull was split in half, most likely with a lightweight ax or quite possibly, a cleaver,"" says archaeologist Doug Owsley. Cut marks crisscrossing the skull and jaw of the girl indicate her flesh, tongue, and brains were removed. Those were traditional cuts for animal butchery of the time, ""all parts of the cuisine of the 17th century,"" he says. ""Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,"" says one. ""I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh. But it’s very strong evidence."" The discovery ""adds a significant confirmation to what was reported to have occurred at Jamestown,"" a historian tells the Washington Post. ""It’s one of those finds that literally is."" The girl was probably one of the newly arrived colonists, though not definitively identified. An exhibition devoted to the discovery will open this Friday at the Historic Jamestowne site.",4
"– Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial ""shutdown,"" thus basically flipping the switch from ""off"" back to ""on."" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes. (In other Alzheimer's news, how well you can smell peanut butter could predict your risk of getting the disease.)","– Scientists say they've made a ""landmark"" breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer's disease with an experimental drug that appears to slow the disease's progress in mice. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK say the drug, called erenumab, slowed the progression of the disease in mice by blocking a protein that clogs the brain with abnormal proteins. ""This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer’s disease,"" a professor of neuroscience tells the Telegraph. ""If this process is also working overtime in these conditions, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation,"" he adds. ""However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people, and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases."" The drug, which is still in the early stages of development, was found to be superior to a placebo in treating mice with a type of dementia known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The next step will be testing it on people with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. ""It's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease,"" the lead researcher tells the Independent. ""We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.""",3
"– Electronic waste is growing at a staggering rate—Americans alone chucked an average of 65 pounds of old electronic goods each last year—and it is set to surge another 33% within five years unless consumers and producers change their ways, LiveScience reports. Most of the waste ends up in developing nations, and those countries plus the former Soviet bloc now produce more electronic waste of their own than Western nations, according to a new map that tracks the problem worldwide for the first time. The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable—a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes—recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health. The rate of waste is so high because engineers are constantly creating innovative designs to lure people to buy more, an earth sciences professor tells the Toronto Star. ""Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?”","– By 2017, the volume of discarded refrigerators, TVs, computers, monitors, and other electronic waste will be as much as 200 Empire State Buildings, according to a new UN report. Last year, the world produced about 54 million tons of used electronics. That's an average of 43 pounds, or the weight of eight bricks for each of the 7 billion people on Earth. But by 2017, the world is expected to produce about 33% more e-waste, or 65 million tons. That amount weighs about 11 times as many as the Great Pyramid of Giza. China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons, while the US produced about 11 million tons—though more products are likely to be retired in the US. The US generated about 258.2 million units of used computers, Monitors, and TVs in 2010, 171.4 million of which were collected for recycling, and 14.4 million were exported. ""It's better—it's called the 'dirty underbelly' of electronics,"" LiveScience explains. ""All those discarded electrical or electronic devices, from cell phones and TVs to tablets and computers."" The US is by far the biggest producer, with 9,359,000 tons produced in 2012, or about 29 kilograms per person. Canada, meanwhile, produced 860,000 tons, or about the size of 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s. The map, created by a number of agencies as part of the Solving E-waste Problem initiative, also reveals that countries in per capita terms are different, with Singapore being wealthier than Canada. ""The world is changing quite quickly.""",3
"– Jay Leno has long said he lives off his standup money and takes the millions he gets paid for hosting the Tonight Show and sticks it right in the bank. So the news that Nikki Finke at Deadline Hollywood broke last night might not sting quite as much for him: One source tells her that Leno took a ""tremendous"" pay cut, and the LA Times confirms it was indeed ""significant."" The numbers require some guesswork, but the LAT thinks he went from somewhere between $25 million and $30 million down to about $20 million. Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around. She says the show is still a ""cash cow."" The LAT, meanwhile, says Leno's prime-time budget never got shaved when he moved back to later hours.","– Jay Leno is taking a $20 million pay cut—and laying off as many as 25 Tonight Show staffers, Deadline Hollywood reports. Leno, who currently makes between $25 million and $30 million a year, volunteered to take the cut if the show needed it. The Tonight Show is only break-even from a financial standpoint, a source tells the Los Angeles Times, and production budget was not reduced when Leno moved back to late night. The budget for the show now is closer to $1.7 million, which is in the range of what it was during his prime-time stint. ""I don’t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,"" an NBC insider says. ""It’s hard to go though those kinds of cuts. It’s more a network issue than a late-night issue.""",2
"– A 17-year-old high school student in Idaho signed out of his senior prom at exactly 9:32pm Friday, but he never returned home—a lone shoe, his tux jacket, and a busted cellphone were found near the car he came in, KREM reports. Kristian Perez's family says no one's heard from him since he left the event Friday night, and local police say in a statement in the Idaho County Free Press that they've obtained a search warrant for his phone and are now scouring his call and text logs for possible clues. Cops say Kristian's mom reported him missing when he didn't come home after the prom, which was held at the National Guard Armory in Orofino. Per KLEW, a police dog-sniffing team tried to follow Kristian's scent, which apparently led west from the armory, but the scent vanished right at the entrance to a parking lot along the same highway the armory is located on. Investigators speculate Kristian may have gotten into a vehicle at that location. Cops say in the statement that a possible sighting of Kristian in Lewiston, about an hour away, came up empty after they reviewed a surveillance tape and concluded the person seen in the video wasn't the missing teen. (The wife of a teacher who's gone missing with a Tennessee teen has filed for divorce.)","– Police in Idaho are searching for a 17-year-old boy who went missing after his prom Friday night. Orofino High School senior Kristian Perez was last seen leaving the prom at around 9:30pm at the National Guard Armory in Lewiston, KXLY reports.

"– Richard Dunn recently found himself stuck, apparently all alone, overnight at Las Vegas' McCarran Airport—so, naturally, he created an incredible music video of himself lip-syncing to Celine Dion's cover of ""All By Myself"" in various locations around the terminal. It even includes a shot of Dunn re-creating the iconic waterfall scene from Flashdance using a chair and a water bottle, UPI notes. Dunn explains, per Gawker, that his tools were his iPhone, a wheelchair with a tall pole on the back, a roll of luggage tape, his own computer bag, and the airport's escalators and moving walkways. He taped the iPhone to the pole or the extended handle of his computer bag, sometimes tucking ""different stuff under the bag to get the right angle,"" he says, and then placed it wherever he needed it to be, including the aforementioned escalators and walkways. ""For the escalator shot I had to sprint up the steps after I got my shot so the computer bag didn't hit the top and fall back down,"" he says. ""Quite fun!""","– Celine Dion's ""All By Myself"" was released in 1996 as a cover of her own song, and the music video for it was made by a guy who happened to be caught overnight at Las Vegas' McCarran Airport, Gawker reports. Richard Dunn made it all by himself, using his iPhone to record the entire thing. ""I had a person behind a ticket counter give me a roll of luggage tape before she left,"" he explains. ""Then I would put it on the moving walkway for a dolly shot. I also used the extended handle on my computer bag and taped the iPhone to my handle. I would tuck different stuff under the bag to get the right angle. Quite fun!"" Dunn also recreated the Flashdance scene using a water bottle that really put the video over the top.",2
"– Jon Huntsman is skipping next week's debate in Las Vegas to protest Nevada's decision to move up its caucuses to January, reports the Hill. Instead, Huntsman will host a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire. The Huntsman camp accuses Mitt Romney of encouraging the state to shift its caucus date to ""game the system."" Romney is expected to win in Nevada, and his rivals fear that if he racks up enough early victories, he will lock up the nomination.
